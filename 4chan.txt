Melania Trump gets more than she bargained for.

So, if she divorces Trump does she get half the country?
Does this mean she doesn't have to make Barron tendies anymore?

MFW I see Bill Clinton staring at my step-daughter.

And he sees me looking at him. 

And he keeps staring.

And his wife looks at him.

And he keeps staring.
I almost feel like this might have more to do with it than anything:

Did anybody else see that Trump did a Bane post as part of his speech?
She looked lovely today.  Lovely and fucking terrified.  
I just looked at her nuderinos and her nipples are more wall-eyed than my retarded cousin tbh
The First Trophy.
> mfw

Now that's a stretch.
Why did she look so scared today? Seriously tho I'm not trying to stir the glorious Trump stew. She did look a bit...Idk off I guess?
[deleted]
Isn't she going to stay in NYC to "help" Barron with school or some shit?  

Like she doesn't have 4 nannies and a boarding school to ship him off to.

same with mike pence
Well sure she's now in a gilded cage with her power-hungry master on ones side and the blank-eyed demon child she spawned to usher in the new millennium. You KNOW he would rather be with Ivanka than her any way. 
Melania Trump is now the GOLD standard

TFW your husband forgets that you were an illegal immigrant and launches a crusade against illegal immigration
>upset with the state of the country

Right, that's why most businessmen do what they do, because they care about the country. 
Pretty much
Wasn't she a multi millionaire before she met him?
She wanted a nice life without having to do any work, and now she's the First Lady of the United States. Sounds like she got exactly what she wanted.
She looked terrified throughout the whole thing, like she was about to sell herself again or walk into a gang bang with old men.  
So will brazzers come out with some special videos soon?

Find me an Eastern European woman that didn't marry an American man for his money and I'll cut my own dick off and eat it.

My wife is Russian.  I'm very, very confident.
I still contend Trump only ran to win and shove it to Obama because of the roast at the correspondence dinner. Like he doesn't like Obama, then the roast. Yeah it was him getting today all along. Didn't think about the rest of the plan though it seems....
Watching the inauguration made me realize that the Obamas would probably destroy everyone in a Presidential cage match. (Presidents and first ladies only)
Do these people really think Donald was like "I'm so upset at the state of the country, I have to run for president"
She is Putins daughter. This is the smoking gun 
>tfw the first lady is a lady again
No millionaire runs for president because he is worried about the state of the country. 
Is she wearing a fucking ShamWow™???

I've read a few mod posts after they re-opened their respective subs. Some have been mildly informative, some were just "we did it because others did it", and some were more or less ass-kissing to the admins.

This is the only one that gets to the fucking point.

i can just imagine 4channers driving around a state honking their horn looking for shia's flag. glorious.

Shia LeBLOWNTHEFUCKOUT
True and heterosexual 
I was about to be really impressed if they actually found the location of the flag from the plane flight paths. But then they just saw a pic of Shia in Tennessee and had some autists drive around Tennessee looking for the flag until they found it.

I wonder if the plane thing is even possible, even if you had unlimited access to the pertinent resources that 4channers do not have.
Cross post this to /r/autism 
This is fucking fantastic. This is the perfect example of how people on the internet are dumb but the internet as a collective is brilliant. I'm waiting for the article mentioning the hacker known as 4chan.

Korean movie Attack The Gas Station has a scene in it that refs this issue. One character buys a pepsi from a vending machine and an older char berates him for not drinking a Korean beverage. He replied pepsi is Korean cuz it has the flag on the can.

To be fair Korea isn't. Both North and South like to call themselves Korea. Korea practically doesn't exist. 
And of course its USA. It's always USA

Apparently it was the 6th largest army at one point. 
This... This made me laugh for a lot longer than I'm proud to admit.

ISIS decides to attack Brazil

[deleted]
They would probably get shot by an off-duty cop in the meantime
I remember seeing something like this in /r/brasil.

https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/3tb2zz/estado_isl%C3%A2mico_queria_explodir_cristo_redentor/

Used google translate and fixed some of the English issues.

(CNN Special)

Documents discovered and kept secret by the Federal Police of Brazil, FBI and French police reveal that the Islamic State (ISIS), had ordered an attack in Brazil.

The plan was to destroy the statue of Christ the Redeemer, one of the most known symbols of Rio de Janeiro. They were sent to the hijacking of a plane that would be launched against the "statue-symbol of the Christian infidels."

Records of the Federal Police show that the two terrorists arrived in Rio on Sunday, November 1, at 21h47m, an Air France flight.

The mission began to suffer delays already in the landing when the luggage was lost, following a flight to Paraguay.

After nearly six hours of stress in many counters and communication difficulties because of bad English, the two left the airport, advised by the Airport officials to return the next day with an interpreter. The two terrorists caught a illegal taxi outside the airport, and the driver realized that they were foreigners and ran two hours around the city to charge them more, to leave them in a really bad side of Rio called Baixada Fluminense. On the way, he stopped the car and with the help of three accomplices, the terrorists were assaulted and beaten.

They managed to save a few dollars they had hidden in their own belts to transport money and hitched a ride on a truck that delivered gas. On Monday, the 7h33m thanks to guerrilla training in Afghanistan, the two terrorists manage to get a Copacabana hotel.

Then rented a car and got lost in Rio again in a bad side of town called Rocinha and the car was totally hosed again but because of the terrorist training, they was got away. Returned to the airport, determined to just hijack a plane and throw it in the middle of Christ the Redeemer. They face a monster jam because of a demonstration of students and teachers on strike - and three hours were stopped at Brazil Ave,  near Manguinhos they had their watches were stolen. At 12.30 pm, they decide to go to the center of town and looking for a money exchange and exchange the little that's left of money.

Received fake$ 100 bills, they used $1 bills to fake.

Finally, at 15h45m arrive at Tom Jobim Airport to hijack a plane.

Airline staff and passengers are stationed in the airport lounge, playing music and shouting slogans against the government.

The Police came punching everyone, including the terrorists.

The terrorists were driven to the police station at the airport, accused of drug trafficking, they had bags of cocaine planted in their pockets.

At 18 hours, while the prison was being attacked by a gang called Red command, they manage to escape from the police station in the confusion and shooting. At 19h05 they run counter to the GOL Airlines to buy the tickets.

But the employee who sold them the tickets omits the information that the company's flights are suspended. They then discuss among themselves, begin to doubt destroying Rio de Janeiro, in the end, is a terrorist act or a favor.

At 23:30, dirty, sore and starving, they decide to get something to eat at the airport restaurant. They ask sandwiches barbecue with cheese curds and lemonades. Only on Tuesday, at 4h35m, they recover from food poisoning equine proportions due to expired meat in sandwiches. They were taken to the Hospital called Miguel Couto, after waiting three hours for help to arrived and had to wait for a bed in public hospitals. In the hospital, they were attended by an ugly nurse, thick, fat and grumpy.

Debilitated, they were only discharged on Sunday.

Sunday 18h20h: the terrorists of the Islamic State were out of the hospital and arrived near the Maracana stadium. Flamengo had just lost the game. The Angry fans confuse terrorists with members of the opposing team, and gave them an unprecedented beating. The head of the fanclub was called "Pé de Mesa," who used to sexually abused them.

At 19h45m finally they were left alone, in terrible pain throughout the body, especially in proctologic area (anus). Seeing a nearby bar, they decide to get drunk once in their life (even if it is sin, fuck Allah!). They take a shot of cachaça adulterated with methanol, got sick again and need to return to the Hospital Miguel Couto. Doctors also diagnose gonorrhea in swollen retofuricular sector (Pé de Mesa does not forgive!).

Monday, 23h42m: the two terrorists fleeing  Rio hidden in the back of an appliance truck, robbed hours after the Serra das Araras. Disoriented, hungry, unable to walk and sit, they are taken by van to an NGO linked to human rights.

Traveling laying sideways. They manage to escape from the Ong the next day and wandering around looking for food. Tiredm they end up falling asleep under a awning from store.

The Federal Police has not yet revealed the hospital where the two were hospitalized in serious condition after nearly beaten to death by a group of  beggars killers . The spokesman Federal Police stated that, after the two leave the ICU, will be collected on illegal immigrants sector in Brasilia, where they will remain until the Ministry of Justice to authorize the deportation of two poor guys, if the government finds money to pay for it, of course.

The two terrorists found unnecessary to attack Brazil and elect Rio de Janeiro as specialized training area.

Absolutely haram*bae*
What if ISIS get inspired when they see the Olympics so they decide to go back home to start their own. Theres a whole slew of sports theyre familiar with like Beheading Infidels, Bombing Infidels and Raping Infidels where they compete for who's the most effective and stylish in doing so.The competitions would do wonders for their morale and I can see it totally taking off
As a Brazilian, I acknowledge that this was fucking hilarious and true.
ISIS WE LOVE YOU, PLS COME TO BRAZIL
Isis doesn't pay for return trip tickets.
Let's not forget the drug addiction they'll have from their visit. 
I'm impressed they left out an encounter with the infamous water in Rio.
Turn it into a rom-com directed by Paul Feig
This is ridiculous. Zika wouldn't wipe them out. 

Edit: even though this ruins the joke, my point was that the rest of the story is totally plausible... 
That hacker 4chan knows the best plan to extinguish daesh.
Was it a cross dresser or a tranny. Get your story straight.

This is the most patriotic 4chan thread you will ever see folks.
This sounds like an episode of South Park.
This should be the sequel to Four Lions
Brazil is the Florida of South America.
It just dawned on me.  
ISIS doesn't hate Christians or Jews, they hate white people.
A group was arrested in suspicion of having ties to ISIS. Apparently they tried buying rifles and larger weapons abroad, did everything wrong and were caught.

ISIS also apparently denied any knowledge of this group, probably ashamed from their stupidity.
Wait, did this really happen? 
/r/UpliftingNews
I love that they still decided to rape the tranny
Zika Vs. Drug Cartels Vs. Olympics Committee Vs. Government Corruption Vs. ISIS

It's true though. Terrorism is more effective the more advanced and peaceful a country is. If you detonate a bomb in a 3rd world shithole you won't even get in the news.
I cried. Bravo.
Should change contracted Zika from a mosquito bite. It's not sexually transmitted (that we know of yet) outside of birth defects.


there's not enough water in the middle east to support that many mosquitoes...

also zika is harmless unless you're a fetus.

let's be realistic, the truth is they go home and tell their brothers how wonderful that big brazilian booty is and they all migrate to brazil and leave europe alone. then the us and mexico join forces to build a much more reasonably sized wall at the panama canal and the world's problems are solved.
saw the title and got excited 
Logic checks out. 
> Not knowing the difference between a crossdresser and a tranny 

Filthy casuals 
The amount of fucking normies in this thread. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'm super high right now and thought I was on r/pokemongo. Took me about 10 minutes to figure this shit out
So is this going to be made into a sitcom? It's something I would watch 
As a Brazilian I enforce this is totally possible.
You assholes gave me a heart attack when i saw the title on /r/all

Yep. Nobody out-Brazils Brazil.
That would be the only possible way this Olympics could produce any good.

Anon forgot the part where the off-duty Brazilian cop mercilessly shoots ISIS in the face on a street corner.
When you're less popular than a disease, that's something.
Would like to see this is a movie, Four Lions kinda film
Stupid infidel. Thinks that raping males is *haram*. Doesn't know about *darura*. 
i would even pay $10 to watch tht movie
They wouldn't even get that far.  They'd be deathly ill from the first drop of water they drink.  They'll get robbed at the same time, and be stuck there, FOREVER!!!  muahahahaha!!!
true story
So the plot from the movie "Signs" just with Isis instead of aliens?
Absolutely perfect.
This is way more plausible than you guys think

source: live in hell
 You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go in against Brazil when death is on the line"! Hahahahahaha
anon is always right
Best news I've read all day.
They also forgot to mention their shitty jiu jitsu regime 
Oh my gosh it's almost like it belongs on reddit.com/r/unexpected, huh guys! Because that was awfully unexpected, huh?

Anon has a field trip

Actually relatable, did this.

My mom started to ask-how much really? That is when the 4D mind chess began.
I would never have been able to get away with that, since my school put the price of the field trip in the permission slip they had to sign. Did other schools not do this?

> friend
And then get 60 to have some extra. 
lucky anon
in most schools in Ontario, all grade 8s take a trip to Ottawa which costs $300. My sister is a year older than me. when she was in grade 8 my mom had no problem paying the fee, but when it came to me the next year, the teachers told me that i couldn't attend because of my grades. i knew that my mom just didn't want to pay for me to go because i'm not worth it, and told the teachers that she didn't have the money. she did have the money.  same with electives: my older sister got to take the most expensive and most fun activity, but all my mom could afford for me was bowling. she could give my sister money for lunch everyday, but couldn't give me $2 for a slice of pizza on pizza day at school. i sat around and ate people's crust and kids called me a raccoon because i was eating everyone's leftovers. "i don't have any money!" she would always tell me, but always managed to pay for my sisters extracurricular activities and her own beer and cigarettes. 


when i was about 10 years old, i had my photo taken at school for 'picture day'. I've always been shy and hated having my photo taken. for the first time , i smiled for my school photo. while we were walking home from school, i showed my mom the photos thinking that she would love them because i was actually smiling for once. she opened the envelope, scoffed, and shoved them back in. with disgust she said " you look just like wayne" (she only referred to him by his name) , who was abusive and had left us all (i had 2 sisters at the time, 4 now.) i had this horrible empty feeling in my chest and walked far behind her for the rest of the way home. i'm almost 29 now and I haven't smiled in a photo since. i don't even like smiling ,period. 
Am I the only one who thought, "I don't need to go, I don't think my parents will have time money" so I didn't tell them about any trips?
Plan fails when Mom breaks out the checkbook.
Used to do this.  I feel like shit about it now.
Such is life in Israel
This reminds me of a something I did in middle school. I was on the verge of being suspended I needed to pay 60$ to pay for the property me and my friends had damaged. I was a shit bully in middle school, I was also doing bad in history. At the time my middle school teacher had her grade book open and I was able to change the grade from D to C with a little fine eraser work. Now here's where the money comes to play. I told my mom my teacher was accepting donations to "Hefers International" and that if we donated 100 we got bumped up a letter grade. I got the 100 paid the school and kept 40 for pizza and junk food. Yep I'm a fuckin shithead...
"You need to pay attention better!" Angrily shoves $50 to you*
Wow, am i the only parent that give thier kid money to go in field trips?
When my buddy's mom found out we took his brother's car in the middle of the night so we could go joyriding when we were 15, she called my mom and I was grounded for two months.

He told his mom I was only grounded for a week, so she grounded him for two weeks. 
Anon is a rich bitch
I guess I was too honest. Doing that never occurred to me. Hell, I would just hope I'd even get the money necessary to actually go. 
Fake. OP doesn’t have friends 
I have aids.
Almost like how overdue fees from movies came up to exactly whatever your mother gave you.
My mom once gave me 6 dollars to go to a renaissance fair with saying it was more than enough. It wasn't even enough to buy lunch.
It never even crossed my mind to try to pull something like this on my parents when I was younger. This was a good feel for the day. People who do this are cunts and should be beaten by their parents. 
Be me
15
Ask Mom for 20 for pizza
Buy weed
Go home with friends and eat all the food
Anon has smart friends 
My parents always wrote cheques 
my mother was never stingy for social events 
but for vidya i always had to get good grades else i wouldn't get jack 

miss those innocent days... 
Why were you all stealing from your parents when you were younger? Was I the only good kid?
dumb frogposter
A good friend indeed..
No one is talking about the friend who probably rolled a nat 20 on mental agility and bluff to dodge that asteroid that came out of nowhere to ruin his day.
FeelsBadMan nowadays all the fees are online
You people had to pay for field trips with your own money? WTF?

never has this meme from years ago been more contextually relevant
back when /r9k/ threaten a revolution last year I never thought it would happen. 

first they infiltrate /pol/, then they elect a president.

If I ever made fun of autist I would be very afraid right now
The pool is closed to Hillary, permanently. 
Fight Club moved out of the basement. It's now called Project Mayhem.

Hopefully they won't abuse their autist powers and do anything more autistic than this
Never underestimate the power of autists.
Weaponized memetics: Mass destruction. 
Shadilay Brothers, we fucking did it lads!
Old classic habbo
But what now? Paint the moon?
I can't wait for all the top quality memes we're gonna get for the next 4 years, great job prankster
The best meme is that /pol/ genuinely believes that they're the reason for Trump's victory.
I just want you guys to know I've never had any problems with any of you.
You know Reddit is back to normal when /r/4Chan reaches the front page of /r/all
serious question: why is it that 4/chan claims so much credit for this? Like what direct influence did it have?
WE DA PRESIDENT NOW
Pool is closed my negroes. July 2006 is when I started lurking.
Dear God, his public wife is 100% plastic and other artificial alloys.
Even if it's not 4chan which made Trump president, they sure supported him. I prefered when 4chan was just autisting in its corner and didn't think it had the power to actually influence the real world. I suppose we have to "thank" things like project chanology for making 4chan realize that it had some power.
Do you really believe that the Trumps victory was solely because of the antics of a Andean Condor talon manicure board and not because of people getting annoyed with libcucks in general and giving them the finger in the end IN ADDITION to Berniefags getting shafted and wanting revenge?

I believe the true reason is that many of Hillary's support groups were covert sleeper cells trained in jungle and mountain warfare by some unknown mastermind. It's only just the beginning.... 👌😎🗡
i member that, good times
Meme magic power grows exponentially.
Memed Trump into the White House, can't say I'm not impressed
Wow. I never knew the afro dudes on habbo came from 4chan... what a time 
Were coming for you normies
This is the first time I saw 4chan taking credit for other people's achievements.  If anything Hillary Clinton is the one who got trump elected.  She was so corrupt and disliked that literally all trump did to win was shut his mouth for a few years and let HRC get destroyed by her and her staffs own words.
All these autistic teenage retards are going to regret voting for trump once he repeals net neutrality.
Im in that top screenshot. Was great times fam.
What's the top picture's game called?
Ahh, the raid at Habbo Hotel was nice

THERE'S AIDS IN THE POOL

Welp, it's time to kill 4chin. 
Ya'll motherfuckers gone too far with meme magic this time.
[remember when the internet was a place of fun?](http://imgur.com/a/7qJhq)
not even the final form yet
I'm waiting for the headlines saying the "hacker known as 4chan" rigged the election.
Can some1 explain me all this, please?:)
To people coming from /r/all, this isn't a joke.  Donald Trumps presidency is all thanks to the mysterious hacker 4chan.  That's what you get for letting sjw's ruin video gaming and the internet.  You poked a sleeping tiger and deserved everything you got.
Hahaha 4chan wishes it was this significant 
/pol/ is always right
I'm literally sick at my stomach. My poor country.
Global communication is making meme magic stronger than ever. The possibilities are endless. 
What about all the school shooting pranks...

Revel in it, dip-shits. You're still never getting laid.
Majority of Trump supporters probably don't even know what 4chan is.
Ah yes. I remember several of my classmates put "the pool is closed" as their senior quote in 2007. I had no idea what it meant back then

 He's probably changed it to Warningpoint3 by now
It’s a post-it, why did they use tape?

How do you enhance a photo like that?
Pretty sure it has been changed to "warningpoint3" now, while next one will be "firingpoint1"
Nice internet explorer bro
Its probably just a password to log in not anything important u faggots
Weaponautism.
It wasnt false. It was a psy-op to test peoples reaction and how they handle a crisis
The password is on the computer screen for general use. It’s most likely not for anything important. I’m willing to bet that’s not his desk, but more of a station for general use. 
And they use the fucking Internet Explorer from Microsoft. We're all lost.
Shithole security practices
Deus Ex irl.
I only see *******
Wargames2 would be apt.
Is that also the EA Origin icon on the taskbar next to outlook and Internet Explorer?
that's what happens when you are required to change passwords often with all the characters on the keyboard as a prerequisite.

If you’ve been to Hawaii this all makes perfect sense. The locals are slow, and unintelligent, but their government (and most companies) will fight hard to makes sure they give locals preferential treatment in hiring, which might be arguably the right thing to do, but these are the results. It’s hilarious how poorly things function.
Who are these guys....
fucking users
Nobody is going to bring up that they still use IE?
This guys gonna get hacked and blame it on his little brother 
They use ie, no wonder the password is on a sticky
Jesus
What's worse is that they are using Internet Explorer 
And uses internet explorer, no wonder he can't remmmeber passwords, 2 much lag in his head
That's a decoy password you fools. Hawaiian shirt is 10 steps ahead of you.
tfw the password almost matches your real name
At this point I'm surprised the password wasn't Hunter2
>internet explorer
This is from the people who set the nuclear launch codes to underground missile silos to 00000 for 30 years

reminds me of Terry Colby from Mr. Robot, in charge of something huge and yet knows absolutely jack shit about it

[Yes I posted before reading and confirming that I am not original. At all. I will leave it up as penance.]
Wait they actually revealed the person?
For a second i thought this was r/crappydesign
His password isn't the worst part it's the internet browser he has open 
Diversity strikes again.
Typical idiot liberals
This is a perfect example of why anyone in an important position like this that deals with computers should be required to pass a course that teaches basic computer security. 

I can't see what password he used, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's something personal that could be guessed. These people need to learn effective methods of generating strong passwords. I personally like the diceware method. You just memorize a few randomly generated words.  It’s easy to remember and is secure. 

I don't know if it's as secure as using random letters, numbers, mixed case, and symbols, but it's a hell of a lot easier to remember. Sure you can write your password down temporarily, but it should be kept in a safe place. Not right in the open in where the damn press can see. Once the password is in your long-term memory, then it should be shredded.

Sorry for the long rant. This just got to me. I hope my suggestion can help at least one person. 
Third screw up: Pinned Internet Explorer to the taskbar seriously how in the fuck
Surprised it isn’t “lolifuckedurmom” 
Are we not going to talk about the fact that he uses internet explorer?
Fucking IE.

They also use Internet explorer

Have you every fantasized about being the first Human to eat an Alien? How would one prepare such a dish? Its not like you can just open the cookbook and look up some shit like "Filet of Gray", or "Proximi A La King". Woudln't stop me though, id butcher that fuck and get it on a spit in some nice hot open flame and just improvise. Mmmmm that is some good eating. Eating things that can travel between stars or dimensions surely would give me an edge and bump me up the food chain like an XP Boost. I wonder if I could get my hands on one of their Ships? Don't look at me funny, I've been trapped on this mudball for decades. There is no law agaisnt eating Interstellar Faring Aliens and stealing their Starships as far as I know. Whose with me? We gonna have an Alien BBQ and then take their Ship to that star with 7 Earths that fucking NASA eggheads just located.

Absolutely stupid.

Especially, considering that we've been here for thousands of years already.

No need to worry about an invasion either.

There's too much combined wealth invested here for any one species to risk pissing off the other.

Make sense you stupid space jerks 
I know some people don't believe in that shit but I do I think disclosure is coming soon
If aiens existed I am sure they would give us a wide berth. 
We kill ourselves, we kill each other (we kill other so well we have a word special for doing it on a mass scale - genocide), we pollute, were stupid, we inbreed, we rape, we abuse, we hate and we kill other species (even if there no threat to us). 
The last one alone would make any intelligent life to consider us beneath them. 
I didn't know aliens were autistic too
Because we're insufficiently progressive.
Seems legit
ayy
Ask the alien to Skype otherwise it's a Catfish.
This alien has sideburns.
