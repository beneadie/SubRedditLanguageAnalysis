How to get rich selling singles at a GP

Good money-laundering method. Get paid $20 for some cards; print a receipt that says you got $200; put $180 in bank-heist money in your till. 
I work for a record shop. Some of my customers will pay in cash and card so the wife doesn't know they just spent $300 on some records. 

The life of married collectors, man.

Subject matter expert here. Just buy $4.95 of cards on a seperate receipt/transaction. Leave that one in your wallet/car/laying around. Easy. 
And it's even better if the wife finds out and comes back with the receipt demanding a $125 refund on a mox jet, you'll be super glad to refund the "full value" of what the husband paid.
Lol, that's rad...and sad...
It took a decade to get both my wife and I to be honest with each other about our spending. It took completely shared back accounts first, with no secrets. Then it took a few financial hardships caused by both of us over spending because we didn't approach each other about the other's spending.

Then we set up free checking accounts for each of us, budgeted how much each of us receive each pay day, into our respective accounts. That money is to do with what we want, without any worry about criticism. When it runs out, it's out. If we want anything of significant value then we save up. We're not able to cause financial hardship on either of us this way.

We have a joint savings and we decide together what that is spent on. We put money into it as a couple and withdraw as a couple.

Money is not reallysomething we argue about any more. If it is something we argue about, it's one of us helping the other see a poor lifestyle choice one or both of us have made. Because it's joint money there's no me, it's always about us.
I'd pay that.
Couples often have money set aside as, 'do what you will' money.  It keeps the peace because it's money that your SO doesn't account for as it's directly, strictly the others' property.  This receipt being needed sounds to me like a marriage that hasn't taken the time to have a set aside reserve for their hobbies and interests.  
You gotta find someone with a wife first.
How dare they assume I have a wife!
/r/MechanicalKeyboards 
That unfortunately works for WAY to many hobbies...
From personal experience, I will say that I wish gun dealers and 4x4 parts dealers would do the same thing.

When I am gone, I just pray that my significant other does not sell my guns and truck stuff for what I told her I paid for them
So thattttss why my dad always uses cash!

this was originally at a reptile show
Would also work in reverse at a jewelry shop
i never got this, as long as the bills are paid why should anybody care how much you spend on your hobbies. Called disposable income for a reason
My wife would return the cards and get the $4.95 back...
Aaaaand the image is already in my facebook feed in a different context.... that was quick
ahahhahahaahhaahahahahahah
Joke's in the vendor! My wife balances the checkbook AND buys magic cards! -s
That's funny and awesome. But is that actually legal?

Just curious. 
Honestly, I would be the wife spending too much money just to have a fully foiled out deck lol
I was really hoping this would be a picture of Rich Hagon selling some singles at a GP.
You did it, m8. You got the highest voted post of all time for /r/MagicTCG. (Well, it's not right this second, but it's hit /r/all and appeals to people regardless of whether or not they play MTG, so you're likely going to hit 20-30k karma.)

You figured out the karma formula.
That's hilarious! A Magic: The Gathering player with a wife, classic!
I don't understand why someone would marry someone who doesn't approve if thier  hobbies. I'd marry someone who shares my love for my hobbies. Can anybody explain this to me?
**ITT: People talking about petty crimes to actual felonies they saw on TV and think work like that IRL.**
Ha magic players don't have spouses

Just saw this posted (w/o the MtG banner at the top) on the Marine Aquarium Conference of North America app, so take heart in the knowledge that we aren't the only hobby that makes your wallet mysteriously lighter :)
r/humansbeingbros
Hello, I just joined for the fifty fifty thing, how do I get there
Ummm.... their US uniform didn't give them away???
funny to see this here, this was posted by an associate at a reptile Expo.... i imagine it would work at a gun expo as well.
The guy/gal generates an actual receipt for the "novelty receipt" no one would issue a receipt that could possibly be brought back as proof of purchase... unless they use Reddit I guess....
My wife does the finances. This won't work.  
I'm Gerry Thompson, a Professional Magic Player, and I'm Protesting the State of Professional Magic by Refusing to Play in the World Championship
**The Current State**

1. Wizards of the Coast (WotC) does not pay professional players a living wage. This, in and of itself, is not a requirement. However, if the goal is to sell the dream of playing on the Pro Tour, there should be something in place to make that worth achieving. Between qualifying becoming more and more difficult, especially with the goal posts continually changing, and the lack of reward at the top, the message currently being sent is “don’t waste your time.”
2. Wizards does not promote its players well. “*Oh, Worlds is this weekend? I had no idea.*” How many people can name all 24 players qualified for this year’s World Championship? How many could name 15? If you can’t, don’t worry, you’re not alone.
3. WotC’s communication is notoriously poor. The new cycle pro system is confusing, even for those who created it. The best resources for what your pro status is, how long it lasts, and how many pro points people have is a series of fan made spreadsheets.
4. There are not enough Pro Tour invites to satiate the player base. As Magic grows, the top should grow to reflect that somewhat. Getting onto the Pro Tour is already difficult, but nearly impossible for those not located in North America. Additionally, a “first or dead last” system like PTQs creates very few people who feel like they accomplished something. It’s a system designed to create losers. 
5. Coverage is still abysmal. Over the years, WotC has received countless feedback, and all we have to show for it is an advantage bar. Worlds is using a pair of dead formats (Kaladesh Standard and Dominaria draft) and was barely advertised. Why would anyone watch this? If it was a timing constraint to have the event on the weekend before the prerelease, you can use Modern.
6. With people like Alex Bertoncini and Jared Boettcher still playing Magic, it doesn’t send a strong enough message to those who would consider cheating. I am not comfortable with thieves being allowed inside tournament halls.

**Some Anecdotes**

1) As I write this, I’m sitting in my Las Vegas hotel room, waiting for the tournament to happen. We had to show up on Tuesday despite most of us having no commitments until midday Thursday. Decklists were due Tuesday, which basically meant Monday because of the forced travel on Tuesday. Plus, that information was communicated very late, which threw off many of the competitor’s plans.

Leading up to Worlds, we were spammed with nine emails of varying importance. Buried in one of those (rather lengthy) emails was a small paragraph about needing to RSVP by a certain deadline if you wanted to have a +1, which lead to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/BenS8528/status/1041831801642278912) from Ben Stark about how his girlfriend wouldn’t be allowed in the venue. Several others chimed in that they were in the same situation with their significant others.

That was eventually fixed, but certainly not before it caused a bunch of unnecessary stress on the competitors and their loved ones. I both understand and respect the reasons for increasing security, but this situation is another instance of WotC’s poor communication. That was an important topic and should have been stressed rather than added to an email as an afterthought.

2) After Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, players had to figure out team series rosters for the next year and scout for potential sponsors, but it was impossible due to the lack of information WotC had given us. Is there a team Pro Tour? What if members our team fail to achieve Gold status for the last half of the season? No one had any answers to these questions. We were told to wait for more information and still don’t have all the answers.

3) Leading up to GP Sao Paulo, the [@wizards\_magicbr](https://twitter.com/Wizards_MagicBR) account made four tweets about the GP, starting only five days before. They mentioned three artists and a panel with two WotC employees -- Nothing about the tournament itself, nothing about the reigning Player of the Year or most recent Pro Tour champion in attendance, and nothing about the tournament itself.

There is room to promote new sets, artists, cosplayers, *and* players. Better yet, work with your visible players to help promote these things.

4) Remember Pro Tour Dominaria when Channel Fireball’s innovative G/U Karn deck was somehow posted on coverage? Their entire tournament was potentially ruined and all they got was an apology. These mistakes severely impact tournament integrity, are not acceptable, and would have been easily avoidable if those responsible for coverage were familiar with Standard and could recognize that G/U Karn was a new archetype.

5) Everything surrounding the [Silver Showcase](https://soundcloud.com/thecedricphillipspodcast/studying-the-silver-showcase-mtg) was a disaster. If you want to get fresh eyeballs on Magic, there are diminishing returns on inviting three Hearthstone pros, who likely share some chunk of the same audiences. Two of the players were former Magic players who left the game in search of greener pastures and were rewarded for it, not only by being successful, but by WotC themselves.

The format they played (booster draft with Beta and other old packs) isn’t something that can be replicated by the viewers. The format was also not the best showcase for how great of a game Magic is. Imagine if a Beta draft were your first introduction to Magic -- would a bunch of simplistic cards capture your attention by today’s standards? If you did enjoy it, you couldn't even replicate the experience.

The budget for organized play is already small, and occasionally, a large chunk of the money funneled through it is wasted on things like this.

**What I’d Like to Change**

1. Star-build. This doesn’t come at the expense of something else. Don’t be too proud to take note of some of the things SCG does. Create player-driven narratives, do interviews beyond deck techs, and have slides with player information. Professional players are the least utilized tool at WotC’s disposal. Many of them have larger Twitter followings than WotC’s official accounts. Don’t have the budget for players? That’s cool, we understand. However, a kit detailing what sponsors can expect from a broadcast would be incredibly helpful, as they are mostly interested in visibility. The Pro Tour team series was supposed to make things easier for players to get sponsorships, but if you were one of the many who didn’t know that Worlds was this weekend, that should speak for itself.
2. Hire commentators who can follow the game, are familiar with the format(s), and can provide engaging commentary. Other things, like production value and how to make limited interesting, can come second. Flashy animations, bright lights, and a huge purse might make players check it out, but if the commentary isn’t engaging, they will leave.
3. Create more Pro Tour invites. Allow more players to reach their dreams and play with the game’s best. More winners = more happy players, and happy players will continue to play your game and spend money while doing so. Don't ignore the LATAM and APAC communities. They deserve just as much chance to get on the Pro Tour as anyone else. 
4. I’d like WotC to value the working relationships they have with partners and various community members. Their actions have indicated that they feel like everyone is replaceable, but that’s only true if you don’t care about your product and/or community being the best it can possibly be.

**FAQ**

“*Won’t the pro player ambassadors help with these situations?*”

Maybe, but I doubt it. Pro players have had regular meetings with WotC officials at Pro Tours for a while now and very little has come from it. Our feedback is heard, but rarely implemented. If I thought having pro player ambassadors wouldn’t be more of the same, I would have happily applied myself.

“*Doesn’t the addition of two Pro Tours per year mean things are getting better?*”

Again a maybe, but I don’t think so. Pro players don’t receive additional benefits for these tournaments (including flights). While their overall equity rises with two more juicy tournaments per year, we also incur extra costs associated with travel and time, both of which are drastically understated. I imagine things become much worse for those trying to become pros in the APAC and LATAM regions as well.

Reducing the size of the Pro Tour is a net positive for the players already on the PT since their equity rises further, but what about those in regions where they don't have access to 15 GPs per season? North Americans took 2/3 of the slots this year and that's not an isolated incident. 

“*Why protest at all?*”

WotC is used to being in a position of power and leveraging that however they can. Why invest resources into Magic Online when it continues to make money? Why increase GP payouts when players show up anyway? Why help pro players when they continue playing regardless?

I want WotC to know that its player base cares about these issues and are willing to sacrifice in order to demonstrate that. At the end of the day, we all love Magic and want it to be the very best version of itself that it could possibly be. We have shown that we care by continuing to play the game and hoping that things get better, but that clearly hasn't worked.

\*\*\*

Finally, I’d like to apologize. The judges and tournament officials on site aren’t responsible for any of this, yet they are the ones who are going to be stressed and take the brunt of the fallout, and I'm sorry they'll have to deal with that. I want to apologize to the players. Worlds is the tournament I hold in the highest regard and I’d like it to be about celebrating the players' achievements rather than tarnish it by continuing to point out all the negativity surrounding the community. I also want to apologize to any fans of mine or anyone who was planning on having an enjoyable weekend watching their favorite game played at the highest level without any drama involved.

Also, we're letting this thread take over one of our stickies to make sure it stays visible.
Not often that people put their money where their mouth is. Be the change you want to see in the world. Kudos Gerry. 
This post is how I discovered Worlds started today.
I was a random scrub at GP Detroit 2005.  It was my first GP, I didn't have any byes, and I was incredibly nervous.  I managed to get to 2-0 at one point, but I still felt my sealed pool wasn't right so I sat down and laid it all out in front of me off at a side table.  (The format was Kamigawa block sealed.)

Out of the blue, Gerry sits down close to me.  I didn't know who he was and he was having a conversation with some other people that I wasn't really paying attention to.  After a few minutes, he asked me what I was doing and I told him that I was having a hard time deciding whether Shrines were worth it in my deck - did I have enough?  Did they have enough impact?  We ended up having a long conversation about how good Shrines were in the format, whether they fit into my build, and so on.  (I did end up sticking with them.)

He had no reason to do that other than to just be helpful to another player and be a good guy.  I haven't forgotten it.  Gerry's one of the good ones.  
I know this is potentially a big hit to you in many different ways, but thanks for sticking up for the rest of the players who love this game.  
  
Edit: Hijacking my own comment to note that it's the last weekend of the current PPTQ season. Next season is starting in 15 days and we don't have next seasons schedule yet. 
World is this weekend? Really? I consume a lot of magic content on a daily base and this is the first thing I have read about it.
I work in the MTG industry and I forgot Worlds was this weekend.
Gerry, you are a cut above the rest. I appreciate your thoughts and effort in doing what you are doing and I hope improvement comes out of it. I will however be disappointed to not see you on coverage and look forward to the next event you compete in.
>Wizards does not promote its players well.

This is something that SCG does very well.  I can name some prominent SCG players and can recognize them on stream instantly.  Most PT players I have absolutely no idea about.  
> Wizards does not promote its players well. “Oh, Worlds is this weekend? I had no idea.”

This is legitimately bad. I can't speak for anyone else, but the only reason *I* knew Worlds was this weekend was because it forced LRR to have their Pre-Pre-Release on Wednesday. 
For anyone not knowing - the prizes for the tournament range from $2.500 to $100.000. Not mentioning playing at the most exclusive tournament of the year (nvm the silver showdown :p )

Gerry is not only sending a big message, he is doing it at a big cost.

Gerry, I hope your complaints will work, since they are very reasonable. And not only good for all players (pros, aspiring pros and random new players at lgs) - but for Wizards also. Big respect to you for doing this.
An impressive and hopefully very impactful decision. You and all the other pro players put enormous amounts of time and effort into the game, and deserve recognition for it. We all support you!
In case anyone was curious, Worlds has a $300,000 prize pool for the 24 (now 23) competitors. This averages out to $12,500 per player into the pool that Gerry is ignoring in favor of speaking for the masses. That's incredibly selfless, especially in a position where large sums of income are tied to finish.

Thanks for being such a stand-up guy, Gerry.

Edit: as someone mentioned below, **if you are interested in showing your support for Gerry Thompson, I'd recommend subscribing as a Patron to his podcast, [the GAM Podcast](https://www.patreon.com/thegampodcast). In addition to standing behind Gerry, you get some cool stuff AND subscribe to a top-tier (maybe Tier 0) Magic podcast. I, myself, am a Platinum Emperion and haven't regretted it once.**
I didn't think you could go higher in my estimation GerryT - you've proven me wrong. You are the hero that MtG needs right now. Thank you!
Very commendable thing to do. Kudos
Good for you, putting your time and money where your mouth is. 
Organised Play seems like such a mess - I'd like to be a casual fan of pro Magic, but wouldn't even know where to start with the strange, byzantine structure of the thing. Promotion is definitely a big part of that, as is the lack of narrative around specific players (much of the battle is knowing the names and teams). If WotC want people to invest in this part of the game, they should listen up.
are you doing this solo, or anyone else joining you?
Gerry just won world's without playing a card.
Gerry: I wasn't a fan of you. Now I am.
Can confirm the non-promotion part. Didn't hear anything about the event from WOTC whatsoever. Really hoping they put the time to fix the system even if this means change it altogether. Good luck Gerry!
It's legitimately sad that this is how I find out that Worlds is coming up.
Gerry, I'm so glad you've done this. You've articulated everything that boggles my mind about Organized Play in this day and age, and I hope that this is a massive wake-up call.
Saying you will no longer support a broken system, that your image will no longer be used to further the charade of an attainable dream, no matter the personal sacrifice in terms of money and opportunity is inspiration and gutsy to the extreme. Utmost respect and support for your cause.
This is something I've been legitimately wondering about--all of this is built upon the supposition that the Pro Tour and the aspirational "star building" aspect of a Pro circuit is a significant part of the future business model WOTC has planned.  


Do we know that's the case? All of the above comments seem to make a case for that potentially *not* being the case. In other words, those "problems" are only problems if it's not exactly what is intended in the actual model.  


As an individual, I'm very sympathetic to the sentiment and many of the specifics listed above... I'm just wondering if it's an accepted fact that it fits with WOTC's plan. Do "we" know? 
Gerry continues to impress as one of the best ambassadors of the game.
This is it, folks: our generation's Chris Pikula.
Please stop wasting your money on Reddit gold for this post. Donate to Gerry as he is giving up a lot for this. Or add to The GAM Podcast. Don't give Reddit your money.
I already wasn't planning on watching worlds because of the dead formats. Thanks for giving me yet another reason as well as just being a shining pillar of the community. The work you do and have done to improve Magic from literally every possible perspective is nothing short of impeccable.
Good on you Gerry for trying to make a change, even if it may get you blackballed by WotC. 
I think Magic needs a full-time community manager. They just seem really out of touch, and it feels like all of these changes are relatively simple to implement, especially when it comes to their communication. If Magic wants to have any sort of presence in today's marketplace, they need to stop relying on cherry-picked one sentence responses to questions by Mark Rosewater as their primary method of community engagement. They've fallen behind and they need to put in some investment to catch up. Thank you so much for posting what many of us have been feeling for a long time but lack the voice to make a difference. 


1. I didn't know world's started today

2. I can't even name a single person in it. I've seen literally nothing about this.

Wizards is terrible at promoting stuff. I only learned a few days ago they sold MTG merch like shirts and hoodies.
WOTC just released a statement on stream.

>With people like Alex Bertoncini and Jared Boettcher still playing Magic, it doesn’t send a strong enough message to those who would consider cheating. I am not comfortable with thieves being allowed inside tournament halls.

yea this is fucked up. don't get why scum like that are still allowed to play
As a Patron of the GAM podcast, I am PUMPED that my support is likely helping you take actions like this. 
Wizards statement regarding this event announced on stream. I transcribed it below:

Early this morning, Gerry Thompson announced his intention to not participate in the Magic the Gathering World Championship. While we wish this were not the case, we respect his desire to make his voice heard. Many of his criticisms are aimed at areas we are actively working to improve. Pro player consultants are working directly with us to shape and mold the Pro Tour Club, two additional Pro Tours a year raises the overall prize pool, and commentators like Paul Cheon and Simon Goertzen are seasoned pros who provide engaging commentary. This weekend will celebrate the amazing competitors in Las Vegas and crown a 2017 to 2018 Pro Team Series Champion and a 2018 Magic the Gathering World Champion. There is still room to grow, and this is going to be a big year as we continue to improve pro Magic in 2019 and beyond.
I'd like to propose to everyone that reads this: as viewers, we also can participate in this as well. It's easier on us: doesn't cost us anything to not give them any views on Twitch. 

(Yeah, I know they weren't gonna get any viewers anyway because they didn't advertise...) 
Hi, I’ve made a reddit account because of this protest. I’m a big fan of magic the gathering and play it daily, however I have no idea who the pro players are i didn’t know ‘worlds’ was happening. I hope you get the recognition you deserve. 
Huge respect for doing this Gerry.
This is going to send some shockwaves in the community for sure. I’m glad you’re willing to try and make a change from the top down, and finally try and get rid of a lot of the “only room for the pros” on the pro tour narrative that has been spreading for years, where it’s expected for people to help pros in GPs even if you don’t know them, just because there isn’t enough spots for enough new competitors on it, and wotc makes it clear through things like how they do coverage and even it’s featured streams on its magic twitch channel that being a friend of pros and people working at wotc is more important than actually being the best at the game.
Gerry T! We got your back! 

To be frank, I’m not even going to bother tuning into Worlds this weekend, even in between SCG Baltimore. I’ll let the commercials run. 

Hopefully WotC takes notice of your words, actions, and the player base response. They need to realize that the multitude stands with you on this subject and things need to change. 

As a Modern only player, hearing that they are going to be fewer ways to get to the Pro Tour just made my pipe dream into essentially nothing but a once-existing aspiration. 
Doing this while you're at the event? That's impressively ballsy.
First of all, good for you for sticking your neck out and standing up for what you believe.  The world needs more people who do that.

But if I can derail a bit...

I'm a fairly enfranchised player.  Admittedly I don't follow much coverage of Magic celebrities and seldom watch streams.

But this whole thing feels very "inside baseball" to me.  Like there are parts of this where I struggle to even follow what the post *means*.

> After Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, players had to figure out team series rosters for the next year and scout for potential sponsors, but it was impossible due to the lack of information WotC had given us. Is there a team Pro Tour? What if members our team fail to achieve Gold status for the last half of the season? 

What?  Step into someone else's shoes for a moment.  What does that paragraph even mean to them?  This whole thing is arcana built on top of arcana.

And I think ultimately that bolsters your point.  I don't follow this at least partially because it's confusing and I wouldn't know where to begin.  And Wizards hasn't given me a reason to care about why you need 5 Planeswalker Credits to get a Golden Ticket and 12 Golden Tickets can be exchanged for an invite to a GLLDJQ and if you win a GLLDJQ, then you can fly to Mordor and participate in the FFROPQ and if you win THAT, then you get a nickle with Jace's head on it and that can be exchanged for a booster pack that might have a secret code in it...
They are giving out 600 second bans on the Twitch channel for mentioning Gerry T and the situation. 
For context, what are the LATAM and APAC communities?   
  \- Thanks
Just gotta say, as someone who has followed pro Magic for a decade and change, it's *absolutely stunning* to me how tiny the prize pools for top events are. They could easily all be *tripled* and still not come close to the other esports that MtG is increasingly positioned in competition with.

$12,500 per competitor in WotC's flagship tournament is frankly sad, in this day and age.

Good post Gerry.
I literally remember watching /u/NumotIsNummy and someone said worlds was this weekend, and he was like huh? Really?
I think i'd be a fan of the pros at worlds to make snarky comments when being interviewed.

"So Ben Stark how was Slimefoot in your draft deck?"

"it was great, just like it was great 7 months ago when this format was relevant"


"Hey Seth, tell us about your innovative take on U/W control"

"Why, this format dies the second this tournament is over, theres no point for any viewer at home"
Thank you, Gerry. Keep fighting the good fight. I sincerely hope positive change is just around the corner. 
I was introduced to MTG in Dominaria. I tried watching some GP to see how the pros played. It was damn near unwatchable. I couldn’t even see what cards they were playing, and the commentary was no help.

Respect for this. The Silver Showcase in particular was just a pathetic and embarrassing move by WotC.

Though I would like to say that from my perspective, coverage commentary has already improved by a lot in the last years. With new hires like several pros and former pros and especially Riley Knight, who in my opinion has elevated commentary to a whole new level, I have never enjoyed commentary as much as I do these days, maybe with the exception of whenever LSV was in the booth.

That is not to say that there aren't still massive improvements that can be made to coverage, of course.
It's ridiculous that it's Kaladesh standard. I for one do not want to see another Heart of Kiran...or scrapheap scrounger...
Frustration across the board is what WotC is bringing to this game. From beginners that feels intimidated on local game stores, seasonal players that can’t have a chance to play high level tournaments, pro players that are giving their life to this game and don’t feel rewarded, players outside USA that are left behind, a crap online client that only works on windows in the mobile era, and so on...

My feeling is that they have the best game in the world in their hands and are totally wasting it. Shout out to their game design team (including all different roles that are responsible for it here) but as a business they don’t have a clue on what they’re doing. 

I’ve been playing magic since 1995, when I was 12. Stopped a few times and every time I’m dragged back because I love this game. But I always get frustrated to find the same problems again and again. 

What a shame... 
What? Y’all didn’t find info about Worlds on their sweet website?  Should’ve done a search.  If it showed up at all, it might’ve been the 3rd or 4th result after 2014 Worlds and a 3 year old modern deck using Crucible of Worlds. 🙄
Hey Gerry, love the idea. A 24 person tournament with only 23 participating has got to look bad. Given that you think your talents aren't being properly compensated in MTG (and by WotC), do you have any plans to try a more lucrative game? Artifact, for example, comes out in a month or two and already has a million dollar tournament lined up. Do you think you or other magic players could be drawn in by the cash? Or would you rather try to make magic a better game for pro players?
I agree with everything Gerry has raised an issue with.

However, I would like to say that is my belief that Coverage has improved noticeably in the past year. I think of the variety of new commentators brought in, the GP Reid Duke Experiment, the advent and refinement of Time Walk. All of these are improvements that have been made and WOTC deserves credit for this.
Thank you for doing this. I hope they listen to you. I'm sorry you have to do this for the benefit of the game. I wish they'd just listen to feedback given through standard channels.

Again, thank you for doing this. I couldn't see anything wrong with anything in this post. <3
Magic is a truly a great game in terms of interaction, high levels of play and fun.  It's really something special and it's a shame that the people who are in charge of it have proven themselves to be such poor stewards of the game.  

Years ago, I played in Nationals, many GPs, a pro tour and even one world championship.  I wanted nothing more than to travel around and play magic tournaments.   I was so excited to traveling to tournaments and playing "on the tour..." but quickly after doing the math,  it was clear that the results required to make tournaments worth even the time and travel were just not anywhere near where they needed to be.  Even when I spiked a tournament, I was making more hustling retirees at the $1-$2 tables down in Jacksonville.  I would get frustrated thinking that if the tournament organizers just structured the payouts similar to a standard poker tournament payout, and still kept a good rake, it could be profitable for the tournament organizers and the players, but that never happened.  

I even toyed with the idea of starting my own unsanctioned magic structure with a decent cash payout system, but bailed on the idea for many reasons... mainly it wasn't really worth my time.  And that's the thing, I still play magic online here and there, but haven't played in a weekend magic tournament for years, even when they are in my city.   It's just not worth my time.  If the tournaments had any kind of decent prize support, I would have never stopped playing and would LOVE to fly to Anytown, USA to play in a GP... but the money just isn't there... Even when they have an insane amount of people buying into the tournament, the money just doesn't get back to the players.  That's why most people who I used to play magic with back in the day transitioned into playing poker.  

Poker gets to be a pretty boring grind though, and that's why it's such a bummer that the people who run this game don't seem to get...  If they had prize support that made it worth people's time, it could be something really great for the people that truly love it.  Take Gerry T for example.  I used to hang out with him a little bit back in the day.  He's a good dude... I'm surprised he's still playing magic "professionally" because it's just such little R.O.I., but he should be wizards of the coast dream spokesperson.  He was like forever the guy who only top8ed like every tournament, never hit the big one.  But he loved the game and kept grinding... working towards his Magic dreams.  Then he crushed a GP!  Then took down a Pro Tour!!!  Wow!  That's awesome, man.... seriously congrats Gerry T!  Now, here he is after YEARS and YEARS spent playing competitive magic, jet-setting all over world, now competing at the biggest magic tournament ever, Worlds.  Magic dreams come true right?  Wrong. He's so been so embittered by the state of the Magic, instead of playing in the tournament of champions, he outlines his grievances in his 'State of the Wizard Union Address,' and in protest, sits out the tournament of his dreams.  

Wizards should be embarrassed that they treat their players so poorly, it has come to this.  If Gerry T is this frustrated when he's qualified to play at Worlds (which by the way, I had no idea was today,) Imagine how the rest of the "professional" players feel.  I'm pretty sure the only actual professional magic players who don't have a day job are content creators who generate their own income.  I think I agree with most of the Grievances laid out by Gerry, but I think the most important one is the lack of prize support.  Whenever they show the lifetime earnings of the "pros," to me it's pretty embarrassing.   With some of these players that number represents like 10 or 15 years of play... when you do the math, even the top players end up with like 40k a year.  That's like saying... "if you devote your life and travel every weekend and spend $20k a year to support our game, AND if you are one of the MOST successful... if you play your cards right you MIGHT take home what a substitute teacher makes.... or maybe even a non-substitute teacher."  
This is how I found out Worlds was this weekend. 
I would like to take this moment to nominate Gerry Thompson as the Magic: the Gathering Players' Union President.
Wotc competitive play system has been a joke for years now, glad someone is willing to make a significant sacrifice to stand up and do something about it. Even for the weekend grinder, pptqs and gps aren't worth playing in and haven't been for awhile now.
This thread has more views and upboats than the Worlds coverage
Be the change you want to see in the world 
I follow professional chess and poker. I know the top names and I follow their progress and it is very exciting to watch the people I know.  Player recognition is really important to keep me current and interested in that sport. 

I don't play Magic anymore but I like to keep up with the latest news and it is really tragic that trying to follow the competitive scene is extremely difficult to do. It is a chore to learn the players, know when events are and to simply be able to watch them in an accessible way.
I had been under the impression, due to some twitter exchanges with Saffron Olive and some comments on the podcast, that you seemed a bit too unwilling to criticize WOTC, presumably from your time working there. But I was very wrong and this is the platonic ideal of putting your money where your mouth is. Thanks for stepping out.
That feeling when you get a bye at Worlds
I'm not a pro and honestly don't care much about any of your points, however, huge respect to you for making an actual sacrifice to show that you care. Very few are willing to go beyond the level of keyboard warrior and it's inspiring to see you go the extra mile.
Good on your Gerry. You're far and away my favorite Magic pro. I hope they fix these issues and your protest makes them realize how much they've bumbled the current system. 
Worlds has a whole bunch of dumb formats involved. I only heard it was happening this weekend because LRR did an early Pre-Prerelease.

I honestly was not expecting his post to end with a bunch of reasonable and actionable suggestions that don’t involve “Wizards needs to reach into their wallets” this was an extremely well written post Gerry, and you’ve definitely convinced me, based almost entirely on the strength and easy implementation of your suggestions. That was an excellent move and I support this in any way possible. 

If you have suggestions for what you think the playerbase can be helpful with besides “be loud about it to Wizards” (which I will be) let me know and I’ll be happy to act on it.
Gerry, I had no clue who you were, didn't know there was a MTG World Championship and just found out it started today. Nice write up, you are one solid dude. My fiance and I will play a game of magic this weekend in your Honor :) 
I haven't seen any advertisements for worlds.  However, I do see advertisements regularly on Facebook for that terrible Magic bejeweled blitz app or whatever the hell that trash is.
I have translated this statement into Chinese and reprinted it on the largest community forum.

I think your opinion on the competition in the Asia-Pacific region is correct. In mainland China, we are likely to have no GP to participate next year.

The link to the translated article is [http://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=15135236](http://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=15135236)
This is an incredible step to take and I'm very impressed. If I ever doubted you character before, I dont now.

On top of the benefit to the mtg community, I hope these actions can remind people how protest is more American than apple pie, maybe they can lay off a certain footballer and stop hassling them.
I really want to be able to have a sit-down, face-to-face conversation one time with this dude. 
I have decided not to watch. Thanks for going into depth in why you are doing this. I would have been rooting for you, now I will be rooting for you at the next event instead.
It's also worth noting that most of these issues were around prior to the Hasbro purchase so it's not all "Hasbro is destorying WotC."
Wait worlds starts TODAY? I've been following mtg news pretty closely because of GRN spoilers and didn't even know that ffs.
What can we do to help as players? It feels like a viewer boycott of Worlds would just exacerbate the problem, so how else do we support pro players like Gerry?
Thank you for bringing this to our attention Gerry. I had no idea it was like this which anecdotally probably proves your point. As a long time (on again/off again since '99) player  and very frequent consumer of MTG content I can tell you that I know almost nothing about the pro tour. Ive never seen any coverage or promotion. I never know when or where anything is taking place. All I know is some of the big name players and i've seen a couple clips of specific games with notoriety. 

The way that WOTC promotes the pro tour seems to be worse than the MTGO game client and that is really saying something. 
Worlds was an awesome event when it was a large pool of players. I loved watching the various “stars” move up and down the ranks.

Once it became the pseudo-invitational with arcane qualifiers it became irrelevant.

Get the best 100 players in the room, let them battle it out. Turn it into an all star game, and run a GP concurrently. People can come to play and also see the best players battle it out.
I dare anyone to bring this up in the live stream chat. 100% you'll get muted. Whoever is modding the chat has made it perfectly clear that they will not tolerate any chat that is in any way critical of the stream, event, or game in general, even if it's constructive.
I have the utmost respect for a player who puts potential personal rewards aside in order to make a statement for the community - and despite this being centered around pro play to a large degree, I do firmly believe that it's ultimately for the benefit of most of the M:tG community.

Most of the points criticized are easily agreed to. And that in and of itself is a testament to just how fundamental thee problems really are. "Game Sports" (since M:tG isn't really an eSport, even though it effectively plays like one on coverage) are no longer a niche market, and broadcasting them is no longer a niche component. That we still have coverage production values that would be more at home in 2008 rather than 2018 is deplorable to say the least. That we have prize purses that are a fraction of rival games' is ultimately self-defeating, because without incentives people will not put in the time it requires to compete at the highest level. That a company with two decades of experience dealing with a global events scene still cannot manage their PR, communication, event management, and global representation without glaring flaws and errors at every turn is mind-boggling. Even just looking at some of these issues from a pure business perspective, you have to be in awe of the apparent goodwill at the top of WotC that lets people keep jobs in which they are quite evidently performing with severe deficits in key areas - and I say goodwill because the alternative is grossly negligent management, which I would not want to accuse them of without more substantial evidence.

One thing that has not been mentioned in the OP but that I think is **strongly** connected to several of the problems M:tG is having is its continued failure as an online game. MTGO remains in a deplorable state, with several big streamers that play other games having stated openly that they'd love to do Magic if only the client wasn't so utterly unsuited to good play and streaming. MTG Arena has widely been decried by established players at the higher end of the spectrum as being too casual-focused, too exploitative in its business model, too flawed in its UI for serious play, too riddled with technical issues, and too lacking in key features to make it attractive to them - and it is the high-end players that drive PR, not the casual kitchen table base (even though those players are greater in number).

Where are good commentators supposed to come from? Looking at other games, it's pretty clear where they are grown and raised: on Twitch.tv . If you have a platform where you can develop your entertainment persona, work on your commentary skills, and practice a broadcast presence, then talent will make itself heard and seen all on its own. But if your online clients are so bogged down in problems and issues of all kinds, then nobody will want to stream it, or watch it - and then new talent will remain hidden, and people will move on to better-supported games where they can shine.

Don't get me wrong, SOME things HAVE been done. But it's far too little, and far too slowly. And not everything worked out. Not every new caster is really a good fit. But you can't replace them, because who would take their place? And then it becomes a vicious circle of settling for mediocrity, which turns away fresh talent, which further reinforces the state of mediocrity, etc. etc.

Maybe M:tG has simply been too complacent for too long, secure in the knowledge that for almost two full decades, there basically wasn't any serious competition around. But this isn't 2005 anymore. New games are released daily. Titans like Hearthstone and promising newcomers like Eternal aren't merely nibbling at the TCG cake, they're carving out slice after slice for themselves. M:tG has to change, and FAST, if they want to keep their share of the goodies. It's far from a sinking ship, don't get me wrong, but we're well past the point where we can just ignore the many, many holes where it's leaking in.

The support for pro play is an absolutely integral part of M:tG's representation and online presence, and at the core of its entire PR machine. Everything revolves around the big tournaments, and I absolutely agree that a STAGGERING amount of potential is left untapped, or is outright squandered by bad decisions. "You have to spend money to make money" is a basic business paradigm, and so far it seems WotC has either a very different opinion on that (and who knows, maybe business numbers dictate that other course, I'm not privy to their books) or they are making a very big mistake.
As an Asian player I really appreciate that Gerry stand up and express the idea. Recent changes looks really bad for players in Asia since there is usually not too much GPs in our region, with the new policy the cost of playing for upper is increasing a lot. As a player in China, players community has complained about the Hasbro CHN and the their local partners as they focus on profit too much but think lowly of players' experience for a long time. They did so bad at attracting new players, supporting new shops and supporting tournaments(They didn't support the broadcasting of GPs and PTs in whole 2018. Everyone need to bare the network loss to watch Twitch and those who is not good at English has more difficulties). People suggested them in many different way but they never listen to us and take any effective action. Recently we even heard that due to the internal conflict between Hasbro CHN and their partners, China will no longer have GP in 2019 or further future(not proved yet but the message has been spreaded widely). 

We love this game, but we really can't stand what they are doing right now. As the rising of other eletronic card games, we really want MTG still be attractive to everyone for joining. 
Oh well, I never played against or spoke to Gerry so I can't say I liked him until now, but after this, he is definitely my favorite Magic player.

&#x200B;

I have been playing Magic for 15ish years and I have decided to quit a couple of months ago, largely because of the reasons Gerry mentioned here. I have played many Pro tours (and missed at least 5-6 more by one topdeck), had a couple GP top8s, WMC top8 & PT top 32s and really really REALLY love the game but as he said, going for that PT is so unrewarding, such a disappointing experience that leaves you heartbroken that I just can't go through it again. 

  
Now I'm just sitting there waiting for the Artifact release date, hoping for a more rewarding experience, where your hard work and dedication can win you something other than a bag of disappointment. 
Hi, can we continue to talk about how much of a thief and cheat Alex Bertocini is?

Dude's complete garbage and has been caught multiple times. Why does Wizards still allow cheaters to represent their game? Makes me feel like they don't value the integrity of the rules.
With Artifact bringing million dollar  first place prizes, Hasbro needs to step their game up.
Wotc is a money hungry disgrace of and organization and when standard became extortion to play it's when I stopped buying cards. I'd say 2013 2014? Its ridiculous how many sets they continue to push out without any actual real development. Mtgonline is fucking ancient. The steam games are a disgrace and I'm not sure arena completely addresses that. 

There is so much they could be doing with the money they literally print. They really are a soulless organization and I wont support them anymore. 

I'm glad you are standing up to these morons.
[removed]
Honestly, look at Hearthstone if you want to see a competitive card game scene with some decent hype around it.

They haven't handled things perfectly either, but everything from casting commentary to player hype is pretty big.  Pulling in and hyping up big names from the scene (Like Dog, Thijs and Firebat, for example) plus getting big figures to provide commentary, really helped draw me into the scene at the start.

Basically, give players a REASON to give a shit.  
Gerry. The Original Magic MadLad
I listen to your GAM podcast. Hope to hear more about it on there and get to hear Bryan's take as well
Props. I won’t be tuning in in solidarity
I have the utmost respect for you in this decision that must be hard to make. 

MTG used to be a huge part of my life a couple of years ago that included me trying to stream it on twitch but I mostly stepped away from the game because of the endless stream of controversy and issues caused by WOTC being one of the poorest ran companies for one of the best products.

I'd advise anyone who feels the same to try and protest in similar ways, show up to less events, maybe skip out on going to a nearby GP or dont pay to play in events at them. 

The only way wizards will ever improve is if they know their poor decision making can no longer be held up by how great of a game MTG is.
It's interesting, since on the one hand the promotion was drowned out due to GRN spoiler season, and on the other hand you have to wonder why they scheduled the event to coincide with GRN spoilers in the first place(especially since it cut spoiler season short). 

Either way I've been a big fan of you for a long time and I still definitely am.
Wow this is amazing. Finally glad someone is taking a stand like this.
Gerry really took that Colin Kaepernick Nike commercial to heart.
If this was an industry that valued innovation and talent properly, you’d be getting a call from Wizards tomorrow with a job offer to spearhead this exact effort.
Huh worlds is this weekend? Who knew? Seriously, who knew because I didnt. Where did you find out because I'd really like to keep up to date on Magic Tournaments and what not.
I did not know Worlds was this weekend. I'm on this sub almost every day.
Wizards of the coast is a company whose one and only goal is to make money.  They do that by making a great card game, but their goal is to make money.  

To make the most money possible, they don't need to put more effort into supporting pros...... so they won't.  Like it or not, that is how wizards functions as a company.  

The way you vote in this situation is with your dollar, so if you don't like it, stop buying the product, but the reality of the situation is this doesnt bother most players enough to stop buying product.
Hey Gerry - well done for helping wotc market the existence of worlds, literally did not know until I saw your post.

Shame on you wizards, your business has grown year on year but you’ve done less and less to support those who give everyone else a view to what high level play looks like and how we can aspire to it, case in point look at the success of channel fireball and scg - that could have been your business.

In a world where every other game is growing their pro player base as a beacon for the community it feels like wotc is doing the opposite. Kibler leaving for hearthstone made me sad. Pro players playing poker to make a living makes me sad.
Gerry has Teflon balls. Respect for your integrity.
Must be hard for the others 23 players who certainly share the same ideas. 
I’ve been playing this game for 8 years and I have to go out of my way to find out about the simplest things. 

It’s a problem - but wotc doesn’t seem intent on fixing it in any way. I know more about hearthstone events and I don’t even play the damn game nearly as much. 
TIL worlds is this weekend
I get more updates from Christian Calcano's personal facebook feed about upcoming tournaments than the real magic the gathering account on the same social media platform.

No sarcasm.
Gerry T is for the people.
I’ve always cringed watching MTG coverage.  Is part of the problem that they don’t know how to produce a “Sporting Event”?  Whatever production company they use, they should probably fire them.  Or maybe hire one?

Creating a card game is hard.  Producing a show that’s about people playing a card is also hard.  There’s so many examples out there to help them elevate their game, but they seem rooted in some form of a poor cable access show.  A simple lesson can be learned by how they produce poker shows.  Commentators that know what the hell is going on and can explain it to the viewers.  Graphics to show their hand, graphics for interactions, percentages etc.  Heck, watch the way they create storylines/drama within NBA/NFL broadcasts.  

There’s so much potential to televise and produce this game in a way that would exponentially expand market awareness, draw in new players and maybe even incite semi lucrative endorsements?  Is part of the problem that this is not how Wizards perceive what tournaments are?  

On some level, they have to consciously commit to pushing Magic as they do professional sports.  What that form ultimately takes is the big question, but that will also have to  include professionally produced shows with commentators that have auditioned and maybe partially scripted.  

I could go on about this, but the gist...

Untap, upkeep, draw....
As somebody who watches a lot of streams from a breadth of games, the quality of WotC commentary continually blows me away with how god awful it is.  I love Magic and I consume a great deal of Magic content, however, I have found that the best way to enjoy GP and PT coverage is to mute the stream.  How many times have we seen the commentators be super critical of a pro's game choices only to find out that they didn't know how the cards work?  How many times have they hyper analyzed a game state incorrectly identifying cards?

&#x200B;

It's an incredibly difficult job.  I get it, and I know I'd suck at it.  I also appreciate the efforts they are making.  I appreciate them making the effort to bring in Reid Duke and LSV when they can, as well as the effort to source from streamers such as Kenji Egashira and Gaby Spartz.  It's really hard and they are trying, I get it.

&#x200B;

But the problem persists and it is consistent.  WotC is literally the only stream I feel the need to mute every time I try to leave the sound on.  I get that Rich Hagon and Brian David Marshal both love the game and have contributed untold hours of their lives to making it successful, but can we please recognize that neither of them should be behind the mic commentating the game itself on stream?  How is it that, when SCG commentators mess up card identification, they know seconds later but WotC commentators will go down the rabbit hole for many minutes?  How is it that Patrick Sullivan can be mostly retired from this game and still arrive to an SCG broadcast better informed on the standard meta than the average WotC commentator?

&#x200B;

I know very little about the production teams for SCG vs. WotC, but I can't help noticing that the end product of SCG's stream has much fewer of these problems.
Wait, worlds is this weekend? Like now? 


Wow. I am not the hardcorest of fans, sure, but I haven't missed a.pro tour in years. Also, I love catching random GPs whenever lsv/Paul is on Camera. 

But World's is this weekend? Really? First I am hearing of it. 
Gerry,

Years ago you and I played at a SCG Draft Open in Cincinnati.  At the time you were writing for them and pretty entrenched in the period of your life that you've written about not being at your best on a personal level.  Your attitude was reflected in your writing at the time, and while our interaction wasn't negative, it wasn't necessarily positive either.  I took great pleasure in getting the match win if only because I felt as though I was beating a bit of a villain.  But because of the fact we were paired, I have since closely followed the trajectory of your Magic career, and it has been a delight.

You have my utmost respect.  You have grown into a credit not only to the Magic the Gathering community, but to the human community.  Bravo.
My comment is just gonna be drowned out in the sea of people commenting here, but whatever. Gerry, this is a great move, and I think it took a lot of courage and conviction to make it. I also really appreciated that you acknowledged at the end that the actual people running worlds (judges, organizers, etc) are not the ones responsible here, and yet they are the ones being most inconvenienced. There isn't really any way around that if you want to effectively protest, which is unfortunate, but doesn't change the fact that this is a statement that needed to be made. This was a bold move, and I hope it leads to some real change!
If the economics of being a pro Magic player are not viable (which I can't imagine they are), then just don't do it.  Get a regular job, and play as a hobby.  I've found the concept of playing Magic for a living quite strange.  It's obviously not sustainable for most in the short term and destroys your value in the job market long term.  If you have the ability to play a deep strategy game creatively and at a very high level, you could probably do a lot better with your time and energy.  You also would probably find quite a number of careers just as fulfilling as pro gaming.   I realize I sound like an old man shaking my fist at a cloud right now, but, seriously, listen to what this organization (WotC) is telling you.  They don't care, and this protest will have no affect.  Protesting a company that sells a trading card game to give you a living wage is like protesting the government to influence McDonald's to pay you better.  Just get a better job.  It's a faster route to a less frustrating existence.   
I'm on board with serial cheaters being banned for life. Also like many of you, I didn't know worlds was this weekend. Looks like that one is right on.    


I thought this was a little weird - "WotC is used to being in a position of power and leveraging that however they can." They're a company, they make and sell different products that you can buy or not. I wouldn't call that "power" exactly. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with their using attendance and profitably to gauge how to approach MTGO and GPs.   


That said, I am one of those people that stopped playing MTGO and now rarely attends larger tournaments, because neither feel worth the price (most of the time). Maybe making changes would just be a good businesses decision. I don't know, but I'm interested to see what comes of this.
One thing about worlds that seems kinda stupid is using this super solved format for Worlds where more then half the players are running RB aggro. I would have way way rather seen them use modern or the new standard. Give the Pros an NDA and the new set early to play test then play with an open format that hasnt been solved yet so that deck building is more relevant and the matchups are far more captivating. I bet viewership of the first Pro tour with new standard will be higher then worlds.
I am watching magic related news every day, and i had no idea worlds was now.
I now at least know that you’re not attending Worlds, which I didn’t know was this weekend. 
Aside from the actual points and information being spot on, I would like to applaud the formatting and presentation of this post. This is a shining example of what Reddit posts (at least ones that present an argument) should look like. It is well organized and logical.

But also, yeah, I had no idea Worlds started.
Gerry, I remember about 3 years ago at GP Charlotte when I met you. It was day 2 and we both have the last name Thompson. This was my first big event and I was feeling chatty and was talking to you about the game and everyone around us, including a friend of mine were listening intently to everything you said. At some point I asked "are you a pro or something?" And you replied "well, define a pro" in my still relevant newness to bigger events and pro players, I said "well, you make money playing this game and can do it for a living" you laughed and said that in that case you were a pro. Since then I've pushed myself to be the best I can because if all pros were like you, then I wanted to meet them. You were so humble about everything and just chatted with a regular player like myself. I ended up meeting Tom Ross and Jon Finkel that day as well, and they were extremely disenfranchised with mtg and I didn't understand that, when this guy Gerry Thompson was so happy just to be playing a game. So thank you for being a role model for me as someone in both the mtg community and in life.
Serious question: Why should I care about whether or not someone can earn a "living wage" playing MTG?  


I mean, sure, I'd love for WOTC to put more money into prizes and stuff. But why should I want that to go to the top pros, instead of any other level of player?  

Thanks for bringing up a bunch of things I wasn't aware of.  A lot of these points would make me mortified to be responsible for, even the things that don't harm anyone.  (Old standard and DOM draft? Seriously??)
Huge respect. Anyone playing the competitive side of this game agrees with you. I'm amazed anyone would skip Worlds so I hope this gets the attention it deserves. 
Sharing this with my friends who like to play the game but didn't know about this. Thanks!
I wonder if all the people replying with "get a real job" (whatever the fuck that means) or that "WOTC doesn't owe you anything!" realize how fucking stupid they look?

Probably not which is why they wrote it in the first place. 


Gerry you're a bloody legend. Good on you for taking a stand.
go off king
Fuck yeah. Get em Gerry. 

Things can and should be better *because* the game is so great. 
Gerry u are amazing
The only reason I knew Worlds was this weekend was due to LRR shifting the PPR to accomodate it.
Gerry, you are one of my favourite pro players. I would have loved watching you play, but I love your choice of protesting even more. Imagine how strong a message it would send WotC if the other competitors joined you.
Gerry proving over and over that he is the man. Go get em dude. 
Thank you Gerry
Gerry, thanks a lot. I love your point about Latin America and Asia Pacific, being from Mexico I have the luck of a GP in my home country but for many players in other countries who want to go pro it basically boils down to PPTQ or bust.

Thanks for showing me someone cares about us.
I wouldn't have known about Worlds if it wasn't for the stickied thread.
1 step foward e 2 backwards is pretty much how they operate nowadays... 
Uh.. I love magic and wasnt even aware that there was this event, I'm not a hardcore fan but still, didnt see any ad
Didn’t even know worlds was this weekend. Great post though 
Fantastic post and decision. WOTC is world-class when it comes to game design, but is awful in nearly every other field. It's time for things to change. 
Can someone explain to me the Channel Fireball incident?
I wish they would make cards with the Worlds' Winner likeness again. 
GerryT everyone: the People’s Champ!

Gerry, I know you lose out on a lot in not playing this weekend. Know that there are many behind you, and that you speak for many without a voice. Keep doing your thing. We rally to your cause!
✊🏻
I get that Magic is this huge, unwieldy force at this point, but it amazes me how poorly they cross promote their various formats, platforms and competitions. I was watching one of the official GNR previews, and a viewer asked the designer if they ever consider the impact a new card will have on Modern. At first he laughed and said he couldn’t answer the question. He eventually came up with a non answer closely approximating “not really”. It’s fair enough if they don’t consider Modern in designing new sets, but they way he responded shows the disconnect that exists between the different areas of the Magic team. In fact, it seems to be one of the favorite lines of Magic employees: “I can’t speak to that”. It’s as if they compete against each other and work towards different goals, rather than with each other. Anyone who’s worked in government or a large corporation can see clear as day what goes on at Wizards.

All of this is to say that the lack of communication and cooperation within Magic is a big driver of the poor state of the pro scene. How hard would it be for them to have a notification on MTGO and Arena to “tune in to Worlds this weekend!” Or, if they get really crazy, do Twitch drops/coupon for paper products?” They’re still in the Stone Age when it comes to how they promote their product, which should be one of the easiest to promote in the industry. It will sadly continue until there’s a change in culture at the company or players leave.

Good on you Gerry, you clearly have a lot of support here!
Thank for your input and well written case here. Ill support you in the only way i know how to right now Gerry, by not watching coverage.
What's the best way to send GT money? Grindcast Patreon?

Edit: meant GAM podcast. 
Sounds like Wizards needs a project manager lol 
What an awesome post. I'll always love Gerry T so much.

I'm also happy that he got so much damn Gold for this post. 
This post is the Eminem Killshot response to MGK of the Magic the Gathering community. 8.8K upvotes in five hours. I honestly had no idea Worlds started today, and I played in a few GP's this past year. 
Direct example of everything GerryT is talking about:

We're on the actual MTG subreddit, presumably a place full of committed magic players, and there are a ton of people in these comments saying "i didn't even realize worlds was going on..."

If the people here don't know about it, how is **anyone** supposed to know about it??
 “*Doesn’t the addition of two Pro Tours per year mean things are getting better?*”

>Again a maybe, but I don’t think so. Pro players don’t receive additional benefits for these tournaments (including flights). While their overall equity rises with two more juicy tournaments per year, we also incur extra costs associated with travel and time, both of which are drastically understated. I imagine things become much worse for those trying to become pros in the APAC and LATAM regions as well.

&#x200B;

I used to try and grind my way up here in Australia with my friends David Mines and Levi Heinz. Along the way, I gave up the dream of being a pro and turned to casual MTG so I could at least keep playing the game I love, David, well I think you all know his vector. The point here is that you either get lucky and make it, or you crash and burn.

&#x200B;

Australia may as well be a dead zone when it comes to trying to go pro. And content creation? Good luck in trying to even get noticed when you can't attend every US GP. We have such a healthy magic scene, but we also have one of the worst areas for trying to actually make it in this game and that's a killer.
Gerry, thank you for speaking for the Latinoamerican community. I hope one day to see a GP Colombia.
Does anybody here have some insight on why things are this bad?   Tournaments and pro players are great marketing tools that are terribly under utilized in magic.  Who is in charge of this at wizards?  Is it just some out of touch, disinterested staff from hasbro?  Or is wotc just that greedy?  
I wonder if the corporate infrastructure of Wizards of the Coast closer resembles a board game company than an ESports company. Perhaps if they would restructure their Magic: the Gathering department and how oversight works, Magic: the Gathering would be a much better game.
I’d like to thank Gerry for his statement and for remembering about the community in LATAM and APAC.

My 2 cents would be that I had a talk with some WotC commercial team members last year, when they were scouting for a regional commercial manager, and mentioned some of the problems that Gerry pointed out.

Their reaction was that everything was taken care of, in other words they are completely unaware of what is going on in the ground. Or worse, they ignored it and don’t consider it a serious enough problem.

From a Business perspective, probably there is a serious disconnect between what the Marketing team wants to do (branding, E-Sports etc.) and what the Commercial team is willing to execute.

Or maybe it’s an organizational problem, as they don’t have a single senior employee in the whole LATAM.
Good job sticking up for the players. Its awesome to see someone pointing this out. 

Wizards need to realize it’s not just about the profit and scratching every cent out of magic community that they can, it’s about the people that play magic. We put them there, we can just as easily take them down. The amount of profit they make every year they could easily quadruple their expenditure and make it well worth everyone’s time playing magic. Basically stop being so stingy. 
Is it possible for a private organisation to start holding their own version of sanctioned tournaments? 

Image a company that decided off of their own back to run their own Magic Tournement which they were able to implement on a mass scale? 

Would they be allowed to set up their own competition with their own point scoring and "pro tour" taking it upon themselves to promote and manage and regulate their own leagues?

WoTC (Hasbro) are games company who make the game we all love and want to see thrive? They promote and run the professional magic scene because it helps promote their product. 

But they don't really have the knowledge or understanding of professional competition to really know how to run it on any more of a level than it currently is. That's proven by how much they have struggled and thry have been running these competitions for years and it's never improved. 

If an outside organisation set up and ran their own Magic league that was able to compete with what WoTC are able to provide then WoTC would have two options. Either support and enable to Organisation who were offering the alternative or improve their own professional scene to try and increase its draw.

The main problem with Magics current professional scene is that there is no competition for it. If you want to be a Pro, you have to do things the way WoTC decide to do things. If there was a legitimate alternative it would force change. While also showing WoTC the direction they should be going. 
The thing is professional magic players as well as similar games think they are the financial success of said game when in truth they only make up about %5 of the player base . All the money comes from the players at home playing at there LGS or similar places . Those are the people that buy t-shirts posters ect.. as a matter of fact ask the average player who any of the pros are , most don't care . You talk about having a larger Twitter following and YouTube status that's the reward right there smart pro players know how to monetize and believe me threw patreon I see plenty of non pros cashing in as well .  I get what your saying and agree with you , but just keep in mind the pro circuits is not what makes then real money as a matter of fact they probably don't make much after the overhead that comes with running events like this compared to the work that goes into staging said events . The juice isn't worth the squeeze in a financial sense .

Once arena takes off that will be the new professional scene .
I'm just going to be honest here, TCG pro in general just doesn't look appealing. Maybe, the pro wages is lower because it doesn't attract enough people/viewers to increase the wages. Hopefully, MTG Arena has a pro tour and bring more people into it increase pro wages.
Literally googling Magic (or MTG) World Championship Coverage doesn't even take you to the twitch feed. That's bad, man... 
This thread is the better advertising for Worlds than anything WotC did.
I just learned about all this nonsense today. It’s a pathetic state for a game like Magic to be in. Makes it all seem like a joke. It is just a game, a game which some of us love and are fiercely loyal to, spending any of our extra income on, and we’re rewarded with the crap. 

Now Wizards is cutting out local game stores. This is painful. 

Glad you took a stand, I’m just worried that nothing will happen and everyone will forget within a month. 
I think the problem is not the lack of coverage, but their focus, Wizards as many others(Marvel Comics/ DC etc) are focusing on minorities, we have seen this on cards, and the constant exposure of gaby spartz, they are trying to bring more players with the wrong focus... they want more whaamen not more players, this is money spent, they want more gay players, but the thing they dont fix is that LATAM is dead on arrival, the price of cards is so high nobody can compete only a tiny percentage of the population is able to keep up burning money year after year, travelling, out of the question.   
You need to be already rich, like Damo da Rosa who i dont know how managed to travel all over the world untill the breaking point of being able to live from the game, but that is just an exception to the rule, you pour so much money every newly released set that you cannot even pay for travelling expenses.  


The game needs less bulk cards every set and more reprints, this is the only way people will be able to compete in a leveled field. Competition will be higher...   


The difference between overwatch LoL, etc is that you dont need to spend hundreds of dollars every few months to keep up.  
Blizzard of the Coast does a fantastic job of promoting Hearthstone players.
Wonder what the WOTC backlash will be?
Coverage IS abysmal. MTG has a lot to learn from esports. I've never cared about the Pro Tour but I like Magic, I should WANT to watch. That's not on me, i like the game and the product - thats on WOTC. When I try to watch MTG on twitch it is SO over the top inaccessible - the casters are not relatable people, theres a lack of information for an average viewer that makes it hard to keep up with the game as 4-5 card names are rattled off and the overlay display shows me just one of the cards mentioned. Im not going to sit there fucking memorizing what every common and uncommon in Standard does so I can keep up with the broadcast. 
*Kaladesh standard*?  That just means the *current* standard, right? Like, no Guilds of Ravnica obviously...but the rest of standard?

Doesn't that make sense, though? They can't have Guilds of Ranvica cards when the set is still over a week away. I don't understand why this is a downside, can someone explain?
This is beyond winning Worlds. Your fans love you more for this than any performance you could've had this weekend. We stand behind you. 
You have all my support for this, Gerry. The promotion for Worlds was indeed so inexistant that almost nobody knew that it was this weekend. Also, not changing the format to new standard with Ravnica or at least modern is a huge mistake, because everybody is tired of the actual standard format, which rotates in only 2 weeks ! Finally, I couldn't agree more about the very bad GP-Pro Tour coverage production that Wizard is too lazy to improve.. 
Hey Gerry, this was a really interesting read. You won the first Pro tour I ever followed, shortly after I began playing (so quite recently), but were it not for the pinned post on the subreddit I would not have known about the World Championship at all.

What do you think is the cause for the treatment of pro-players? Do you think the people responsible for organised play are unaware that there is an issue, are actively ignoring it, or are aware but unable to help (due to policies or financial constraints)?

Do you expect other players to follow your example, or is this a fight you would even continue on your own?

I'm sorry if I didn't use the correct words to accurately express my questions. I am not a native speaker.
Fucking good on you!
  
Hope this will help :)
It's impossible to fault someone for putting their money where their mouth is. Professional magic is not a lucrative pursuit, and if it isn't sustainable, players have every right to protest and opt out.

I do think some of these complaints are easier said that fixed. Like, we've heard constant complaints about commentary over the years, but the fact is that Magic is an abysmal spectator sport. Everyone agrees that commentary needs to be fixed ,but people don't really agree on suggestions for how to fix it. Gerry cites the SCG model, which does many things right, but outside of the community's appreciation for Patrick/Cedric, SCG commentary is widely derided by the community compared to the WotC one. The difference between having PVDDR in the coverage booth versus someone of more moderate knowledge is probably very apparent to those top pros, but there's little sign that it makes a huge difference to the average viewer. And detractors continually cite the lack of playing experience of the commentators, but are slower to point out who they actually take issue with. Maybe they're just being polite, but I also suspect that each person has their own personal preferences, and people don't always agree on who is great and who needs improvement. Which makes fixing it quite difficult. "Star building" is a lovely idea, but it's almost impossible given how magic is actually structured. SCG puts an incredible amount of effort into it, and they're working with a very consistent cast on a much smaller tournament scale (compared to say a GP). And yet still there's little effort that it's actually connecting with the average viewer. 

The complaints about Wizards' marketing for the professional scene is certainly spot on. WotC doesn't get enough credit for how they've sustained this unicorn of a game in a digital world for 25 years, but it's hard to overstate how inept much of their business and marketing operations are.

But there are probably better times to debate all this. The Magic professional scene is brutal, and while some root issues have no solution (the fact that there will *always* be far more players who want to be pros than can be sustained,  so either you exclude the *vast* majority of pros from the system, or you find a medium where the pro player lifestyle doesn't earn much at all, and only retains those who are exceptionally invested, like we have now).n But that doesn't mean that specific issues can't be addressed, and this is a laudable way to do it.
I hope WoTC takes note and understands how crucial this is.

Gerry is a stand-up player and content creator.  Gerry worked at WoTC.  Gerry understands and ***lives*** Magic and its highest level.

Be the company you want to be WotC and restructure the prize pool. Make it worth a young man or woman's time to play your game at the highest level.  We are in the dawning of eSports.  Be exceptional, not mediocre.
I think it's clear you care a lot about some things,  but I think you need to be honest with yourself what exactly those things are. You're posting this because you feel disrespected, but clearly no one is intentionally disrespecting you. You don't appreciate the amount of resources being put into pro magic and how those resources are being utilized. 

You're treating this like you're protesting a wrong, and that's ludicrous. You're straight up just asking for more - be that be in the form of money, prestige, better coverage, more opportunities for others to reach the pro tour, etc. And that's fine.  But you're not being aggrieved and you're not being abused, and it doesn't seem like you realize that. 

And yes, I know you're thinking of other Magic players, but that doesn't mean you're not being selfish. Own it.
Friends at a two headed giant event

When you have prom at 7 but prerelease is at 11. 
Upside down, I thought it was Jim and Dwight
Got to play both these guys last night. Good people.
[deleted]
My work attire is long sleeve shirt and tie and I often just go straight to my shop from work. 

Had a team at prerelease yesterday say I looked very intimidating walking in with business attire and "briefcase" (Pirate Labs card case).

Need to work on taking advantage of the terror my attire invokes in others. 
One could say that these two are super friends ;P
That's fantastic!  It took me a few seconds, but now I want to play against these guys in person.
Really wanted to play 2HG at my local last night but we were the only ones there signed up for it. The store employee asked around a bit for us but since he was the only one working the tournament I'll bet he was secretly relieved he didn't have to run two at a time. Honestly it was the only reason we went to prerelease and we won't go again because no other store in our area even does 2HG. We wound up playing normal sealed and it wasn't a bad experience, just disappointing.   
That moment when they flip them over when no spells were played last turn and they're shirtless and flexing.

All creatures you control have Intimidate, yo.
[deleted]
"Holy crap, I know one of those guys!"

*Looks at OP name*

What are you doing playing Magic again and not throwing down the gauntlet my way?! Is it the 3 hour drive? It's the 3 hour drive, isn't it? 
Frickin A those mats are awesome.
Two-Headed Giant: Friendship in Magic
I've actually seen people coordinate outfits like this for 2HG before. Some people get really elaborate with their outfits.
Most well dressed MtG players ever. Respect.

Or are they Mormons and is this normal? :)
(I only ever see Mormons in suits here, not trying to take shots)
I'd much rather be playing these guys over the normal sweaty low higene fellas at my LGS
this is now the most upvoted post in this subreddit's history
These are literally the best mats I've ever seen. 
These kids have Speech Team written all over them.
The whitest thing I've seen today. 
Reminds of some classic Yu-Gi-Oh villians. 
Side note : anyone wanna give an analysis of the current board?
Death and Taxes: Cosplay Edition
guy on the right totally looks like Colm Feore playing Justin Trudeau
/u/likeagoddamnfiddle
Glad to see Jim & Dwight still spend time together...
I was wondering why he had a picture of Dwight Schrute in front of him.
A lot of people are commenting on the attire...


In case you missed it, check out the playmats!
TIL trudeau plays magic
This is amazing
Is that Bill S. Preston Esq?
The 2HG mats are great, but I'm still into the Day Job across the table.
Am I the only one noticing the floating cards in the lower right with no hands holding them up?
#BorosBromance
I don't call being overdressed as being welldressed as many people here say. If you're going to suit up there needs to be an occasion for it, not to just to make the impression that you dress well.

This is the opposite of sprezzatura as they say in Italy.

The playmats were great, however.
Now these are true friendship goals
[deleted]
summon user U/ob1fm
I'd be thrilled to play against Justin Trudeau!
Took me a minute to see the mats. Bravo. 
This is absolutely incredible.  You guys are killing it.
True friendship deserves all the upvotes
Dwight and Jim throw back 
One time my friend and I decided to go to a two-headed giant event at a prerelease. He picked me up and as I got in the car I realized we were wearing the exact same outfit: same jacket, same pants, same colored shirt. Only one person commented on it the whole night.
What...what format is this 2HG event? I see an annoiter priest and a golem token
My little bro and I were dressed up from a piano recital we performed at earlier, went to prerelease and named our 2HG team Dress4Success. The playmats make this picture so much better though.
These guys are clearly "Stella" fans. I dig it.
Classy.
Do you have a minute to talk about our Lord and Savior, Nicol Bolas? 
I didn't know bill gates and justin trudeau where into magic
Wtf is that Justin Trudeau 
I love everything about this
No offence your friends are fucking nerds
Anyone else see the deck in the bottom right floating ?
Doubleheaded douchebags is second only to legendary warrior as a format.
Initially I was like "why is this in any way relevant or interesting?" and *then* I saw the playmats.
The guy on the right looks like the druglord from 2fast2furious
It looks like they mean business.
Mind games like whoa
I didn't know the Canadian prime minister played magic 
Those playmates are the best!
Classy players
I didn't even notice their play mats at first, that's hilarious
That's cute af 
Am I the only person who thinks the token suit guys at every locals are douchebags? Ever locals has one and almost all of them are neckbeards. 
These actually your friends? One on the left named Alex?
But what about those floating cards of the opponent? 
this is good
Oh man I didn't even notice the mats
How do the decks work in this gamemode? Do you construct one double sized deck that gets split or for does each player specifically draw from the decks they built?

If it's two decks what are the strategies. For example can one player play a pure support deck or a healing deck? 

It sounds like an interesting gamemode. I'll go watch a game on YT..
I honestly thought this was Justin Trudeau playing Magic. Hahah
At first, this was funny.
Then I got a little miffed that my brother and I didn't think of this first!
I want to see more of these two chums. They look like they have a fun sense of humor!
This is very cute.
So gay
That's pretty lame lol. Virgins.
/r/justneckbeardthings
Well dang, I already felt bad for forgetting my sleeves on the way out the door, let alone my matched-with-friend playmats.
The suits reminded me.
I totally thought it was Dwight and Jim on the mats. 
Lol... Yes, flashing my protean hulk is another. ;)
Thought they were using tweezer for a sec there
Please feel free to submit this to /r/thatsmyplaymat!
Dwight and Jim
Playmats are great. Actual toxs are cringe city.
THG was awesome, but when WOTC released a 1/1 1-mana white flying angel that gains 5/5 when your health is over 30 (it's 40 at start) just to butt-fuck the THG system, it sort of died in popularity.
cringe
I always like prerelease... I sell all my MR and R to all the kids whose parents have too much money. Then the prices drop a week later and I get the ones I want...
A Forest

Forests from (I believe) all main sets. Guru lands, Portal, etc., not included. Images from scryfall.com. I'm sorry they're not perfectly aligned throughout; I tried my best. Perhaps some of the scans are warped.
Very nice work. Are you going to do the other basics. Colorless would be easist is my guess, maybe
I like it.  I appreciate basic land art and usually am pretty particular on which lands I put in to each deck.
Wowwwww! Really nostalgic now. It's amazing how many memories you associate with magic when you've played the game on and off for nearly two decades. 
Does the space the art takes up got bigger at KTK or am I just seeing things?
As a green mage at heart (long live force of nature) this actually made me emotional
This makes me sad about how much i like the card frames from invasion  and before in comparison to the ones past that.

Sweet gif tho

i thought this would be about the Cure song
holy....that is COOL. can you do that with the other lands also, please? 
Man, Mirage Forests are so nice.
All I see are a bunch of trees.
Running towards nothing. Again and again and again and... 
Wow that's cool.  I literally just bought my first packs two days ago and the artwork is fantastic.  (Dino nerd loving the Huatli deck)  Really neat to see the history from the perspective of a total noob.
Came for The Cure song.
"Lost in ~, all alone." ♫
God I miss the original card frame. 
Visiting from /r/all.  I didn't know that lands weren't printed with text anymore, and from the look of this gif it's been that way for a long, long time.  Makin me feel old :P
Nice montage. Maybe it needs a soundtrack... https://youtu.be/xik-y0xlpZ0
Wow am spook
Ice Age forest best forest. Fight me. In the snow.
I still love the Christopher Rush Forests the best. 

I'm sure that's partially nostalgia, but it's more than just that. That single large tree in focus with the pathway/forest backing it up (depending on art) just *feels* green to me. While I like the art of most of the other original basic lands, I wouldn't claim any of those to be my favorites or as emblematic of their colors.
Forest is what got me into MTG. [This Odyssey art](https://magiccards.info/scans/en/od/349.jpg), so peaceful.
This really drives home that the old frame aesthetics are the best.
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again

Well this confirms my suspicion that the art direction has gotten worse in recent years.
Cool stuff.

Any way to slow it down a little?
Should throw the full art lands in there, but still that's really cool
Awesome. If you decide to do this with all the other lands I look forward to seeing it.
beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a hardcore green mage, this makes me smile.
Fuck, I forgot how beautiful the Kamigawa basics are
[A forest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGT4V6JmINA)
That’s one hell of a ramp spell 
Do swamp, do swamp, do swamp
Unfortunately, my favorite basics are missing.

Yea, I'm the madlad who uses 6^th edition basic lands.
Can anyone make one of those average images of all the forests in this clip? That'd be neato
You've had a long journey friend. 
Man this makes me feels old. I still have a full set of revised from forever ago.

Edit: Hold the fuck up?!.... I just Ebay'd this shit, are you telling me this set is worth 2k now?
I bloody love this game. I wish I still had people to play it with. 
I just realised we've had the new card face longer than we had the old one. Wow.
Im here from /r/all.. I played Magic from revised through to prophecy and that felt like a really long time.. it puts into perspective how short a time span it is actually was for magic the gathering.
Strictly worse than an island gif.
as a legacy rg lands player i love this with my whole heart. 
Nice.
Need white borders.
Nice
This pleased me to no end! I hope you do the rest! Those arts took me back to when I grew up with magic. It brought a happy tear to my eye.
If you do this again, speed it up a little. It’d be pretty rad.
Neat!
Can I get that as an alter? /s
Moar pls. 4 more basics to do. Wastes is super easy 
I mean, yeah.
Seeing the half art versions of lands that are supposed to be full arts makes me sad
Really neat.
The artists of mtg cards do such a magnificent job of capturing the story in their paintbrushes.  That was a fun little ride through the mtg timeline!
I would to see more of this. 
Very cool! No love for the full frame lands though?
Into the trees...
My favorite land arts will probably always be the ones from Urza’s Saga. 
This is so nostalgia it hurts. Thanks for walking me through my life in less than thirty seconds.
This just reminds me how ugly and unoriginal the new borders are
So cool. 
Do it for the rest of the manas! 
What’s the one with the deer?
I like the Alara ones.  Something about the sun shining through.
This is AWESOME!
This needs one of those enlightened dudes where the first one is the "tap to add..." Then the second one has the tap symbol and text, the third is just the tree symbol, then the last is a full art.

Maybe have a fifth with just a crudely drawn tree on a piece of note book paper.
Try and spot all four of the monkeys!
ohh i remembered so many pictures from when i was playing with my friends in school.
Sadly no one i know playes it anymore :/
Love it.

Sad part for me is the further in it gets the less I recognize. Been out the game too long it seems. 
Damn, I was WAY into magic back in the day, played a couple pro tour tournaments, etc. and I didn’t recognize any of those expansion symbols after like 6-7 into that GIF.
 You made me realize I've been in magic for half of its existence. 
Spotted the Boob-tree.
[I opened this gif while listening to the end of this song and they synced up nicely.](https://gifsound.com/?gif=https://i.redd.it/lwqxxdyok1uz.gif&v=6lcZ0redg1s&s=305)
Can we get a composite forest render like all the human face renders flying around Reddit these days?
First 5 were good
Man, this really underscores how much of the game has happened since I quit, like, fifteen years ago. Super cool! 
chippy
[What about the forests?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRW_zVeRp9I)
What about Unglued? WTF MAN
This is dope! And I love how much of a troll it is that OP hasn't replied to anyone asking if he'll do the other basics haha
Really wish my mom hasn't thrown out all my first edition magic cards. Are those worth anything these days? 
I didn't know a photo slideshow could elicit emotions. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
Such beautiful artwork on all of these. I love Magic.
When my life flashes before my eyes I hope it’s half as entertaining as that 
It started playing after I tapped the screen, tricking me for a moment into thinking I had to tap them to go to the next.
As a primary green player, this makes me awkwardly happy.
Ice age had the best cards
Kept thinking the loop was over bit it wasn't! Very pretty. Like going through a forest of memories.
what about the forests that are just one big picture
my favorite song by the cure!
Great The Cure track.  
I'd love to see some sort of algorithmic arrangement of them by likeness to get these to, as close as possible, appear to "morph" the art from one to another. Surely unconvincing, but maybe less jarring of a change between frames.

Beautiful concept, OP!
I'd tap that
No Futuresight??
Was waiting for the moment when it went to full art and then back to non-full art because Wizards is toying with our emotions but I'm ok with this. Carry on, my friend.
Uhmmm I can't pause the gif.
Nostalgia overload
I started during ice age and really stop around oddesy. Blue green madness was scene.

It freaked me out that there were only a small part of the gif. Crazy
Hypnotizing.
Been a while since I bought a new pack but didn't they get rid of the text boxes on mana?
I just recently came back to magic after not having played for around 15 years and Im still so impressed with the art work of the cards. Its so impressive how WotC keeps pumping out great art work in every edition.
Phyrexia bringing that nostalgia..
>  Rise of the Eldrazi 

*fuck it, bipyramids everywhere*
Succession
can we get one of those "every frame of a movie" pictures for the five basic land types?
SHOUT OUT TO **MIN YUM**
Tempest. Years on, any time I'd stock plain land, I'd stock Tempest lands. Artist Douglas Shuler just did it for me. 
Why don't they make all basic lands full art now?
All my forests are revised to ice age... my cards are here somewhere 
Innistrad had good looking forests. 
I wish I could find a larger digital versions of the artwork on those cards.
This is awesome. If you do feel like doing more.....swamps or we riot while stabbing ourselves. 
I always liked the old design because it looked like you had a window into the world. Then new one doesn't look like that so much. I guess the new-new design captures the feel a bit better since the transition between the image and the text and the frame is better.
Super cool. Nice job =D
Awesome
O man that brought back a lot of memories from some good times. Thank you whoever made this.  
Come closer and see
I thought you would add Forest Gump in there as a joke :(
I can’t believe you’ve done this
The artwork is really what made me fall in love with this game as a kid back in the 90s. 
You're forgetting a few pictures but I'll let it slide :)
Wow w wreally brings out how much we need full art lands
now do it with the Islands and we've got a deal!
I play all of them on Turn 1.
Beautiful animation, beautiful artwork.
I play red ! ;)
Awesome, thx !
If I could ever get full art kamigawa lands I could die happy
So cool
I love this! I hope to see more! You started with the best. 
Love this! Do mountains next!
LOVE
This is both amazing and makes my eyes so wobbly I nearly seizure. 


Best looking land cards!
i’d love to see a slow version of this for all basics from euro and apac. 
This is amazing. I'd love this done with other lands. Mountains maybe? The Arabian Nights one can show up twice.
Now set it to The Cure. ;)
This is awesome!  Makes me think it would be cool to be a Planeswalker and see different worlds where something as simple as a tree will vary in so many ways. 
[A Meme](https://gifsound.com/?gif=https://i.redd.it/lwqxxdyok1uz.gif&v=7ou6MoKmxFQ&s=38).

(Sorry, I had to...)
0/10 no white borders.
Please add the Euro Lands / APAC / Portal for the other ones :-)
That's the best thing I ever saw.
Has no one put this here yet? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL_nrQxU-wE
Took a minute for the gif to start rolling and I genuinely believed a basic forest had 10k upvotes
Top 3 post of all time in one day, great job OP!
also shows B forest and C forest
Awesome!
This is awesome.
Has magic created more art than any other medium in the world? 
No unhinged art? Come on man!
This *really* shouldn't be a gif.

Sure, the limited colour palette makes it *possible* to compress all forests into 256 colours, but that doesn't mean you should. Especially since the palette seems to have been based on the first few images (although there do strangely seem to be some per-frame palettes, but maybe my eyes are wonky), so it just ends up getting increasingly worse as things go on.

Nothing against you personally, it's a really neat idea. But please, please upload it in a format that actually does justice to the art. (For example, Imgur and Gfycat both let you upload videos and we've all tacitly decided to pretend they're gifs.)

It all sounds incredibly pedantic and condescending, I know. But at this point I really can't find it in myself to put "please use a modern format instead of 9 megabytes of one from the 80's" any more nicely.
Hahaha is this what we're doing for upvotes now?
You missed the full arts

Big news in the TCG community: A Hearthstone pro from Hong Kong was just banned from tournament play and had his winnings revoked for using his winner's interview to speak out about Chinese oppression in HK. As MTG grows in China, we should push Wizards to commit that they won't do the same.
If you're not aware of Blizzard's incredibly draconian action against its own champion player, [a decent summary is here](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/08/hearthstone-pro-calls-for-hong-kong-liberation-during-live-blizzard-interview). This is not a theoretical issue w/ Wizards: For those who aren't aware, major MTG pro Lee Shi Tian is from Hong Kong, joined Hong Kong's previous Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, and [named a winning Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir deck 'Umbrella Revolution' in honor of the protests](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/adriennereynolds-101714-whats-in-a-name-lee-shi-tian-and-the-umbrella-revolution); WotC refused to use that deck name in their coverage of the Pro Tour, but Lee Shi Tian was also not punished by Wizards in any way as far as I'm aware.

Flash forwards to 2019, five years later -- China is a more important market than ever before (as evidenced by the Global Series decks aimed at growing the game there), and Hong Kong is once again fighting for its freedom. If Lee Shi Tian or another Hong Kong pro makes a similar principled stand now, and the Chinese government threatens to ban MTG from China in response... what would Wizards do?

It's a fair question to ask Wizards, it's a real-world issue and not an abstract hypothetical as evidenced by the Hearthstone situation, and it's fair for us as players and fans to request an answer.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, stranger! Edit: And the silvers!  


Edit: Obviously this is subtle and not explicit, and so open to interpretation, but [I think WotC is hearing us](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/dgba7y/wotc_showcasing_lee_shi_tian_on_instagram/)! Wouldn't be shocked if Lee and WotC have had some conversations behind the scenes about exactly how they both want to play this.
This is the thread for this topic, and we'll leave it on the front page for a while. Please don't make hundreds of others; we'll just remove them and send you here.

Also, rounding up Magic-related stuff on this...

* [Brian Kibler's response](http://bmkgaming.com/statement-on-blitzchung/) (spoiler: he's pulling out of Hearthstone commentary)
There’s no way Hasbro would allow a child-company to stand alongside protest, when they would risk hurting their relations with the absolutely massive Chinese toy market.
blitzchung knew exactly what the punishment for this was going to be, which is why he did it. By throwing himself on the sword and burning that $3k, his message is going viral and getting way more media traction than it would have otherwise. He's putting his beliefs before his career by using Blizzard's rules against them, it's kinda badass.
> For those who aren't aware, major MTG pro Lee Shi Tian is from Hong Kong, joined Hong Kong's previous Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, and named a winning Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir deck 'Umbrella Revolution' in honor of the protests; **WotC refused to use that deck name in their coverage of the Pro Tour**, but Lee Shi Tian was also not punished by Wizards in any way as far as I'm aware.

I want to address the highlighed portion in this quote. Does Wizards ever use the deck name submitted by the player in coverage? I don't think there is any evidence that they do. My understanding is that they use a standardized naming convention for decks, regardless of what players call them on the registration form.

Here is the official Wizards article listing the Top 8 decks of Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir: https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/top-8-decklists-2014-10-11

The decks are all listed using generic names, such as "Jeskai Wins" and "Abzan Midrange." I doubt very much that three different pros submitted their deck registration lists with the deck named "Jeskai Wins" (a particularly uncreative name).

Conversely, here is the Top 8 profile article, which contains actual quotes from interviews by the players: https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/top-8-player-profiles-2014-10-12

Lee Shi Tian is openly cited talking about the political situation in Hong Kong in this article:

> **What Constructed deck are you playing and why?** Umbrella Revolution. The deck was made during the protests, mainly by theory. 100% made from Hong Kong.

and

> **What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** Telling Hong Kongers the dream is worth fighting for. No matter how hard it is.

I don't think there is any evidence that Wizards engaged in any sort of censorship in the coverage of this event.
Pretty sure Lee has spoken out on Twitter about it.
Wizards consistently refer to Taiwan as Chinese Taipei.

I wouldn't hold my breath.
This topic just now slowly rears its ugly head in gaming culture. Imagine how deep the roots have grown in all of our industries and how much of that was already happening on a much bigger scale but with less media coverage in different areas? The Chinese government is the big bully in the room now. You can't critique them, you can't even mention any protesting against them and people just quietly accept it because money. It's frightening.

I have some very close friends who live in Hong Kong, and have grown at home with the community there. Though I am an american, I have done MTG nearly every other set since Antiquities and could easily call myself a whale. The minute Wizards does anything major to appease the bloodthirsty monster that is the CCP, I will permanently boycott their products and sell every card I have.

I've lost contact with a few of my dearest friends. I don't know if I'll ever see them again.
What Blizzard did is unacceptable, and if you actually care you'll cancel your WoW subscriptions, and delete Hearthstone until they take any action that resembles having a backbone
[deleted]
Think this is an important wake up call for people who seem to believe companies are on their side with the recent woke trend.  
They are not your friends, they are a for profit company who will do anything to maximize their profit. They will pretend to share your values in the west but wil support tyrants in the East
I love both these games and am walking away hearthstone because they have taken actions that support human rights abuse.  I will walk away from MTG as well, or any company that places corporate greed above basic human liberty.
Lee was allowed to talk about his activism and protesting during his  HoF acceptance speech, and until now wasnt reprimanded for his continued outspokeness.

Lets hope it stays this way.
WOTC may not wish to sway to China's whim but Hasbro has proven that they don't mind pissing people off for a few bucks.
This is an excellent point.
If WotC decides to punish players for being pro-Hong Kong, then as much as I love this game I will be quitting.
Wizards gotta make those big yuans, know what i’m saying? Not like they printed duel decks aimed specifically at a mainland chinese audience, right?
Hasbro and Wotc should do the RIGHT thing and not the profitable thing, and support those protesting Chinese aggression in HK. But they won't because they clearly only want our money, not our respect.
Just cancelled my WoW Classic subscription citing this as the reason why.
I hope they will keep a backbone, but they won't
We can try but I am not expecting an answer.

I would imagine that they are not going to commit one way or another, they will probably stay silent about it, it's the safest move for them.
Deleted the Blizzard app and won't be playing their games going forward. Punishing players for expressing political beliefs is unacceptable, undermines the legitimacy of the game, and is an affront to free speech.
I mean, I'd be dumbfounded if we got any kind of information in advance of such an action being taken. Even if WotC decides that they'd do nothing if a player did something similar on an official broadcast, they wouldn't announce that in advance.

Forcing a company to take a stand on these kinds of issues can definitely be an effective form of activism, but I'll also point out that it doesn't make a ton of sense to demand WotC do so while ignoring every other company you purchase things from who does the same.
I mean Lee Shi Tian was been pretty open, and while Wizard's handling of it hasn't been perfect, they've done Okay
BDM is no longer a part of the coverage team, but it would great if MPL players were given a platform to speak:

[https://twitter.com/Top8Games/status/1181546159434797056](https://twitter.com/Top8Games/status/1181546159434797056)
It’s ridiculous and we should pressure them, but I’m not sure how. Without our pressure, they won’t make a statement. They’ll side with the authoritarian government because money means more than principle and freedom I guess
This. This is using your platform to stand for something. Bra fucking vo my dude.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Huge respect for this dude.
I first met Blizzard in 1992 with the Lost Vikings. I got to know Blizzard better in 1994 with Blackthorne. I lived through both Warcrafts and expansions, both Starcrafts, the launch of WoW, etc. Blizzard and I go way back. 


Supporting human rights is more important than money, profit or a game.


Blizzard is dead to me.
Well, I'll never play Hearthstone again.
Lmao another dreamer. Wizards wont do anything unless it will bring them profit. And dealing with potential limitations on huge chinese market wont make any.
This is an important moment because it sets a precedent on how western game companies deal with getting controlled by china and what their customers let them get away with. 

I don't blame individuals who aren't willing to risk their jobs for human rights but I have tremendous respect for those who put the truth and what is right first even if it means potential personal consequences.

While the Blizzard case is most visible example this shit runs deep and it's important to know where different companies stand. Riot games for example doesn't allow their casters to call a team that is competing in league of legends world championship(Hong Kong Attitude) by it's real name.
I’ll be canceling my wow sub. Gross.
Sadly, WOTC/Hasbro, like other big companies, will succumb to the authoritative Chinese market. They already use the "Chinese Taipei" designation, and made a special product for the region.
Not that I don't support this issue, but do you really think that even if this issue blows up on all of WotC's social media, that they'll answer a subject this touchy for no gain, considering it has nothing to do with them to begin with? Or rather, even if they do answer it and say they'd never do such a thing, would people even accept that? This subreddit's wariness and distrust of WotC borders on conspiracy-theory levels sometimes.

That said, wouldn't be surprised if this thread gets taken down by the mods. Not because of evil censorship, but because I'm pretty sure it goes against subreddit rules. "Politics in modicum" is one thing, but I'm not sure this'll count as magic related content. It only is because you're framing it as a letter to Wotc, but as I said above, I'm not sure thats enough.
I hope Wizards (Hasbro) doesn't punish players like Blizzard did/does for speaking against the Chinese government. I've already put in a ticket to permanently delete my 15+ year old Blizzard account due to this whole fiasco, and I'd hate to lose out on more games due to the Chinese government's insistent demands that people heel to their nonsensical censoring and totalitarian ideology.
To be fair I think they just rename all the decks to unfun names, not just the political ones. There used to be decks with good names - TRIX, Stax, Miracle Gro, Raffinity, Dead Guy Ale, The Rock, Sligh, Freshmaker, Team America, Caw Blade. They wanted to eliminate jargon naming, and make everything understandable for new players - thus eliminating creative naming conventions for descriptive text - Esper Hero, Esper Stax, Jund, Golgari dreadhorde, **Mardu Control**, etc.

Fish used to mean efficient creatures in aggro control decks. Which happened to be merfolk. Now it just means merfolk. Mono blue last season could be seen as a fish deck. Current UG decks could be seen as fish decks, or gro decks. Instead its called simic flash.

Interestingly Dredge and Hogaak have created fun names for replicating playstyle  - {Whatever colors} Trollgaak for [Feasting Troll King]

Anyway I'd love to see a push for transparency, and a return of letting players decks have good names with newbie friendly descriptors.
Yeah, make MTG print skeletons again!
boycotting blizzard now :<
I canceled both my WoW subscription and my Warcraft III Reforged pre-order over this.  This is genuinely not okay.
Game company, regardless of which one, can’t risk losing China. China has 3x people online than the US. I don’t like the things happening in HK but China is too hard to access and too good to risk losing. It’s horrible facts but that’s the truth. Money talks.
A game called Gods Unchained will be paying the prize money that was pulled. I think this is interesting, and a neat way for them to take advantage of the sotuation for some marketing. I realize I'm doing their job for them, but I might at least check out the game as a result, so its definitely worked for me. 

I'll still prefer playing in paper though. I didn't play HS and don't play MTGA already, so I don't think I'll stick with any other digital card game.
Free Hong Kong!
For those interested, the guy DID get his winnings. The company who I assume was actually running the tournament (idk I don't fallow hearthstone) stepped up and was happy to take that massive PR gap left by blizzard. They paid out his winnings AND refunded his entry fee.

https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304

Edit: it's a rival game company, not the to's.
Hasbo won't commit to anything that prevents them of selling stuff in China, or have their factories be closed down by the Chinese government. Any MTG player speaking up against China and the Hong Kong issue will be promptly banned.
Cancelled my WoW Classic sub and will be giving that monthly cash to MTG Arena instead. Wizards did the right thing in not naming the deck, while also not punishing the player. That's how a company who doesn't wish to get involved with issues like Hong Kong should do it.
I unsubbed from Classic WoW because of this.
I'm not surprised they pulled this, just disappointed.
The only question I have is whether Blizzard treats people wanting to voice their concern with oppression by other imperialist countries in the same way that they treat this HS player.

I think with Wizards being interested in both the US and the Chinese markets, I do not have to fear  unequal treatment at least for these two empires.
They won't because money 

Oh sure they'll speak to concerns and gone floundering non-specific critiques in non-official outlets, but the Hasbro owned WotC is governed by capitalist demands to seize as much money at any cost. They'll only take action against such things of the user base materially affects their income in a substantial way, which outcry from their player base probably won't be substantial enough to accomplish.
Theres not a snowballs chance in hell Hasbro will take a stance. They're a toy company for kids. Additionally all their other cheap plastic shit is more than likely made in China.
Wizards alters art of skeletons in accordance with Chinese law at least as far back as original Ravnica, and wont show queer relationships in card art or flavor text because of China and Russia.  


They've been letting foreign governments guide their policy for a while.
Good for him. Fuck Blizzard!
I appreciate you bringing this attention. Gamers are in such a strange position. I studied political science in college and it's interesting how much breaks down to game theory. We are low key experts on politics or at least have a ton of experience to learn from, yet I feel we shy a way from that, especially because I'm sure gaming is an escape for so many of us. Yet now gamers have to deal with microtransactions and how money has molded gaming in general. I'm looking at the social layer, but with the little I understand about Hong Kong, there is a technology aspect too. 

I have a lot of hope that gamers will be a integral part of the evolution to come in society. I consider myself a leftist/radical/chaotic good type. I say this because as you all know we don't want one type of player on our team. I hope to see new ideas and new strategies. At the end of the day, I want something balanced.
I would think that Wizards itself would be staunchly in support of Hong Kong, but Hasbro might have a different stance that could supercede what Wizards actually wants to do. That said, we should mount maximum pressure to make sure that Wizards is on the right side of this. Wizards covers my other 2 big nerd hobbies D&D and Magic, Blizzard already fucked up I don’t want WOTC to be next.
hey y'all, just be glad that this sub's moderators are cool with having the discussion. About 5 hours ago I made a similiar post on the MTG Arena subreddit -- and I didn't even ask WOTC or Hasbro to take a stand, I merely raised the question of "what is your stance on China?"

My post was taken down mere minutes later. Supposedly because it violated a rule that posts should only talk about "MTG cards, decks, sets, upcoming sets" etc.  They didn't even include a link to y'all's thread, I found it on my own
that's fucked!
If WOTC did that shit, I can't really change what id do because I've already pretty much boycotted giving them money for other reasons. But in this case I would start making a ruckus and telling other people to do what I do.
Wizards/Hasbro have already shown themselves to be beholden to the Chinese: when have you ever heard the word "Taiwan" uttered on MtG coverage? I can remember one time, and afterwards you could audibly hear Helen Bergeot say "Oh shit!" from off camera.
I am never touching Blizzard products again after this. I will not touch Wizards products again if they do this. I've been playing Magic for 25 years.
Well, due to this debacle, I am putting Blizzard as the 2nd company on my ban list. EA is the first company I lodged in that list ever since sim city debacle and I have never ever touched any of their games ever since.
That is just terrible. It appears that Blizzard doenst care about free speech at all.
Honestly I think the main issue is that these companies don't want their platform used to discuss politics. I doubt they'd have a problem with players having strong opinions, but when they try to express them on coverage or via deck names then that's a no go. It'd be similar to naming your deck "Vote Trump" in the run-up to next year's election. Companies don't want personal politics associated with them so won't be having casters read out "vote trump" on stream.
Seriously, fuck all these companies who clearly show money is more important than moral standards. Will we just keep letting China be China so we can do business at the cost of the freedom we have fought and died for? Just so share price can go up? Disgusting.
Mods, sticky this post?
As a Chinese MTG website editor, i didnt see MTG grows in China lol
Cancelled my WoW subscription and leaving my long time HS account, so anyone have advice to Learn how to play Magic. Was around since Beta for HS and got to see all new cards as they were added, tried to play a bit of Arena and I dont know where to start!
If Wizards ever does this shit I will never give the company money for their dumb paper cards ever again
Yeah like wizards can stand up to China like Blizzard and the NBA couldn't
See, this is the thing with brands. They’ll tell you they’re on your side, Wizards will march in pride and talk about how important diversity is, but the bottom line is they’re less committed to those ideals than they are to money and the China situation puts that in stark contrast.

Like, Wizards has a fair few LGBT characters in their game, but the cards only give the subtlest indication of that, you have to find about it in the books or whatever. That’s because of China. But they still march in the pride parade here because they’re with us to the extent that it doesn’t hurt their bottom line. 

The toning down of the cheesecake art is another thing, Liliana’s dresses didn’t get less revealing because Wizards wants to be more socially responsible in the US, it’s because of strict right-wing censors in China.

It’s only going to get worse as China becomes a stronger global power.
Already uninstalled the game, it's Arena only now. Good luck and good topdecks HK
Yeah, if you ask me there's no way Wizards will allow such a thing either. Given their recent tactics it really seems they're trying to squeeze every last penny out of their players, so I don't think they'll risk a market as large as China, even if it might be the morally right thing.
Oh you sweet summer child...Wizards has been pandering to China since ever.
Here's my prediction, which I would love to be wrong about:  
Hasbro will not allow WotC to answer the question. They will do and say nothing, if at all possible. If forced to speak or act, they will side with the totalitarian regime that controls access to the world's largest consumer market and the place all their factories are located.
My mind is fuzzy on the details (both of the event and geopolitically). A while back didn't someone do really well with a brew at an SCG, but they made him change the name of it before they'd do a deck tech or show its name on stream since it was a reference to the HK umbrella movement?
If WoTC ever even hints at doing anything similar. I will give up Magic in a heartbeat. No drafts, no pre release, no more introducing friends and family. Blizzard's actions are beyond unacceptable, I don't play Blizzard games anymore but will be uninstalling Battle.NET.
See how the NBA is handling the recent backlash from china related comments. No way Wotc or Hasbro do anything to upset china
I couldn’t agree more. If we stand by while the Chinese government coerces U.S. companies into silencing criticism, we’ll be dealing with the consequences for the rest of our lives.

I like Magic, but I can live without it (and my wallet would thank me for it). If Wizards ever buckles here, I’ll walk away forever.
Please wotc, we know pr is npt your strong suit. You cant fuck this up. You just cant. Theres gonna ve opportunities to fuck it up and we very badly need you not to fuck it up.
I wonder where all the toys Hasbro sells are made?  The commentators did not deserve this.
Ok ok.
It just seems like blizzard wanted to stay out of politics on there stream, that doesn't seem like a huge deal.

Am I crazy or am I just missing something?
It would be nice if a corporation put human rights before profits for once but it's not likely to happen
I imagine China forced them to make the call. I for one don't believe companies should be forced to get involved.
I deleted my 15-year old Blizzard account over this. If Wizards does something like this... well idk really. Maybe I'll sell my collection and get proxies.
Thank you, Blitzchung, and thank you, Lee Shi Tang. Give no ground to these oppressors.
Same thing with the NBA. I'm not about to take sides, but censorship is never okay.
we can ask, but it's not really up to Wizards, it's up to Hasbro, and they probably won't care
Wizards will censor you because the Chinese market is huge. The video game and movie industry as well as social media companies are invoking Chinese levels of censorship on American consumers so they can do business in China
Let's hope for the best. However, I fear that pressure from Hasbro would force WoTC to do the same. I don't condone the execution of innocent citizens like in June 4 1989 so I hope that mainland China doesn't take it further than the ridiculous lengths they've already taken things.
There is absolutely zero chance WotC takes any sort of moral high ground with China because it's a huge market and $ trumps ideology every single time.

WotC is also an American company, the country which bombs schools and hospitals whilst celebrating war criminals. It's the same shit, just with better media/PR spin.
Never going to happen. Companies only care about money. China makes them money, so they will do what china says.
Sorry to break it to you but wizards would 100% do this in a heart beat
Yes
What the fuck, that’s horrible!
Thing is, I'd totally expect them to do something like this, especially with China's huge but politically sensitive market. They'd probably try to be quieter and sure lots of Wizards staff would probably disagree but the Hasbro suits I'm sure would do it.
Former art director of MtG, 2 years ago.

This statement would have been in relation to Nexus of Fate or Firesong and Sunspeaker, correct?
The slow blade penetrates the shield.
That is a very telling statement about the current state of the decisions being made at Wizards of the Coast.

I hope things change, but I've got other hobbies if it doesn't.  I'm pretty disappointed overall with Magic as a whole, and it's one thing after another right now.

It seems like what was once seen as a desperate money grab when they were out of ideas is now the driving philosophy.
The grasping suits have totally taken over.
Jesper is not just an art director. He designed the card back.
Wow, talk about being relevant, and from a rather important WotC ex-employee no less.

I mean, it's obvious to everyone anyways, but it's always nice to hear it confirmed from "the other side"
I keep seeing this common theme of talented and insightful people vocalizing legitimate concerns which are then immediately ignored (both in Magic and elsewhere). 

Jesper knew then, MaRo knows now (and probably knew then, too), yet here we are.
Oof. And it was only 2 years ago. Imagine in 2 years how far they can go. Scary thoughts ...
Every single-faced Magic card in your collection features a design by Jesper. The card back.
All the recent questionable business decisions, disrespect toward players and destruction of what's left of the lore contribute in making me increasingly disinterested with the game.

This, however, is making me enormously nostalgic and realize how much more "fun" the game used to be. Maybe things were just simpler back then...
Jesper Myrfors is a straight up bro. He's been commenting on WotC's actions for the last few years with the kind of insight you could only get from someone who was on the ground floor at day one. He's extremely personable, too. I exchange comments with him regularly on Facebook.
Do we need to say more, WOTCs response to situation will 100% decide if I continue to play Magic or not.

While I love this game and it's been a big part of my life there are so many other companies that will gladly take my money every week on a regular basis. To think I can't replace this in my life with other board games, card games or video games is just short sighted.

We are in an age of an abundance of entertainment and limited time and funds, I don't know if burning your player base for a short term gain is the right move.
They knew it, was even back then. They knew the possibility and the outcome.
Can someone please ELI5 what is going on with these Walk-ins Dead cards that has everyone so upset?
This is kinda depressing, but at the same time it makes me hope they change something about the way they will handle this secret lair. Every mtg player needs to see this.
This is the problem with publicly traded companies.  The shareholders are never satisfied with steady, reliable profits or even reasonable growth.   They want immediate, beat-the-market growth, year over year.   Magic can't build the player base 15-20% annually, every single year (correct me if wrong), therefore the amount spent per player needs to increase or profit margin needs to increase (cut costs) in order to appease the shareholders.
Watching this game slowly die is sad   : (
Jesper - my favorite mtg artist of all time and an all around good dude.
I think I am more shocked they go for TWD secret lair nonsense before breaking the reserved list. Absolutely ass backwards.
Jesper is one of the "founding fathers" of Magic to me, so I would LOVE to hear what he thinks about the current situations and discussions - although I suspect, and hope, it'd echo his statement here  
  
@jesper maybe /u/jespermyrfors perhaps?
Engrave this in stone and place it outside Hasbro headquarter.
HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.
The [proper link](https://www.facebook.com/jesper.myrfors/posts/10210692947514523) instead of the poor screenshot.
Can we all each share this on maro’s socials please
Holy shit, damn..
Have to say I’ve been disenchanted with Mtg product for a good while now. Which is evidenced by me not spending any money on it in well over a year.

Luckily all I play is commander with a small group of friends who feel the same way. So this doesn’t really affect us all that much. But I do feel bad for the way standard has been shaping up basically since the mass ban waves that started with Kaladesh.

Wizards needs to get their shit together, and fast. It feels bad saying this, but I in good faith could not recommend that someone get into Magic right now.
Sounds like some new Silicon Valley type joined and it all went more the $$$$ and whale route, everything else be damned.

3.7k upvotes but don’t take a shot at MaRo anybody, he is blameless /s
Yup I remember thus quote and it's so very true. It's why I've mostly stepped back from Magic and only play commander / the occasional fnm rather than going every week and maintaining several different decks.
I'm pretty sure it's a fundamental law of physics that all good things get ruined eventually. MtG had a good run.
This was my hint to take a break from magic. We still play, but I've got 12 edh decks, I'm good.

No need to buy these cards for me, have fun with them if you like them.
I mean if they want money....*side eyes reserved list*
This is why I don't play anymore. Every couple months they release a new set that makes the one before instantly obsolete. If you want to stay competitive, good luck having money left. It's disgusting and predatory, and for me, it just isn't fun anymore.
The part of about it taking advantage of people with mental disorders is solidly true. Magic is a great game in terms of letting people express themselves with cards that are powerful, artistic and make people feel smart. I have a lot of people on the spectrum or with mental illnesses/disorders that use the game as an outlet and are drawn to it. Sometimes people with those issues can be obsessive and if you release something at absurd prices they are inclined to buy it, basically just finding away to take more from them and get less in return. It also shows a startling large lack of creativity on behalf of the game designers and really turns me away from playing. When my gamestore starts back up in person games in the future I don't know if I will go because of this current stuff going on.
He’s not wrong.
Can we wind the game back to 2012, please? ;-;
Jesper Myrfors is a treasure.  If you ever get a chance to talk to him at a large tournament, take it.
I firmly believe that Hasbro is calling these shots. I also believe that Wizards of the Coast's employees (Rosewater, Gavin, etc.) are  finding the best ways to keep their jobs and blunt the effects of Hasbros money grabbing. Many people are quick to blame them for mistakes like Nexus of Fate and TWD and not banning new cards. But everytime something like that happens, you see them playing spin doctor. They can't just say no to Hasbro because Hasbro would replace them in a second with someone who won't give a shit about this game. Some nameless aashole who will only follow orders and cut out the ones who refuse. So get off your high horses people. You couldn't do this job any better. So be thankful there are people who give a shit about the players of this card game. We will be the death of this game if we don't stand together. That is all.
\[\[Nexus of fate\]\] is released at  2018-07-13.
Every week I become less interested in the game. I used to play weekly if not more than once a week and now I've probably played less than 20 events over the past two years. It sucks and covid has nearly wiped tabletop game stores out where I live. Only one LGS left in my city and there were four here a couple years ago.
Pokémon is handling something like this better then Magic. Sure there’s the lack of good cards in booster boxes, but rare cards can be acquired pretty easily. I got a full art from something at Costco. The most they do with collector boosters are the collector sets, such as Champion’s path or Hidden fates, but generally, when something like a fetchland comes up, they’ll put it in a deckbuilder’s toolkit.

The only thing they don’t have is sets specifically for expanded, and draft.
Jesper's art work for those who aren't familiar: 
https://scryfall.com/search?q=artist%3Amyrfors&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name

I just noticed his last name and I'm wondering if Myr named after Jesper??
The mental health aspect is disgusting
While a statement in regards to the BaBs I'm sure, it still rings true to today. A heinous practice of predatory capitalism.
Holy. S***.
The key operative term people seem to be missing here is "former".

People who shared their mindset will have been pushed out, or reformed their opinions by now. 

Chase premiums are the future direction of MtG, regardless of what fans and former art directors have to say about it.
Magic IS the walking dead.
I stopped mtg cold turkey because I was addicted. I wanted the best cards for the best decks and would spend like $400 for a standard deck no problem. I realized that I couldn't buy responsibly and so I quit around kaladesh. I think that the game has always been a lottery in some sense, but the odds of winning now are dwindling as more sets are released. Limited time products, buy a box promos, and $10 boosters for poor quality products are all great news for me because I know that i made the right choice to quit.
I havent bought a physical magic card in a year. I dont see myself buying any more arena packs. I think its time to unsub from all these subs. Maybe I'll sell out of legacy. Wow what a time.
Okay, this hurts pretty bad
Myrfors is a really cool dude and is part of the reason the original game was so artistically distinct.  One of his goals was to try and expand the game beyond the "standard" fantasy audience; but he did it by discouraging artists from falling into boring fantasy tropes or excessive chainmail bikini stuff - by finding new and interesting takes on fantasy and by giving the game its own distinct character, not by abandoning it.

The art direction since then has been the opposite.  Too much standardized fantasy stuff, combined with an obsessively narrow, formulaic concept of the genre.  This obsessive market-driven focus on the idea of their fanbase as 14-year-old boys (they relented on that eventually, but it was a major factor for like a decade.)  Desperately trying to go for MCU / DCEU-style teamups and an obsessive focus on personality / name-driven IP in planeswalkers rather than making magic something uniquely distinct.

It all feels so by the numbers nowadays.
"A wild Hasbro executive appears!"
Can we sticky this on every sub related to Mtg?
r/agedlikemilk
Glad i sold my stuff recently. Came back into the game AGAIN and came in around Ikoria and the Godzilla stuff. I had wanted to jump back in and went balls deep. Using profits from another hobby that i buy/sell/trade in i got back into it and honestly felt kinda disgusted with how they handle their customer service, product quality and most importantly the obscene money grab mentality they have its a super sad state for the game and as much as i want to justify playing the game,  i cant. With the greed and already complicated way of actually playing with people in person, i feel the Nostalgia and joy i once had for the game is slowly fleeting and will become something i fondly look back on like I do with other things i dont play with anymore. Like power rangers and other things of the like, for the 3rd and most likely final time i gotta walkaway. Good night sweet prince. You were once a magical place for many.
Why does everyone think wizards used to be so honorable? If they could’ve made these cards in the past they would have.
Yes, because it isn’t like the entire lottery aspect of the game (randomized packs with rarities) isn’t already taking advantage of people with certain mental disorders. 

It’s disingenuous to pretend the business model isn’t already predatory and we know it has been since the beginning. 

Magic preys on obsessive collectors and competitors with FOMO and that is fine. We accept this. Just don’t pretend it is a new thing. 

Let’s say we drop rocks off a busy highway. This is a bad idea. 
Now let’s say brian brings in larger rocks or a bowling ball. 
You can’t tell brian “woah now we don’t wanna do anything that will hurt anyone” when that os exactly what you are doing. 

This should have been expected. This is fine, it is all the product we all signed up for and supported for the last 27 years.

It is ok if we are greedy...just not cravenly greedy. 

We are all complicit and need to admit this.
I wish I had a good screenshot of Joe from Nostalgia Critics "Batman V Superman" review.

WOTC: Its EXACTLY what you want.... cmon now.

Us: *ahem* ........ NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hasbro-WotC is now the EA of tabletop games.
Proof that you can be an ethical for-profit business without being a greedy, money grubbing, immoral, unethical, soul crushing corporation.

&#x200B;

 It all started because of Hasbro.
“Chase” cards? (Cries in Heroclix)
You’ve become the very thing you swore to destroy!
... do I have a mental disorder?
Can i get a workers of the world unite?
I mean...WotC is currently Hasbro's moneymaking staple. And has been (on the average) for some time. While some IPs wax and wane, all WotC has been doing has been remaining consistent with Magic and D&D. 

D&D is now almost bigger than it was back in AD&D. It's definitely far more accessible and mainstream. And you have celebs playing and promoting it while other small time celebs have become big names as a result (CR). What's more, D&D even _partnered with CR_ and published an official sourcebook for their custom plane...

And now Magic is doing a D&D set (after fans clamoured for it for decades?) TBF, the last D&D card game was...embarrassing (Spellfire, anyone?)
Wow I never thought about the aspect of these kinds of products taking advantage of people with certain mental illness.  That really turns the walking dead secret lair from something I hate to something that just makes me really sad.
Interesting, though I would like to add that director of art probably has limited - no say on pretty much anything to do with the company.  Outside of the art of cards obviously.  


Not saying it isn't relevant...but not as relevant as say the managing director or someone with actual pull saying it.
Wotc has nothing to gain by being honest with us. The investors run the show now
Oh how the mighty have fallen
I miss when I loved magic the gathering
As Much pointed out on The Command Zone, they already have some this before and made chase cards. Mark Rosewater himself said the fans were extremely upset by it and they decided not to do it again.

One of those cards was Mana Crypt.
Can we please hard-upvote this and share it with the suits at Hasbro who dearly need to see it?
I would certainly qualify people that buy secret lairs as having "certain mental disorders"
[deleted]
I am a Hasbro shareholder and I don’t see the price of Hasbro stock going up as a result of these decisions. What gives??
There you go, he's basically admitting that the mtg community is filled with a lot of obsessive addicted  mental cases.
I’d argue they don’t benefit shareholders if they cause people to leave the game.
If they really wanted to benefit players, get rid of the reserved list.
Pretty harsh to say that TWD fans have a mental disorder but I get it
Really glad Star Wars Armada took over as my main game at the beginning of the year. With Clone Wars coming soon, it's the perfect time to get into the game.
I'd understand a pre-release effect of these cards.. Like a tie-in for an upcoming release and they are variants of a certain card, like Godzilla themed cards.. Maybe they will and that will save the day
Michonne seems pretty beastly, 6cmc for a 3/3, but summons two zombies, and gets indestructible and has a taunt mechanic, well.. There's an answer to it.. To all of em, the game won't break at tournaments if they allow it. *if* they allow it, certainly probably won't be without it being a reasonable overall chance of acquiring said card, and it isn't like that. So maybe this will be a lgs or house group card.. The card is what you make it, it can be just a card that is a promo of walking dead, and the flavors are cool; we won't see them in legal tournament play, but would be cool and fun to see in casual games.. Or it can be a card that illogically is allowed in tournament play and Player A has a set, Player B *would* have a set, but they were A) unreasonably expensive, or B) Sold out.. And given that's the case, he'd build with that Intel.. So, really I don't know.. Is it that big of a deal? All of this?
Aged like a fine milk.
What I want to know is what the meetings are like where executives who likely don’t understand the game very well tell the poor product directors (who probably took the job because they like magic, if we are being realistic) that they need to print broken cards, and then to give them a list of the best cards in the set so they can decide how and where they will be sold. Sounds egregious.
Magic cards going the way of the sports cards. Coming serial numbered cards, autographs, 1/1s and memorabilia.
People are mad at WotC, but they have almost nothing to do with this. It’s almost definitely a Hasbro thing.
The Negan card is pretty cool tho...
F
Does anyone have a link to where this comment was made?
So, do you all admit to having mental disorders now?
I mean, WotC's long term plan at this point is to phase out the paper game and produce only MTGA. They are going to milk every last drop from paper players that they can over the next couple years while they completely destroy the integrity of it. Then it will cease production due to lack of demand and all efforts can be put towards milking the online cash cow they have going.

This makes perfect sense from a short term perspective. The people making these decisions only plan to be with the company for a few more years anyways. They're trying to pump the stock up so they can sell it at an all time high and then retire. Who cares what that does to the game 5 or 10 years from now.
Big reason why I stopped spending money on cards. Just feels like manual dlc.
More than 2 years ago.
My 25 year old son recently passed away, he was an avid Magic player. His uncle made a Magic card to give away at his "Celebration of Life" which was held yesterday.

I remember this fellow frequently playing at my LGS for quite a while and this really hit me hard when I learned of this news.  He will be sorely missed and my condolences to his family. Magic Stronghold Games won't be the same without him. =(
Joel was our Raid Leader on WoW, <Perfidia> on Mal'Ganis-US Horde. The amount of sadness our guild felt when we heard of his passing was immeasurable. He will always be Tristtania to us and we will never forget his loving and kind heart.

This is a beautiful tribute and I wish your family my deepest condolences.

<3 Veil
Oh my god, I know Joel. We were co-ops together at EA.

The Vancouver Magic scene won't be the same. So sorry for your loss.
That's a really nice tribute.  Sorry for your loss.

I'd play that as a 4 of btw.
We have been told that the red dots in the top right corner should be white. He had 240 cards printed.
Whoever designed that did a great job, really cool Planeswalker concept! Sorry for your loss.
Oh my god.
I played one of my favourite matches of Magic against this guy and i didn't even know his name.
I am so sorry for your loss - my limited experience with your son was overwhelmingly positive, he was quick to laugh and a pleasure to have as an opponent.
The Vancouver Magic Scene has suffered a serious loss. 
:(
I am the youngest brother of the three. I made a post in the eu4 subreddit a while back. Here is the [link] (https://m.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4f286b/my_older_brother_passed_away_2_days_ago_he_was/)
Could someone transcribe the card text for us with lo-res mobile?
Flavor text if I may be so bold:

"From the moment he stepped into existence he was destined to do great things. He mustered legions and conquered countless skilled commanders. Phyrexia feared him. The Eldrazi worshipped him. He bent and shaped the very Æther to his will. Now he is at peace, resting. One with the Multiverse."

Edit: Thank you for the gold, wonderful human. 😊
This was a very beautiful idea. Upvote and a save. Best wishes to the family. 
Is there a way to get a copy of these cards? I would love to keep their love for magic alive by creating a deck for it.
As part of the magic community I send my condolences and hate to hear we lose one of our own. If possible I would like to purchase a copy of his card to help with the cost of his funeral and to keep a part of him alive whenever I go to a gp or play at my lgs 
Sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss. That's a keeper card to remember him by for his friends, and will spark many a 'Remember when' story. :)

Definitely will be legal in all formats for his friends. :)  Kudos to your brother or brother in law!
My 22 year old daughter recently passed, I am so sorry for your loss and hope that the good times spent with him are overwhelming.
My condolences. I'm a 25 year old man and I feel like I got my reminder that life should not be taken for granted. 
Damn :(

The name seemed familiar, and I see I played against him at One Stop Shop (downtown Vancouver) back in 2009.

Very nice tribute
No father should out live his son.  Im sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss. The card is really cool, I'll take a foil any time. 
Beautiful way to remember him. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family.
That is so incredibly beautiful. 
I'm truly sorry for your loss, and to all friends and family.
He's not gone; he just traveled to a different Plane. 
There is an empty chair,

at the table this day.

A hallowed place where,

a friend once played.

The roll of his dice,

my ears long to hear.

Or perhaps it would suffice,

if he should suddenly appear.

With deck of cards in hand,

and a bag of Weed to share.

All his friends would stand,

as he sat in the empty chair.

I hear his voice a-callin’,

and it ties my heart in a knot.

For he cries, “Though a comrade has fallen,

You must play for those who cannot.”

We conquered worlds on the run,

he and I in the name of fun.

And as others may come and go,

I make both both friend and foe.

But what I long for most,

is our past now long a ghost.

* I lost my best friend and gaming pal a few years back, and someone showed me this poem.  Knowing Jon, he's already made his introduction to Joel, and told him his life story.  Jon always knew how to welcome new players to the fold. 

EDIT: this is called Eulogy for a Gamer and can be found at kenzerco.com.  The original has "Cheeze-Doodle" and not "Weed", but that's how it was first shown to me.
Rest in peace Joel. Watch over Dominaria for the rest of us yet to cross over.
As a magic player, I would love to be remembered this way. I would also be so touched that my family would choose to immortalize me in a way that was significant to me. It shows such a deep love and understanding. I didn't know your son, but I don't think it's a stretch to assume that he would have felt the same way.
Woah, I don't play nor know much at all about the games concept but this is an amazing tribute and exceptionally quality print. Very touching and so sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry to hear about your loss. :( This is a great tribute.
Sorry for your loss. This is an incredible way to remember him, and I'm sure he's enjoying it greatly wherever he is. Condoleances from Sweden.
I don't play Magic.  I only want to offer my condolences.  I lost my little brother recently, and my parents have to correct themselves periodically and acknowledge me as the youngest now.  I can't imagine what it really must be like for my parents, just as I can't imagine what is is like for you.  My heart goes out to you. 
my condolences. this is very sad but lore wise an amazing way to memorize him
Those Alpha cuts though.

I'm so sorry.  That's a beautiful tribute.
Ow, my heart! 


I have no words;  I'm so sorry.
That's tear jerkingly sweet. That card represents a whole lot. My heart goes out to his friends and family.

On a lighter note though, of that was an actual printed card, I'd hunt it. Those abilities are control deck GOLD.
I know I'll just be another voice in the crowd, but I would like to express my sincerest condolences to you and your family. This tribute is extremely touching and beautiful. I wish you strength in this time of hardship. 
I have no idea what 90% of words in this comments section mean. My youngest bro plays WOW and Magic and I never got why. Well now I do what an amazing strong and caring community. Good on you all.
Sorry for your loss mate, your son seemed to have dealt with some great people, I'm sure thats a reflection on the person he was. 
I was just playing Overwatch with his brother. Funny I should learn about this here. My condolences to you all.
I know nothing about Magic but this came up on /r/all and I just wanted to express my condolences for your loss.
Your son is OP. I'm sorry for your loss.
I only played a match or two with Joel years ago but he was a memorable and kind person. I am sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss, but, what a fantastic way for everyone to remember your son.
How did he pass?
Sorry for your loss, lots of strength to you and your family! :(
It would be really cool if Wizards honored this young man with a card.
Oh this is so bittersweet, sorry for your loss OP.
So sorry for your loss OP, all the best in the future!
Sorry for your loss. This card is well done and hopefully does a good job as a representation of your son as a player. 
I used to really enjoy this game too.  Terrible news about your son, God bless you and your family in these times
Long-time MtG player, with an 11 year old son I may try and get interested soon. My sincere condolences on your loss. Based on numerous comments here, he sounds like he was a good guy.
That card is awesome.  What a great idea. I would be proud if someone did this for me. 
May his draws be strong and Spells forever cast on curve...
Very sorry.

This was a nice idea.
This is very touching. I wish you and your family the best.
Sorry for your loss, very nice Idea.
The tribute card is a very cool idea. I hope it sparks years of conversation and remembrance amongst his friends and family.
I'm sorry for your loss. It seems like he was lucky to have people around him such as his uncle and yourself. Thanks for sharing this piece of him with us, its just lovely. 
Very sorry for your loss, but I'm glad that you have something like this for people to remember him in the context of something he loved. 

Take care of yourself, mate. 
This is beautiful 
Sorry to hear about your son, I lost a brother that was also really infatuated with Magic TCG. He even sold a good amount of his cards to pay for his surgery, we still have a bunch of his collection. This is a great jester his uncle made for the funeral. I send my condolences and wish you and your family the best.
Sorry for your loss. 
I mean.

Him as a planeswalker means that like..

Creatures will definitely be attacking him.

...Or getting blown up by Dreadbore.

I'm not saying this is a horrible tribute. I'm just saying that even after you bury him, anyone that plays this card will usually be putting 'Joel' in the graveyard.

...Like. The keyword for 'going to the graveyard' ..is Dying.

..Joel will be dying like, constantly. And I mean, that's gonna be terrible for everyone.

"Kill your Planeswalker.. I mean- ...Uh." *Slowly puts Hero's Downfall back in hand.*
That is so cool I am sure he (any magic player would) have loved it.

Sorry about your loss.
This made me smile. It's nice to hear things like this. Sorry for your loss.
I'd play it. Fit right in with my Zedruu EDH deck. However, copying any spell might be a weird interaction...
I'm so sorry for your loss. Genuinely in tears here. Such a lovely tribute. 
Sorry for your loss 
25 is way too young. A loss for the greater Magic community.
Very sorry for your loss.

Friend of mine died six years ago this coming weekend, something similar was done.  I've got a card based on him sitting on my shelf in a screwdown case.  He was the guy I learned the game from back in 1994, and I can still imagine trying to convince him that the goddamn thing isn't called a "Nectrite".
o7
Much respect
RIP
How can one aquire one of these?
Sorry for your loss.
You're a good dad, and your brother is a good uncle.  

Please have my respects.
Is there any significance behind any of the planeswalkers abilities?
why did I read this at 6am now I'm crying
I can't imagine the pain of losing a child. My sincere condolences to you and your family.
How did he die so young?

Damn unfortunate. Marvelous card, however. A fitting commemorative token. Take care and good luck.
Sorry for your loss.
Much Love friend.
:(
did someone cast mana leak on my eyes
Life is hard :( but those kind of gestures is what makes it worth, sorry for your loss and be strong (: really nice tribute!
So sorry for your loss.
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss
I'm sorry for your loss. That's an awesome card. Thank you for sharing it with us.
my condolences. shame to lose someone in the community.
very sweet tribute with lovely art. i'm so sorry for your loss.
Just reading that title was punch in the stomach and I didn't even know him. This is such a touching tribute and I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm glad most of the comments here reflect how caring and supportive the Magic community is.
Played WoW with Joel. He was an amazing person, so sorry for your loss. 
Sorry for your loss.
I'm very sorry for your loss. Joel would be proud of that card.  It's better than most the busted stuff that comes out of the custom magic sub. 
sorry for your loss
Sorry about your loss, that is truly an awesome way to remember someone with a game they loved so much.  
Very good idea and the card design looks very nice. Sorry for your loss. 
Wow I'm sorry for your loss. The card is awesome, I would play it in my control deck for sure. RIP Joel
I'm sorry for your loss.
I am so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the grief and sadness that you must feel, and I'm blown away by the beauty of this tribute to him. 

If you would like to run more copies of this card to fundraise for a cause your son supported, I think many of us would be happy to purchase a playset. Please be gentle with yourself, and thank you for sharing this tribute with us.
this is a nice kick right in the feels. :( sorry for your loss. 
Sorry for your loss, OP. All the best to you and yours.
I'm sorry for your loss, that card is beautiful.  
definitely remember interacting with him in the vancouver magic community. his friendly presence will be missed. sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry about your son. His uncle did a great job with the card and I'm sure your son would love it. 
As has already been said, I am truly sorry for your loss. 
Im sorry for your loss.

That card is actually kind of balanced imo.
So sorry for your loss. This is an incredible tribute. 
I can't even imagine how hard it must be. Thanks for the daily reminder to cherish every moment . Very sorry for the loss 
This is such a touching and sweet thing to do. Are there any available for kitchen table players?
I teared up on this one. Excellent tribute and my condolences for your loss.

Sorry for your loss, I had a friend I played Magic with pass away. Every now and then when I cast Thoughtseize it reminds me of the good times we had together.  Take care.
Your son was clearly a very lucky man to have a family like you and, judging by all the posts from people who knew him on here, you were very lucky to have a son like him. You must be very proud of him, and I'm so sorry for your loss.
So sorry for your loss.
I don't know anything about the card game magic, but if there are loved ones that know him well enough to do something as great and loving as this I am standing and applauding, I am truly sorry for your loss.
Mad feels. Sorry for your loss
I am sorry for your loss.



This is a great way for your son to be remembered in which he would truly appreciate. My condolences to your family.
My condolences to you and your's. Amazing way to celebrate. 
wow. chills. best wishes.
This is a beautiful tribute. My thoughts are with you and your family this evening, OP.
damn, that's some awesome art. 

RIP, op
I am so sorry for your loss. No parent should experience the death of their child.
I'm sorry for your loss.  I'm sure he is in a better place now.
The mana is bothering me...
Looks like his defense went to zero.
I'd love one of his cards that you made 
Condolences. That +1 ability is great the kind of ability white misses. The -2 does work to protect him, absolute bomb to rip in any limited format and an instant constructed staple. 
Did someone cut onions at my desk? Not cool!
Joel confirmed OP as hell.

[UST] Hangman

This card is exactly the kind of fuckery that gets me hype for an Unset. This is sick!
Pick Hangman. It's so obvious, no one would suspect it!
Lets break the card! What is the best word to choose? I am assuming view vowels and uncommon consonants.

Glyph/s (I cant count)

Larynx

edit: added an "s"

Edit 2: Maybe "syzygy" is more common than you all thought.
If someone else gains control of Hangman, do you have to tell them the word?
Syzygy is a real word. No vowels except for the "sometimes y" variant, and even then: _y_y_y doesn't help anyone.
I would consider this casual commander legal.
The intent of this card is obvious: you play a game of Hangman. But the card only notes what happens when a player guesses wrong, not when they guess right. An annoyingly pedantic reading of the card is that the player who starts the game does not have to:

* say the number of letters in the word
* indicate which position correctly guessed letters are in

Edit: if it's not obvious, I think this breaks the spirit of the card. But for some players Maro will need to issue errata to convince them to play an actual game of Hangman.
TNETENBA
Given the nature of the set, I can choose *kwyjibo*, right?
"C'mon, choose ‘monkey.' Everybody loves monkeys"
Pro-tip - "Jazzer" is really hard to guess.
I lost it when I noticed the stick figure tattoo on his chest.
The hangman word in the art is missing the second a... But is the word actually hangman?
100% using erection cause I hope he gets bigger 
The best part of this is that the word spelled in the card art can't possibly be HANGMAN considering the spot where the second A would be is blank.
Would like to point out that "Villian" is apparently now a creature type
This is one of those cards that can be awesome with friends, or super annoying with your "know-it-all" average magic player. 
Totally picking Phthisis. You guessed H first? Have fun being completely baffled.
Havent played magic in 5 years. Are they doing another unhinged/unglued style set?
My gotos for max effect: squirrel, bluffing, password, hangman, tilted.

And if I'm playing any of you assholes I'm guessing the letter "y" first.
Now, it doesn’t say you have to tell them where the letter is or how many there are of that letter.  You just say whether it is in there or not.  

It doesn’t even specify that you have to tell them how many letters the word has, only that it is 6-8.

“SUSSES” is six letters.  They guess “S” and you say “darn.  It’s in there”.  You don’t get a counter, but now they have to guess a six to eight letter word that has at least one “S” in it. 

Am I getting this right?
I love how it encourages its controller to get greedy and risky. The more times you activate it the bigger it gets, but the more and more likely it is to get hanged.
Hmm this would create some weird interactions if it changes controller after entering.

Play Hangman, [[Donate]] it, keep using its ability and guessing wrong, then [[Homeward Path]] it back to yourself if you want a big creature and have more mana and cards then sense.
Does it have to be in English? (or the language the game is being played in)

Edit: Yep

what article was this in?
Wow, Villain as a creature type. It's a shame it's very unlikely for the card with collector's number 1 to be a Villain creature because IF YOU WANNA BE A VILLAIN NUMBER ONE
For those who are also asking "what are the hardest hangman words?"

http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/
this might fly in the face of the spirit of an unset, but i think the word choices for this card are NOT the most unguessable words possible, but rather ones that will give you a few free +1/+1 counters when you need them. if you choose something with an unusual vowel structure (something based around U, for example), you could get a 2/2 or 3/3 with your first couple activations. if the cost keeps being paid after that point it should NOT be you because the odds of getting an immediate benefit keep falling and falling. it just seems like you want to choose a good word, get a couple counters when you need them, then let your opponents waste their mana trying to stop your decently-bodied creature
use the word xerox, It hangs everyone 
haha all these serious mode rules lawyers and amateur game balancers debating how to optimally reveal as little information as possible and the powerlevel of it lel

have fun with that. i know im just gonna have a normal, chill game of hangman with the folks ill play with, cause i'd rather do that with my friends than going IT DOESNT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE ORDER OF THE LETTERS HRHRHR
Quixotry: 1. A wild, visionary idea, an eccentric notion or act
in team games, can your teammate keep guessing incorrectly to pump him up?
I'm so using Naggers for the obvious South Park joke.
Syzygy, only 4 unique letters, no vowels. 
The word in the art can't be hangman
Write the word "syzygy" and profit!
A Crwth is an ancient Saxon guitar. Plural is crwths.
I don't think someone mentioned it yet - Creature type Human **Villain**
Oh my god the dude in the picture has a stick figure tattooed on his chest. I need this card.
Me: Eh I’m not sure how I feel about this new Un set.
*sees Hangman*
Alright this seems pretty fun
I was afraid with all the focus on contraptions and the ally color groups the one-shot joke cards would be subpar. I am no longer disappointed.
In college, I had to write a program where a player could play hangman against a computer. However the computer would cheat wouldn't actually pick a word.Instead it would use the entire dictionary of words and keep picking the largest set of remaining possible words based on the guesses of the player. It would take players at least 17 guesses to get it every time.
Zephyr is 6 letters. :)
wow wow wow...I haven't been paying attention to magic for a few months. What is this?!
I love this, but why would you play the sub-game of Hangman? It's just a 1/1 if you leave it alone, right? I don't hate that in an Un-set, but it also feels like there should be some *MTG* reason to play Hangman, not just as a little side game.
If they are playing hangman in the picture then it should read HA-G- -A-
"Naggers"
It doesn't clarify the word has to be in english. GG my opponents trying to guess random German words from my 4 semester of German!
I need a ruling: is "Kwyjibo" a legal word?
Expected the stick drawing. Was disappointed.
I legitimately thought I was on /r/custommagic at first and came to the comments to see how good/poorly designed everyone else thought it was. 
Alright so I play yugioh and have a vague understanding of how magic works. 

Is this card fucking real? Are there other cards like this? It seems like some bullshit to me lol. Imagine the hangman meta. I honestly can't wrap my head around how this exists in a competitive tcg. 
[deleted]
Wow this card is sweet.
Bullshit
100% using “foreskin” for my word
I’d imagine that this uses Scrabble rules for words.
Text for the work normies?
Let’s just hope he doesn’t get kidnapped again by a WWE Stooge.

He does pair nicely with Scurll with the Villain subtype
How would it work with [[Panharmonicon]]?
Are they making a new unhinged set? Can someone fill this noob in :) I remember they had them back in like 2007/2008
I'm gonna choose cheatyface as my secret word, then reveal my hidden cheatyface when they guess it.
I prefer to use bijoux.
Dwindle
maximum value would be an 8 letter word with NO letters more than 1 per.
You have to guess the letters with out seeing the position of the letters? Hilarious.
99% of the time the word will not be solved. 
This with ring of xathrid would be awesome. 
Couldn't the opponent just never activate the ability? Nice 1/1 for B edit: never mind, the controller of the card can force an opponent to guess. The controller himself can't guess, but the controller can activate the ability to make an opponent guess

Also does the owner of hangman have to reveal how many letters? The intent is obviously to play hangman, but it doesn't say anywhere about confirming the number of letters or location of letters in the word
This is the first card that we've seen so far that actually feels like an Un-card to me. Hype!
Abhenrys - a unit of inductance

Crunodal - a mathematical curve having an ordinary double point

Jumbling - to mix in a disordered manner

Yeshivot - an orthodox Jewish school

Zwieback - a sweetened bread
Which game is this?
Rhythm is a fun word, get those obvious vowel guesses out of the way. 
Wait is this real?
Of note: The word does not have to be English. Spanish alphabet has extra letters
Doesn't specify language. Pick a lengthy series of Chinese pictographs. 
That’s mean!
It doesn't say the word needs to be in English. 
This is sick!
Very cool, very flavorful, but dude looks way too jacked for a 1/1.
Dang, it specifies a minimum letter count.  I’ve always liked using “nth,” which is a mathematical term with no vowels that really messes with people.
Haven’t played magic in about 3 years and didn’t realize an unset was coming out and was very confused for a second. 
Might have to get back into magic. 
This is some great artwork. Is there a link to a full pic or something?
Rhythm is a great word to use for this card because there’s no vowels (except for y)
Megamind u/DurkArcher
Quick question about actual gameplay, strictly strategically speaking, why would you ever guess a letter? As the opponent, you do nothing it’s just a 1/1 right? 
Can my word be 'XXXXXX'?
I'll be using ABLUENTS in case my opponent thinks he's clever by going with UNSTABLE.
is this real?
it would be worth getting back into mtg just for that card lol
Stupid 6-8 letter word rule means I can't use my usual hangman word "HUMUHUMUNUKUNUKUAPUAHAH" the state fish of Hawaii.
I think one of the best words to use with this is "jazzed"
Thanks for telling me your wordz guys ill know what to guess.
Pick rhythms
H U N G M A N
I bought the cards against humanity geek pack. This one hit me right in the feels

What an interesting way to spell "thousands"...
I like how that jab is also printed on purchased cardboard.
My favorite card in there there is still "Tapping Serra Angel." Every time I play the game with muggles and someone plays the card, I get confused looks and questions like "uhh, is she like a porn star or something?" And then I have to explain how it's this surprisingly cryptic joke about a specific magic card from way back in the day whose notable feature it was that it didn't tap unlike every other creature that did so.
It's even worse when you realize you've spent hundreds on digital facsimiles of pieces of cardboard. 
I have this in the first spot in my trade binder, a reminder to anyone who opens it what we are actually doing ha.
Yeah. Hundreds was year #2. Beyond that...
I mean they're are talking about single pieces right, not entire collections. I mean those duals aren't going to buy themselves.

besides, it's an investment,  I swear, like beanie babies.
Money is just paper, so trading up to cardboard is a strict upgrade imo
you could always spend money on really expensive food which  just turns to literal shit.
Those would be joyous wails from me if I suddenly learned I *only* spend hundreds! 
The vintage players must be laughing hysterically...only hundreds?

"lol i could have a Ford Focus, but who needs that when you have a pile of 75 old pieces of cardboard"


I need this on sleeves. 
Yeah, h-hundreds of dollars...right guys?
probably sound salty but playing magic is paying for the art and the game design. When you buy a dvd you're not paying for the round disc. 
...and we used thin pieces of paper to purchase those pieces of cardboard!
I bought most of my dual lands when they were still in print, thinking that $20 for a piece of cardboard was insane.

So many years later, if I ever sold my collection I could pay off all of my debt.

I regret nothing.
Yeah, just like all those fashion people who have spent thousands of dollars on wool and cotton, or all those wine drinkers who have spend tens of thousands on smashed grape juice. And let's not forget all those car freaks who spend fortunes on piles of painted aluminum.

Everything that doesn't strictly uphold existence sounds stupid when you frame it the right way.
Hmmm...if this tanks the market, I still couldn't afford a Black Lotus.
On "A" piece of cardboard. Underground Seas are expensive, doncha know.
At least they're cardboard you can hold in your hands. I've spent thousands on hearthstone and I can't even touch them. 🤙🏻 
My collection is easily worth over $2000 and I only started in May last year...
Hundreds? Casuals...
...but I mean. Money is printed on paper... So it's not like paper products can't be valuable..
Hahahahahahaha.........

Hundreds. Yep.

*sob*
That's pretty funny, but for anyone feeling bad right now I'd like to point out that it's not (just) that we're all addicts. Playing Magic is like playing a board game, except you and your opponent each get to select half of the rules. You have incredible control over how the game looks, the story it might tell, and how you choose to meet your opponents, and your opponent does the same. 

It's really novel, and the level of versatility and customization here doesn't compare well to something like buying just one box of a deckbuilding card game, or a regular board game. If you still feel like you're spending too much on the games you play, though, then I hope you can find some value in a reality check like this.
The irony that you spent digital bits of paper on a piece of cardboard that criticizes you for doing the exact same thing on OTHER pieces of cardboard.
At least these pieces of cardboard have the tendency to retain a fair amount of value. Obviously cards do fluctuate from time to time, especially with newer setsbas they rotate I'm and out of standard, but the value of older sets tend to remain stagnant.

That being said, I really do hope the game continues to thrive as it has, or I'm going to be rather broke...
I didn't pay a single cent for cardboard, i payed it all for the fun i was having.
Even worse when they are digital cards...fml
**The collective wail of every person realizing that they spent their lives earning green pieces of paper**
Hundreds? Ha!
Hundreds.  Pfft!
i was playing cards against humanity one night at my LGS between FNM and a midnight prerelease. the black card was "what i brought to [[show and tell]]".

they told me afterwards that they totally would have allowed me to play [[emrakul, the aeons torn]].
In Russia we literally call the cards "cardboards" sometimes
I long for the days when my collection was still valued only in the hundreds. If I could go back and stop myself at that point, I'd be a rich man today... and then I'd be able to spend all that money on magic cards
*delicious* cardboard.
Ftfy  http://i.imgur.com/lRBBoET.jpg 
Oh sure I post a picture of a piece of armor from d3 called storm Crow and it gets removed yet this here stays.

Thanks
This is totally inaccurate. I've spent tens of thousands on this cardboard thank you very much.
And i payed for them with pieces of paper. Seems like an upgrade to me.
Haha, it's a cards against humanity card
...Shit.
Money is a social construct. And paper.
Seems fine.
just hundreds?
Considering that CAH is *also* mostly cardboard, I would say this is more meta than anything else.
Investment in Magic is still a better investment than CAH
Says the piece of cardboard
[Player Calls Magic Cards Mere “Cardboard”](https://goodgamery.com/2012/09/player-calls-magic-cards-mere-cardboard/)
At least MTG cards have replay value.
I spend money on entry fees to events, but just build my decks from prize winnings. And it's easy to justify spending $10 for 5 hours of hanging out and playing games with friends. The fact that I walk away with cards that have a cash value is just gravy. 
"Oh look! Fifty more Kird Apes!"
I solved this by only playing EDH, and built the decks whose staples are found in common/uncommon bulk or the $1 rare boxes at stores.  Decks such as Yisan (I am pretty sure you could build a winning Yisan list, on $75 or less without cutting Craterhoof, a Staff of Domination and Seedborn.) Craterhoof isn't even a primary win con, infinitely bouncing Great Oak Guardian and swinging at everyone for 42^e10 + trample is.

Another prominent "$50 or less and it WINS" deck is Brago.
Hundreds?  N00b...
"Says the piece of cardboard"
*hundreds* you say...
I giggle every time I get the one that says "Tapping Serra Angel." My wife doesn't get the joke... 
Hundreds.....pfffff
But sometimes you get shiny cardboard!
lol "hundreds"
Says the piece of cardboard.
What's really funny is that Cards Against Humanity fans literally spent money for them to dig a hole and fill it in. They also literally spent money on nothing. 
My girlfriend bought that cards against humanity expansion, and read them aloud to me on the car ride back, this occurred while i had about 20 booster packs i just bought sitting in a bag at my side and she was criticizing me for it... feels man
I get the "joke", but honestly if you're going to be that reductive it applies to literally everything that isn't the absolute essentials. 

Games? Virtual 1s and 0s. Not even real.


Going to the movies? You paid to watch something once. For an hour or three.

Music? Literally just air vibrating. That's what sound is.

But, obviously, you're not paying for cardboard alone are you?
You're paying for the game made out of cardboard. For the experiences you get from that game. For the artwork, the flavor, the gameplay... A lot of work goes into turning cardboard into the game we spend hundreds or thousands on. That's what we're paying for. 
Not even well made cardboard...
See also, "Tapping Serra Angel", which I had to explain to my mother is *not* a sex thing.

...Yes, I play CAH with my mother. She usually wins, too.
They paid for the memories.
Edit: thousands
I started reading it and assumed it would be "when they realized they're playing against a blue mage"
Thousands*
Too brutal for everyday use.  
I feel personally attacked.
There must be a black market then. How can you tell which ones are fake ?
As opposed to?

Got that one in pax 20 anniversary grab bags, interesting they are just barely reprinting and they aren't marked that they were in pax.
Warhammer 40k also smacks your wallet up.
hundreds...pffft.  spent enough to buy a luxury car
It was hundreds before I got my first expansion packs.
Money well spent I say on the epic fun times I've had with my cardboard.
No regrets here. There are far worse hobbies and/or addictions. 
Hundreds of pieces of *paper* for cardboard. Sounds like a pretty decent upgrade if you ask me...
I love the shrieks when I pull out my decks of dog-eared beta cards sometimes in tourneys.
Bitcoin isn't even tangeable
What else is in there? Seems intriguing.
lolhundreds
As a CSGO player, and occasional gun skins purchaser, at least you can hold the cardboard in your hand. 
I'm angry because it's so true
I sold two legacy decks and bought the 1st Appearance of Dr Doom, Wolverine, and a big Doom statue...
Ironic because I have also spent hundreds on Cards Against Humanity boosters as well.
"Think of it like this. Spending $10 on a slip of paper is ridiculous, but if that tiny slip of paper is a movie ticket then you're spending $10 for 2 hours of fun. That's what you're doing with Magic: you aren't buying cardboard, you're buying the experience" -Exclamation Point (youtube)
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha..."hundreds"
thousands... come on
Pieces of cardboard that aren't even type 2 legal any more
ha... ive spent hundreds for cards that were subsequently banned... twin, pod, eye of ugin... 
At least you have cardboard. I have hundreds of dollars invested in Hearthstone pixels. At least my pixels are safe from termites.
Hey I profited almost 300 dollars on my cardboard collection once I moved out and had to pay rent in a hurry a couple of times.


I have spent close to $200 USD on TCG equipment so far.

**In preparation for starting my MTG collection**
Just ordered Commander 17. 

That's another $200 worth of collective wails. 
Tapping [[Serra Angel]]
Hundreds? I know I'm not the only one in the 5 digit range.
So meta...
I sold a piece of cardboard for more than it's weight in gold the other day. This game is weird. 
Does it even count as cardboard? Either way it doesn't make me feel any better haha
Money well spent
Psh I printed all my cards and meticulously forged every one to look almost flawlessly legit.
Hundreds? I've been playing since the 90's. Got my start in High School.

Try -thousands-. 

I actually was getting ready to sell my collection, when my mother's partner's dog conveniently pissed into the sealed Rubbermade box I stored my binders in.
I'm laughing on the outside and crying on the inside
I feel personally attacked 
Been playing since Alpha.

I probably spent that much in the last week picking up new cards for my cube. Now that I think about it, I've spent enough to have bought a house, and sadly I'm not talking about in one of the flyover states... for almost 25 years of entertainment, camaraderie, and travel though? Money well spent
but, but,... black lotus?!!
The man getting paid for this crowdfunded a big hole in the ground.

Don't give a shit about whatever he has to say.
It's not the money that makes me sad, it's not having better ways to spend it.
As somebody who bought a Timetwister four months ago and is still feeling the financial repercussions, this hits home quite well.
Fortunately, the collective wail of us MTG players is drowned out by even louder screams as all humankind realizes they've wasted their lives collecting green pieces of paper.
So...how much on entry fees?

>	hundreds of dollars

thems rookie numbers
all of us.
It really needs to have "suckers" appended to the end of it.. 
I shiver ever time I see that black box at someone's house. I'd rather be clubbed over the head and wake up locked in a box wearing a gimp suit then play a single round of cards against humanity.
If that's hurting your feeling then maybe magic really isn't the game for you...
Post Malone showed up at my LGS so I got him to sign my Trading Post.

HORSEMANSHIP?!?


And congrats my dude!
Where was this at?
I'm beginning to think that Posty is a genuinely good dude.
Did you sign his face in return?
Now activate your Trading Post after Post Malone's post-combat main phase, then post the video on Reddit after some heavy post-editing.
sick! does he play?
That's fuckin sick dude
Is that a white mana symbol tatted on his face?
Everyone taking a moment to dunk on his music while adding that he has a nice personality....
His music isn’t for me but he seems like a really cool guy! Glad you got to run in to him!
Missed opportunity to have him sign all your Cloudposts and Glimmerposts.
Well that's cool. Turns out I have more respect for the guy than I knew
 Bro do you have a fukin wrist? Shit is tripping me out rn
I wish he signed the top by the name, so it would say Trading Post Malone.
Truly a man of the people
Sick, congrats!
Bruh. This is like my holy grail. I love Trading Post so much, this is sick.
I have a Posty signed card, my wife won the last game knights giveaway
Very cool! POST Malone. Trading POST. Get it?
Thats whats up.  Trading Post is underrated.
Post Malone wears glasses?
Wow did you sign his face in return?
Oooo stinky
I don’t find his music appealing but this is awesome.
This is dope I love Posty
So cool, man! What a legend. And that will forever hold such value! Awesome.
He just looks like he’s smells bad
And you got to sign his face? Nice.
That's so sick, love his music and super surprised when I found out he was into MTG
I mean this in as non-creepy a way as possible, but I know it's going to come across wrong.

How does he smell?  I've always seen his image as chain smoking and Budweiser drinking, so I always imagined the answer was not very good.
Rad dude.
Did you trade with him?
A Postie that poses for Post. Beautiful.
lol you guys look like you could be cousins. Did you guys get to play any games? or was he just in and out like batman?
Nice man, while I find his music to be truly amazing and consider him extremely talented, I also think this post is super sick.
I don't listen to Posty but everything I've seen of him online makes him look like a chill guy that anyone would be lucky to have as a friend.
M'alone
Does post play MTG?
NGL, if he showed up at my LGS, I wouldn't even know who tf he was.
Man does he look like a tweaker.
Isn't that the fat guy from Filthy Frank?
What did he buy?
Fuckin awesome. His game knights sparked me to wanna play again after a bit of time away
Did you ask him if he wanted to Post-up and get a game??
This motherfucker just shows up everywhere winning hearts and minds.

Never change, PM, never change.
I’m so jealous that’s awesome!
it looks like he fell asleep on top of a marker
That right there is the face of a happy man, awesome dude XD
Does anyone else think Post Malone looks like early 20’s Shia Labeouf but with lots of tattoos? Weird question, I know, but it’s been bugging me to see if anyone else sees the resemblance
He used to play a smaller digital card game called The Elder Scrolls Legends. He seems like a fun guy to hang out with.
Was he in Saint Laurent jeans, but still in his Vans though?  
  
So awesome.  Congrats!
I give him props for just hanging out playing MTG with us non-famous ppl!
Yooooo this is so dope
Ok. That’s….why is that so cool?! That shouldn’t be as cool as it is. Wow…that’s actually fucking awesome. I’m really glad you’re day has been incredible.
Posty’s LGS is the same as mine he lives in my city but unfortunately I’ve never run into him there. I’m jealous thats awesome!!
was this like one of those situations where he was there all lowkey just chillin, or was it like "POST IS HERE" and there was a mob outside the store type deal?
This had made my morning
He came to mine too!
Goat, literally
So now that this card is signed you've got a Trading Post Malone?
Fair shout man, id love to even get just a basic land signed by the artist, like to see it done and that, awesome, you are now a moment in history 👍
Trading Post Malone
🍻🍻
wholesome…
He was at Da basement Games yesterday in Brooklyn I missed it to busy moving in
Does Post Malone play legacy Glimmerpost? Seems like a missed opportunity if he doesn't.
Brothers by another mother.
Does he smell as bad as I imagine he does?
Did you sign his face?
He plays magic? Cool.
What is LGS?
Trading Post Malone
Does he play magic??
Congratulations!  
https://youtu.be/SC4xMk98Pdc
Trading Post Malone
He's a super cool guy. I heard he loves magic fans..

I just wish I liked his music that's all.
Hey Kyle
Reddit isn't give you much love dude, but thats super funny. Props man.
Nice meme my dude
I didn’t know jail bird shia lebuff dyed his hair and started a new hobby.
WHAT'S AN LGS?

Long.... Guy... Signpost?
The post I saw right before this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/otgro5/yeah_yeah_money_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Sick
Awesome!
God damn it, postie is such a great dude. For all you grunge heads out there, check out the nirvana cover charity stream he did with Travis Barker. Legendary stuff. My respect for postie grew a lot in the last 12 months.
So awesome, upvoted
