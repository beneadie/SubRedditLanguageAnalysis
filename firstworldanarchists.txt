BBC News at it again

Burnt by the British Burning Corporation
And it's the perfect person to have used in the response too.
BBC must have got new interns.
did they actually do this?
This is fucking hilarious. 
"BBC, please never use the word 'Eastenders' again" 
They‚Äôre dabbling in quite a lot of memes lately
What if that guy dabbed back? 
So does the BBC and Wendy's share their social media staff?
Their meetings are like "We're going to take the criticism and answer them with memes"
Why is nobody just posting the bloody link? I shouldn't have to work this hard.

Thats pretty lit like lightning.

This has to be fake, right? 
But really, BBC shouldn't be doing this. They can have their fun through their shows, but when it comes to the news using unusual language risks mis-informing the public.
I don't get it. ELI5 please? 
hi betty white
I will forever associate the word Lit with Dua Lipa and Sean Paul
They had a video on their sports site the other day with emojis platered over it.
Maby its because bbc wants your atenttion.. they did a good job..

God damn my first inclination was anger at BBC using emojis but I'm actually relieved they can shed their serious armor for a minute. It's what we need.
This is the correct response to trend-gate-keepers. 
is that betty white?
BBC News is like Wendy's, they don't give a shit

Is this the real BBC account? Or is it like that one Kellogs (?) account that someone made to troll people getting mad at the real Kellogs because of gay Cheerios?
Where else will you see Madeline Albright dabbing??
do English people dab on their haters too?

Can someone edit this to have the tree explode when she boops the ornament? 
The look on her face is just mah

I earned my black belt in not giving a fuck from my grandma. This particular one hides it well, but have no doubt, these are dangerous people. Never underestimate the elderly.
Somebody stop her!

Technically she touched the ornament. Panics anyway, Like Grandma wasn't going to be tempted by that. lol
My dad would always tell me not put the window up and down and up and down in the car cuz it would wreck something. My logic was "come on, that's exactly what its job is".  So one day I did it back and forth really fast just to bug him.  And then it stopped working.
Should've covered her face, now the FBI is gonna knock on her door soon.
There are 2 types of elderly people. Those who know nothing about the 21st century, and those like this lady: fun and a joy to be around.
Technically speaking she didn't touch the tree. Just sayin.
This is Ross Smith and his grandma everyone! Check him out on snap chat, this guy makes me smile everyday 
At least wait to repost this until Christmas
She didn't touch the tree....coward
Run !!
...and she didn't touch  the tree
the toy, but not the tree

This is Ross Smith and his grandma. They do amazing Snapchats, Instagram and Facebook videos. They're hilarious.
So... when is the execution going to take place?
r/madlads
Technically she touched the decoration which is touching the tree so she only indirectly touched the tree
I mean....technically she didn‚Äôt touch the tree itself.....technically.
Technically she didn't actually touch the tree.
she didnt even touch the tree tho
You know technically she didn‚Äôt touch the tree, she just touched the ball that hangs off the tree. 
Instructions said Tree
Not ornaments.

What is not seen here is that in her rush to get away she tripped and broke her hip leaving her bed ridden and she subsequently died alone 2 days before Christmas.
never too old to start a life a crime.

anyone else think she looks like Michael Cera?
Isn't this the original sin?

Oh ffs! That running made my day :')

And that's why Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

She didn't even touch the tree tho
OMG if you look really close you can see she touched the tree, and there was a sign right there saying not to do that!!!
Well... She didn't touch the tree

This is why I like Reddit. 
f**k the police
Technically she didn't touch the tree, she touched an ornament ;)
She only touched the ordament really, which is touching the tree. If he touched the branches, I dare her ...
The force is alive in this one!
It didn't say anything about the ornaments... 
It said nothing about the ornaments
He touched a christmas bulb not the tree. Not funny.

All old women were once beautiful, playful young ladies. Never forget that even though her body may be stoic, her mind still contains the spirit of her youth.

I think I'll be like her when I get old. Fuck it - touching the tree
I actually know that lady and his grandson haha both from Ohio so funny
And she's still shuffling to this day.  I think she got away with it.

That's a lovely tree.  I wish my Christmas trees turned out half that lovely.
Good thing she's white, black grandma would have been shot fleeing the scene.

This is a year old.

Your (or someone's, at least) address is readable on the bag.

If that tastes the same as delissio pizzas, no thanks.

I can't eat pizza anymore - the picture yesterday of the centipede baked into the crust ruined it for me.

Gold Jerry! Gold!
This is as first world as if gets.
DiGiorno means ‚Äúduring the day‚Äù you can‚Äôt order it at 20.28.. it‚Äôs evening already
I'm glad he picked this particular angle to take the picture, otherwise I won't get it.
You rapscallion!
It‚Äôs not delivery it‚Äôs delivery. 
I keep trying to order the small ones but they give me the big ones instead 
I would rather been the taste buds off my tongue than eat Digiorno over a delivered pizza.
This is such a blatant ad, it's disgusting.
I cant believe i ordered these recently and didn‚Äôt take a picture for reddit. I missed out on karma riches :(
Anyone else feel the ground shaking? 
An ad within an ad. Very nice. 
I love frozen pizza but DiGiorno is the worst. Why?
This is blasphemy
If you‚Äôre going to get it flown in why not Red Baron? It‚Äôs both cheaper and actually tastes like pizza not bread with toppings.
You are an animal!!! This is how society crumbles. 
OP is a [big phony](https://old.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/8rj7jl/i_went_and_had_it_delivered_anyway/e0rtvjl/), this picture was taken in May. The delivery date is right on the bag.

You are a complete savage. Also because in Italian the brand name "DiGiorno" means "during daytime", and you ordered pretty much at night
Are you insane? You are, I can tell.
This is delightfully paradoxical
This is a quality post. Well done.
You should cook the pizza, order something else on prime now and then give that delivery person the pizza

Nice ad, shill. 
*knock, knock* ‚ÄúHello¬ø it‚Äôs a delivery! It‚Äôs digiorno!‚Äù
Ad ad ad ad ad

This is an ad
"I sure do hate the one percent and evil corporations, but when it comes to my pizza, thanks Amazon!."
Am I the only one who hates Digiorno's? I mean super thick breading and too much of that crappy sauce.
This feels way more like r/hailcorporate than most
Hey!  I used to live there years ago.  It was a different apartment though :(

You should probably block out you address, if you don't want people stopping by unexpectedly..FOR PIZZA!
[deleted]
You‚Äôre actually fucking insane 
Amazon is so shameless with their shilling.
It's not delivery. It's delivery.
    if (delivery && digiorno) {
        world.explode();
    }
It‚Äôs not delivery it‚Äôs digior....it‚Äôs deliver.....its....pizza
I‚Äôve never been more confused. I don‚Äôt know if this is delivery or DiGiornos
Now! I understand that vine haha 
Wait...so it is delivery?
Anything be else see a movie poster for Digiorno Rising? Like that pizza about to start snacking on some other pizzas 
We live in an age where ordering fucking cook it yourself frozen pizza can be delivered to your fat ass by UPS for free with prime.
I hope it unfroze and everything melted
I‚Äôd pay someone the delivery premium to warm up the pizza and bring it to my house
What's next? Prime now instant?
I prefer "pizza by alfredo" but thats just me. 
Absolute mad lad 
But... It‚Äôs not delivery 
DiGiorno: It's not delivery! 

You: "It'S NoT DElIverY¬°"
Ehh digorno doesn't particularly tatse that good other frozen pizza is way better 
You son of  a bitch.
The absolute madman.

I can only imagine the headshaking going on at Amazon and Digiorno. 
^^^^^I ^^^^^don't ^^^^^get ^^^^^it... ^^^^^Help ^^^^^pls ^^^^^:c
It's not delivery,... it,, its digiorno. I'm sorry

I'm gonna say it, delivery is better than digiorno 


Way too much dough and sauce, flavorless crust too



I dont get it, can someone explain this to me?
I‚Äôm honored to be part of this beautiful timeline.
IT'S NOT DELIVERY, IT'S DIGIORNO. YOU CAN'T DELIVER DIGIORNO. IT SAYS SO RIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK.
"now: for when you need non delivery pizza delivered just in time for dinner- just like delivery pizza"
Enjoy your dough with sauce. It's not pizza.
I really wish I had prime now where I live. I miss having it

This is seriously the fifth time in tbe past week I've seen Blade mentioned somewhere you wouldn't expect it. The universe really wants me to watch it.
This hands down the funniest one I've ever seen.
At one point I caught a Blade movie on one of those channels that "pgified" R rated movies by changing all the swears and replacing the blood with rainbows. To this day I have not laughed harder at anything on a screen. 
That drawing of a box is making me uncomfortable 
That tattoo though...

Idk about the rest but the -3x+3 isn‚Äôt shown or else there would be a line going through (0,3). Pretty sure this is fake
Truly first world!
I used to do stuff like this all the time on my calculator during maths when I was bored. I'd draw shit with graphs for fun. There's a simple way to make the lines end, making it much cleaner. You just get your equation, and square root it, then do it to the power of 1.999999. This means it cuts off anything below the 0 line. Then you can move it again to cut off another section etc. 
Some men just want to watch the world learn
Can someone explain this to us non-mathematical types please? I‚Äôm clueless.

The real First World Anarchy here is not in the plot, nor the choice of message. It's in the use of i(x) as a function. Nobody uses i(x). It's just diabolical.

What does the lines and the curcel mean?
Am I retarded or are those equations way too complicated for like three straight lines and a circle
A real graphitiest would provide the equations for a polar coordinate system version of the symbol.

This is... I'm speechless... take my upvote
/r/madlads
Like the concept but disappointed the artist didn't use a larger base for the stencil so it was just the equation, clean. 

Take this as a lesson kids, plan for your stencil to cover the full arc and diffusion of your spraypaint. Also it's easy to carry a larger stencil around in a mail tube.

God math is gay
/r/theydidthemath

None of you guys did the math :(

The linear equations there don't create those lines, nor could they ever create an anarchy symbol regardless of whatever the semi-circle equations do.

Consider just the third and fourth equations.  In order to solve for the unique intersection of two lines, you set the equations equal to each other, ie. 3x-3 = -3x+3.  Solve this and you get that the x-coordinate of the intersection is 1, and further plug this into the equation of either line to see that the y-coordinate is 0.

Now look at the fifth equation, the one describing the line that forms the horizontal(ish) portion of the "A".  At x=1 the equation becomes y = 0.2*(1) + 1.7 = 1.9.

What does this mean? It means that the intersection of the two more vertical lines is **below** the third line.  There is no way that this could ever form the "A" symbol in the above image.

Or, you know, you could just look at [this link to wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+3x-3,+plot+-3x%2B3,+plot+.2x%2B1.7) to see what I mean.

EDIT: thanks all! Turns out the pic was just too jpeg'd for me to see the correct equation.

You all did the math and I have never been so proud :)
Some-a-body touch-a my Graphett!

Wrong circle equasion.

This is correct= | x^2 +(-r) | + | y^2 +(-r) | = 1

R is the circle position, 1 the radius

Or how I like to imagine it, "Hey there are no sausages allowed on the bus. Peter do you have two hots dogs in your pockets?" 
The sign actually means: "Sausages - Sold Out"

Which is no surprise, since the guy in the pic is hoarding... He probably purchased both sausages they had.

[I found this on the label printer at work](https://imgur.com/GiPjVm3)
In high school I use to write that in the side bar on scan-trons, you know, the blue box that says "Do not write on this area" and I'd write "Ok". 
I feel like that label itself was unnecessary 
A true anarchist would say "No." 
That could actually be a quality check label. 
I may just be used to seeing poor spelling, but I'm so surprised they spelled 'unnecessarily' correctly.

I always put one on saying ‚ÄúLabel Maker‚Äù
We got some /r/madlads in da house. 
I have one of these in the office. Welder asked to borrow it today. I track him down a few hours later to get it back. He forgot to delete his history. It read "2018 NFL World Champion Philadelphia Eagles!" I thought he was going to use it for work
There's still room for a CANCEL button
Communicating that an order has been understood is never unnecessary. I see nothing wrong with this lad. 
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. 
Edit: wrong fucking post 
At my old job, we had a fancy label machine that was rather complicated and temperamental, However I took the time to figure out the programming, and was put in charge of creating labels for what was needed. The labels were high quality, as in a hundred bucks a roll. People came in all the damn time asking for labels for stupid shit, stuff that you could use a post it note for. They never understood how temperamental those machines were, and just wasted my time and our money.


That being said, my basement where my mates and I smoke pot has some fantastically hilarious ‚ÄúNo Smoking‚Äù labels all over.
Look at the angle where the sticker should be on the letters "AB" in the word "LABELS" and I can't see how this is real.  Stupid to fake, but still fake.

It's almost a 90 degree angle yet the words and tape stay straight.  To be clear, I don't think it's all the way fake, they probably edited it because the words were skewed, the rest of the sticker itself looks really real, and just that area looks different than the rest of the photo.
Forever ago when I was working at a place that required Flare.  My assistant manager had a label maker that he was very stingy with, wouldn‚Äôt let anyone even touch it.  He made the mistake of leaving  it out one night while a bunch of us stayed for ‚Äúbug night‚Äù prep. Next morning he came in-we had labeled dozens of decorations Tuba-bowling pin-unflattering photo of Joe Demaggio.  
Love this
God, I irrationally love label makers. I got one as a gift as a kid and it was probably my favorite toy.
Is it possible to learn this power? 
At least there was some economy of characters used. They could have printed o.k. or okay (or Okay.)
My mom owned a store years back and my absolute favorite part was my child self printing endless labels.
Genius 
aight 
That may be the word I have the most trouble spelling. I get it wrong every single time so badly that not even autocorrect can help me
https://comb.io/EHeyvj
I work at a school and recently had to put up signs saying not to post anything on the walls. They hadn't even been up for an hour before I heard someone telling his friend "except for this one, I guess"

Those were put up with painter's tape while the ones we took down used packaging tape, you little prick.
Spelling unnecessarily correctly... Respect. 
Two things, I want that label printer, and OK was definitely a reasonable response
Do those things have a qwerty keyboard or is it one of the bullshit ones that goes in the order of the alphabet?
Mine is labeled "~‚≠êlabelmakerüåü~"
If cost cutting measures have gotten so extreme that you're micromanaging the label maker, you're probably going out of business. 
Wow 
I have that same label maker at work. It's a boss.
This is amazing. My husband got me a label maker for Mother's Day and I am definitely going to put ironic labels on it now. 
Do not comment unnecessarily
Ignore that sign every time 
Unnecessary labels is all I use those for at work. üòÅ

International Nationalism

Strange if you go to her twitter she tweets (mostly retweets) almost non stop every two minutes. The sheer volume of tweets she cranks out is absurd, she can't possibly be reading beyond the headlines. 

She also appears to be a white nationalist worried about whites being an "endangered global minority". She has 50k subscribers on youtube. Scary stuff. 
They are nationalists to their own countries 
i still cant really support the trend of just picking the most retarded people from the "enemy team" to make a point about how idiotic the group is
d
International ALLIANCE of nationalists.
I really don't see what's wrong here.
This isn't necessarily inconsistent and there has been a long history of solidarity between segregationist, nationalist, racist, or separatist movements that you might not expect. The American Nazi party and the Black Panthers had some connection, and the actual Nazis had occasional high level contact with early Zionists.

The idea of an international alliance of nationalists makes sense; the idea that everybody wants to just mind their own business and they all individually want to rebel and throw off the international global elite who they imagine to be subjugating them all collectively isn't actually that crazy.
This isn't contradictory at all, a good example of this would be the Axis during the Second World War.
I don't see what's wrong with this
I thought it was a joke, but then https://twitter.com/TaraMcCarthy444/status/922655458548215808
do you guys actually think theres any contradiction being made here? There isnt, the sentence just sounds funny.
OP is misunderstanding what nationalism is. You can have an international union of nationalist governments. That's what the Axis powers were in WW2. Also, globalization is very different from globalism.
To be fair, that is actually possible 

You can arguably call the axis countries an ‚Äúinternational alliance of nationalists‚Äù, can you not?
I don't think op really knows what nationalism means? neither does the person replying in the post.
Isn‚Äôt it great what nations can accomplish working together?
The point is that all nations should put their own people first. There‚Äôs nothing contradictory about this.
There's literally no contradiction here, OP is just an idiot. 
Lot of American nationalists applauding Brexit, that's probably what she's referring to. 


This girl is stupid and a racist and there's loads of idiotic tweets to make fun of her for, but this tweet is not one of them...
So I'm kind of confused. Are they consciously supporting an international body of nations devoted to supporting isolationism? As in, are they aware that's what they're doing? Is this a real thing?
I don't see what's contradictory about an alliance between nationalists. you're mistaking isolationism and nationalism as being one and the same.
Curious to know what some people in this thread have against nations working together for a common good. Why does one nation need to be better or best? Why can‚Äôt we instead focus on raising each other up? 
One analogy is in scientific research. It used to be extremely competitive (and it still is to a degree) and individual scientists would race to find a discovery the fastest. But recently, we‚Äôve seen scientists at different universities who would normally compete work together and produce amazing discoveries at record pace. Why us vs. them? Why not good for both?
Also, I realize competition is a driver. I‚Äôm not saying we should eliminate it entirely. But why can‚Äôt human good be a driver?
[Oh this girl is a real peach... ](https://youtu.be/tTNfiNh5Nic)
Those stupid nationalists, not understanding that their own ideology says that they are never allowed to cooperate with anybody outside of their own country and have to hate them all.

We sure owned them by catching them contradicting our ridiculous strawman of their ideology.
/r/iamverysmart.

The irony is that what you're trying to make fun of her for actually makes sense, what doesn't make sense is your inability to understand it.

She is just praising nationalism and her perception that others also enjoy nationalism, despite the fact they are from different nations. She is not praising a unification of nationalists as one entity, rather that they can hold the same political ideology whilst also being their own groups.

Whether you agree with her point or not is irrelevant, your ability to understand her statement is the fault in this situation.

Man I wish people would think about the things they say and do.
Do you really think nationalism means fuck other countries? This makes sense.
By god I feel sorry for this sub if you actually think that's a contradiction.
Honestly that's what nationalists want. To love each other, you must first love yourselves.

To anyone who thinks nationalism is bad, you might be thinking of imperialism. That's bad.
24 hours a day, somewhere on earth, the sun is shining on a flat earther!
I have still never seen a convincing reason why globalism is inherently bad.

Wow, looks like they have complete knowledge of what their cults stand for!
People have a favorite basketball team but they also come together to enjoy basketball as a whole. 

So... an "alliance" of people who love basketball but are "nationalist" for their preferred team.

We root for our guys but in the end we can enjoy the sport as a whole, even with fans of other teams.
That doesn't mean we dissolve the teams into one big team so that we are all rooting for the same side.

I don't see the problem here.
Yeah it sounds stupid but an international alliance of nationalists was literally what the Axis powers were.
This isn't contradictory and if you think it is, you're retarded.

This has always existed. Nationalists have banded together to fight what they perceive to be a cosmopolitan elite force than wants to homogenize the world to further advance their control. Independent nationalistic forces looking to fight this common enemy is not similar to imposing a single ideological, world standard that is what, in their view, globalists are trying to do. 
International group of nationalists is different than globalists
The tweet doesn't exactly not make sense. There could be an international alliance of people with the same goal of putting their own nations first. I mean it's possible. 
This actually makes sense. Shows how simple minded this sub is. The goal of nationalism is for every country to put their own interests first. I want the US to put the US first and Mexico to put Mexico first. I want every country aka the globe or internationally, whatever you want to call it. To take care of their own peoples.
This post proves how dumb reddit is.
You guys are all idiots
Thank you for this! 
I don't see anything wrong with this ? 
You know you can be a nationalist and still colaborate with other nationalist from other countries right ? Globalism is about losing nations identities by streamlining everything, Nationalism is about keeping traditions of each country in said country.

I am not saying I support her nationalist views, just that the sentence makes perfect sens. Before trying to mock others, try to understand the meaning of words.
To be fair the tweet is constructed in some semblance of logic. To fight globalization you need nationalists in as many countries as possible to fight it. If you don't it becomes the global government vs your country which is the last sovereign nation.
**INDIVIDUALISTS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!**
Nationalists and isolationists are not the same thing.
Too much people here confuse Patriotism with Nationalism. Patriotism is ok, nationalism is pretty shit.
This makes sense though? International alliance, not international union. She's implying that they're on the same side and may work together though hell if I know, not that they are becoming one entity. Nationalists aren't isolationists they just want their sovereignty.
To be fair, having an "international alliance of nationalists" isn't necessarily contradictory. An alliance implies consensual agreement between sovereign entities, still as decentralized units, but freely coming together for whatever reasons. Nationalism isn't necessarily "fuck all agreements or alliances period", it's "the needs of my people come before the needs of others'". Besides, their stated goal is the battling of globalism -- an ideology that believes in universal governance by a single entity, as well as the free movement of all peoples anywhere they please. Having an alliance of nationalistic countries isn't globalistic in the slightest. 

But, Reddit isn't generally about fairness and logic, so rain on the downvotes.
This is not oxymoronic, as nations can collectively revel in putting their own interests first. That being said, ethnonationalism is a garbage ideology and this woman seems to be a complete idiot.
This is not even retarded or stupid, like this flat earth tweet. National socialism doesn't mean you doesn't talk with any other country, and it neither means that you hate every other country.
Its about having an international tapestry instead of cultural destruction and conformity into global culture. Simple enough.
Nationalists allying with other nationalists isn't the same as globalism. This is a silly post, and speaks volumes about the opponents of nationalism.
Dumbasses
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Isn't globalism just code name for Jews 
The fact people think this is contradictory and in any way comparable to the flat earth analogy might be the most retarded reddit has ever been. How the fuck is this post on 10,000 upvotes, holy shit. 
International nationalism is a thing, that's not what is funny here.

What's funny is there is no such thing as international anti-globalism. That's just rebranded alt-globalism.
It's not that hard to understand. 

An African Nationalist is one that wants Africa to be an African/Black Ethno State. 

A White Nationalist is one that wants an historically white country to stay white.  Eg, England, Scotland, Germany, Norway, Poland

An Israeli Nationalist is one that wants Israel to be a Jewish Ethno State. 

All of these people want their own country for their own people. They can be united in that ideal. Ethno states are not saying they are superior to others. They would of course trade, invite tourism etc. 


But there is nothing wrong with this. Nationalists wants nationalism for every people. And they can support each other.
How does this fit into the theme of this subreddit?  Someone saying/typing an oxymoron is "first world anarchism"?  i'm confused

ninja edit:  i guess posting this in this sub is the anarchism here.  i think i get it now.  meta 
???...The lefty circle jerk is trying to make it seem that an alliance of nationalists over the globe=globalists?
What a stupid post. You can be nationalist and like and be friends with other countries and support anti globalism together.... Is this a joke?

For me Spotify is my dream music player, Pandora was always kind of shitty
Apple Music, a popular music streaming service, asked it's twitter followers "What's everyone listening to this morning?" And a fellow anarchist, a guy who gets it, stuck it to the man and replied "Spotify." Spotify, if you didn't already know, is another popular music streaming service and is a large competitor to Apple Music. This man's act have brought destruction to Apple ever since.
Personally, I like Google play music
 I've tried both pretty extensively, for full transparency I own an iPhone. If people didn't know, this means I can ask siri to play songs for me in Apple Music, but not the Spotify app. 

Even with Apple's closed ecosystem favoring their own music service, I still enjoyed Spotify much more. The user interface, the playlists, and the discover algorithm were all MILES ahead of what Apple Music currently offers. 

I'm sure that some features of Apple Music appeal to different users, but as someone who was super pumped about it, it really fell short and Spotify stepped in to fill that void.

Spotify, easy and smooth, well built app
I prefer Apple Music.
But Spotify doesn't have the brand new album so nah. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Spotify really is the best music app right now. I've tried just about everything, pandora, soundcloud, youtube, apple music. The problem is the free version does suck. Premium is the only way to go. I never thought I would pay $10 a month for music but it's worth it.

It's funny 'cause its true

Honestly, Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora all bombard me with ads, but at least Spotify has many different ads so I don't listen to the same three ones on loop. It was getting annoying when the station ran out of songs to play and the ads become more frequent

Why does everyone use streaming service? I feel like the only one to play local mp3 files. 
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 50) with your post!

Spotify is terrible. 
Unpopular opinion here. Every music streaming service is terrible.
Legit beast
That's so good
Lmao

GOOOOD DAAAYMMNN!
Burn MFERs
Brutal. Savage. Rekt.
Your mom complaining 'bout how sore she is from last night.
Deezer? Anyone?...
Apple is gonna need gonna need a senzu bean for that burn.
Apple Music seems to be the only thing that allows proper browsing on the nav in my car. If it weren‚Äôt for that, I‚Äôd be right over with Spotify. 
I prefer illegally downloading songs.
Spotify is the best. You pay 5 dollars a month as a student and you can download all you want
Apple be like: http://gph.is/1bhkrl6
I personally prefer Tidal
Absolutely mad
The sole reason I use Apple Music is because it plays right away when I start my car up via Bluetooth. With Spotify I'd always have to open the app and choose a playlist or song. 

Even with Apple Music having been closed it somehow always launches and will pick up right where I left off most of the time, otherwise it will just play songs from my library. Either way, it plays something. I never have to launch it. 

Dumbest game changer ever, but I hated waiting. Libraries are basically the same and I never use Apple radio or anything anyways.
Fake and gay
Nah
Not using Apple Music instead of Spotify is stupid if u have an iPhone. 

Having my own music mixed up with apple musics list is just everything I need.

BOOM!!! That's what a burning apple smells like. 
Ouch! Do we have any ice packs for that burn?
Boss 'em who's show
I prefer Apple music because it is the cheapest in my country. 
I don't know I use Apple Music because I have an iPhone and the integration is great for me. I'm sure if I used an Android I would've stuck with Spotify but the ability to tell Siri what song to stream is great along with the seamless combination of my own library. Like I said though if my phone used a different OS I would've stuck with Spotify as it was a great service as well.
i didn't, because obviously i dont use it. but ontop of that yer music cant also be changed by siri - which is clutch when driving 
but none of that changes the fact they don't compensate the artists properly and thats the reason ill never use it 
How does this fit the sub? 
Spotify? ha sorry but i prefer to listen to my music without commercials - while being able to either stream or download it so i can listen offline (same subscription) and not run out of data 
oh and the fact the artists are actually compensated is swell
