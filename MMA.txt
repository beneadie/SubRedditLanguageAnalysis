Dana White on the Mayweather/Paul fight announcement.

‚Äúvia ‚ÄòNelk Boys‚Äô‚Äù lmfao and that‚Äôs the state of journalism!
One month later:

"Zuffa Boxing presents Conor McGregor vs Jake Paul"
Book Ngannou VS whoever the top Fortnite kid is.
Floyd is going to get a quick payday for a NOTHING fight that doesn't count on his 50-0 record.... god bless him.
Forgive me, but isnt there an enormous size difference?
Yes Dana. Please, keep going. Don‚Äôt stop.

This is nothing new, Muhammad Ali was doing exhibition matches where he clearly didn't put real effort in back through the 70's and 80's. Exhibition matches haven't been serious boxing in a long time. Paul might take it seriously, he might put in real effort, but if Mayweather does anything more than wait for the decided time to end the match I'd be surprised.
This is the same guy who allowed CM Punk to fight on a main card

Edit: Twice
We are edging closer and closer to celebrity death match
Mayweather and Paul's combined payout for this fight is probably going to be higher than the combined payout for 10 UFC cards.
Logan gonna win first round KO üí™üí™üí™
Idk I think people are overreacting to this. It's a retired boxer doing an exhibition match. This is like the celebrity vs old retired nba players, its not a disgrace to the sport, its just for fun.
tbh i wonder if floyd will even train for this ahaha
Next month:

Dana White: "PACQUIAO AND NGANNOU! MARCH 2021!"
The "state of boxing" also just saw two 50-somethings and a youtuber x NBA player pull 1.6M PPVs.  Boxing might be on the verge of out-casualing the UFC if shit keeps going this way
This is the same guy that signed CM Punk in the UFC? Come on man, we all know he'd sign these guys in a heartbeat because all he cares about is money.
Why does anyone care about an exhibition?

The ufc is having an all time resurgence and fighter pay is going down, while boxers on free cards are making more than what Gaethje and Dustin will make to b side huge Ppvs.
I don't like it, bit certainly can't blame either of them. 

Definitely embarrassing for the sport of boxing
Is it going to make money?  
Yes  
Is it complity stupid?  
For sure
This is the correct take.

Unfortunate that myself and millions of other will watch this train wreck anyways :(
He's not wrong.
Have some fun you nerds. This is entertainment, and it will be entertaining. Nothing wrong with silly exhibitions when boxing is also putting on legit fights.

‚ÄúNelk boys‚Äù
Floyd should just fight a moose with a parrot sitting on its shoulder, would make about as much sense
Dana white: "state of boxing is sad because social media influencers are the big draws"

Also releases said statement via fucking "nelk boys".
Is Jake Paul being drug-tested?
If Logan Paul isn't dumb enough already. He will be once Mayweather gives him brain damage.
Red Goof just salty he couldn't put it on himself lulz, remember earlier this year him and Floyd were talking about working together in 2021 and they were gonna make a big announcement about it? What happened to that?
Wait, this is for real? I thought it was a joke..
Dana White's the same guy who let CM Punk piss himself in the octagon, right?

Hypocrite Harold's at it again lmao
Everyone do yourself a favor and save the 5 minutes of your life and dont watch this bullshit. Just watch the replay and call it what it is, a money grab.
You let CM Punk fight Dana.
& yet they will earn more MONEY than all of the top UFC stars


LOL

Dana White is a bum. State of the UFC. Don't Throw stones in glass houses.

Boxing has more great competitive fights and the fighters get payed well year after year. Only casuals or haters think boxing is dieing.

Your "stars" Khabib & McGregor buggered off after less than a handful of years in the spotlight whilst getting payed dogshit. The UFC is a joke.
Even as an exhibition this is fucking embarrassing.
I love the way dana phrases things "fucking video game kid from england" rofl. He is basically me except somehow hes managed to become the head of a giant corporation while i just offend people around me and in turn limit my career growth
Sooooo that's a "No" to Zuffa Boxing then?
Wasn't Dana training to have a boxing match with Tito?
you know what, paul is such a piece of shit that even though i'm not a fan of boxing i'd consider watching an actual boxer proceed to give him brain damage.
damn floyd is desperate for cash
I don't think what people are doing in some glorified Tough Man exhibition fights really reflects on the state of actual boxing one way or another.
Floyd bets everything on Logan with those tasty 15:1 odds, throws match... easy 15x wealth in exchange for dignity payday.
Dana would book this faster than a Vegas hooker if it was under UFC boxing.
I wonder what it would cost for Floyd to take a dive. It would be one of the biggest spectacles in the history of ever if Jake Paul KO'd Floyd Mayweather.
Do not like Dana at all, but he hit the nail on the head honestly.
I think we just like seeing Jake Paul get beat up?
Kimbo Slice would literally kill this paul brother in a fight, Kimbo went out in a few seconds in his first MMA fight. Is this kid a knuckle dragging nerve damaged PePega or what?
Ain't this the dude that let CM Punk fight on an actual main event card in the UFC?
if Mayweather was 30 years older, this could actually be a close fight.
Four years ago this month a scientific experiment made mostly of steroids had a professional MMA bout against a 49 year old professional wrestler. 

Don't pretend, from your glass house, that the circus promotions are the "state of boxing", Dana.
Nadia Kassem fakes a glove touch and immediately gets dropped by Ji Yeon Kim

[deleted]
[deleted]
What a pity that wasn‚Äôt a one punch KO. That would have made this possibly the ultimate MMA gif of all time.
She is awful
Lmao shes aussie and the aussie crowd bood the fuck out of her after this
She does that little stutter step that a person does when they arent that good at fighting.  Added to that awkward leg raise when she tried to punch.  It‚Äôs wild she made it into the UFC.
*me on UFC 3*
God, she's so bad. Who fakes a glove touch and then runs chin first into their opponent?
The little run on the spot before charging in makes it even better.
even the way she falls is unathletic
Faceplanted in the fence too. Such a bush league move to pull this stunt. I remember being really disappointed when Evan Tanner did this in a fight once, although that may have been against Baroni so I'll give him a pass.
r/instantkarma
So well deserved
That was satisfying to watch
All that scumbaggery for... a teep? That's what she's gonna trash her reputation for? That kick had no chance of even being the beginning of the end for her opponent. All she did was re-create the distance she just closed with her little fake gove touch. What a maroon.
That probably already made most people dislike her and then getting finished by that humble Korean chick, really satisfying haha
This is the most Australian Top Team thing i‚Äôve seen in a while
Prior to this fight, Kassem broke her hand via punching her car after a loss. Dead serious.
Look how crap she is. She does this stupid shimmy after it and runs in with her head open.

It's fucking mental that she got into the UFC. There are people who have never done martial arts who fight better than her, purely on a technical basis. I'm not exaggerating at all.

Ah well. Needed another woman from the southern hemisphere when they go to Australia, I guess.
You can tell she's really good by the way she runs in place like a cartoon then paws out a punch like a toddler, if she didn't get dropped that other girl's life was in danger. /s 

The cheapshotter also fights like someone that was homeschooled.
She doesn't belong in the ufc
What were those hands doing? Almost like she forgot the opponent is there to knock her out.
Poor sportsmanship
Y didn't she commit all the way if she's going be sneaky about it? What is a teep kick going do? At least do the Anderson kick that Steven seigel taught him
[removed]
Faking a glove touch is the most disgusting thing you can do in fighting sports.
She got into the ufc on a 3-0 record piggy backing on the moktarhain cans right
Lmao typical Western Sydney trash.
She's just a typical western Sydney eshay pos like tuivasa only people actually like him for some reason
She‚Äôs trash...both in the ring and character wise. Don‚Äôt need pos poor sports like her in MMA. Plenty of amazing female fighters who don‚Äôt pull this type of sorry shit. Fuck her.
Why would you even do that? Destroy all your credibility with the fans in hopes of landing some shitty little kick that was unlikely to do any damage even if it landed perfect.
Nadia Kassem is a joke. She‚Äôs too focused on her instacareer
You get what you fucking deserve
shoutout to jiyeon kim, she was meant to fight grasso but got injured in training smh heal up firefist
One of the greatest angers known to man, is to watch someone fake a glove touch.
Weren't her and Suman Mokhatarian pretty much caught padding their records pre-UFC and got exposed
Kassem is a talentless ass hat so needs to cheat to have any hope in hell.

This gif isnt the only part Kassem got fucken annihilated the entire round and then bitch and moaned on social media blaming everyone else. 

Lol What a pathetic excuse of a human being
So glad she lost
Oof, just found out she is from West Sydney and thinks she is a lad/lass ESHAYS

( am Australian )
hahaha, what a jack ass
What‚Äôs the point of even faking a glove touch if you‚Äôre gonna throw a weak kick like that
Nadia ‚Äúboth a cheater AND a loser‚Äù Kassem
What a fucking unsportsmanlike asshole move.  Fuck her
She's such as dirty human being. Someone needs to tell the UFC to stop signing fighters from western sydney and feeding their already lofty egos. I'm from Sydney and I'm saying that. They're fucken gronks. Just listen to their interviews if you need proof.
This is everyone who trains where she trains
Lol nice. WOMP
Had that coming big time.
Sweet justice
You get what you fucking deserve!
This Nadia women telegraphs her kicls SSOooooo much with her footwork. Looks at those stutter steps. It's like someone telling you they are about to strike.
Got what she deserved. That type of unsportsmanlike conduct should not be tolerated.
Ultimate instant karma
I‚Äôm unfamiliar with MMA.  Why would you even try something so trashy?
Isnt this the girl who broke her hand cause she tried to fight a car?
Kassem is a bum and she‚Äôs only signed for early prelims for ANZ cards.
r/justiceserved
She disabled comments on instagram
Funny thing is Nadia Kassem has comments turned off on Instagram. I was hoping to read people roasting her but unfortunately she couldn‚Äôt take the heat even after talking all that shit and calling people pansies for being butthurt about her unsportsmanlike conduct.
Kassem also spits out her gum gaurd when she's getting pummeled. One of the nastiest fighters on the roster for sure.
If someone does that, it‚Äôs cause they know they won‚Äôt win in a fair fight
The lower level female mma fighters seem so damn uncoordinated compared to the top females. She just ran in with her hands down
She got what she deserved
Lmao Nadia sucks
Why even touch gloves? They have a chance during the face off with referee. And a lot of them use this in some way to close distance at the start of the round.
THOTIA KASSEM
What u guys think she‚Äôll do once she loses her next fight and gets cut?
I remember watching this fight. She tried to touch gloves again the 2nd round and acted like Kim was being disrespectful by not touching gloves lol.

Besides that, it was very clear after about 30 seconds that Kassem has minimal talent, and is all talk and image with nothing to back it up. Tattoos, ankle wraps, waving her arms and resetting her stance like Shogun Rua, acting like she is a proficient stand up striker when in reality she stood out of range the entire fight firing off air punches and kicks bc she lacked the skill and/or toughness to engage or get in fighting range. She‚Äôs basically the sparring partner who wants to look cool but can‚Äôt actually fight for crap.
Black doesn't seem like much of an athlete. Not fluid in her movements at all.
Bad sports never win!
I always get so anxious watching wmma. It's like they're moving in slow motion.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Bitch move
instant karma
Who goes for the fake glove touch and follows it with a body kick. No attempt to combo it, just faked the glove touch and had no plan. Deserved to get flattened. Fantastic on Ji Yeon Kim for finding the opening to quickly and not missing.
Viewing her instagram in combination with reading how she's never made weight in the ufc and this fake glove touch makes me hope she's gone
"You get what you fucking deserve" - Joker
The difference between Kassem and Kim's instagram accounts is dramatic. Duck lips, narcissism, and smack talking versus puppies, babies, friends, and fighting. u/champyoni
When the bell rings it's "protect yourselves at all times".. but there's is also a courtesy of touching gloves/hands and then go at it.
Conor pulled a similar move where he touched and a second later launched a roundhouse kick.
That‚Äôs bullshit anyway you slice it, but given the results of 10 seconds directly after, maybe even she knew she had no shot besides a cheap one.
wish Ortiz did this to Mayweather
What the hell were those quick little steps running after her after the bad kick. She‚Äôs looks / acts like the furthest thing from a professional fighter
EZ claps
What a "dick" move! üôÑ
We can call that left hook...karma
what the fuck is that super telegraphed movement before she gets dropped? like what is she doing? lmao
I remember that. She got super defensive about it when people were calling her out lol.
After the fake glove touch and kick, Nadia rushes in without an attack and hands down..
It's clobberin' time
lol get fucked
Who won the fight?
That is some weasel shit
Instant karma! Seriously though, why would you even try something like that? It's unsportsmanlike and reflects badly on you as a fighter, and everyone who's affiliated with you.
Good ! Not a fan of fighters showing no class
I was at this and 196. Never have I loved seeing two people lose more that her and erick Silva after similar dog moves
Good, you want to play unfair, get your ass kicked!
Her asshole behaviour contoured  and served a  cold KO
Sleazy
Nadia will soon go the way of Colton Smith
r/oddlysatisfying
Every single time I've seen a fighter do this, they always get dropped shortly after.
Lol she not only lost the fight but all respect as well
Kim made her look silly for the whole fight afterwards, outstriking her by a mile despite having pillow hands
Fighters who do this are trash
I could watch this all day
This is r/bettereveryloop God I just love watching her face plant after that left.
I dunno why she‚Äôs still in the ufc tbh. She‚Äôs a very low level fighter, should t have made it out of the local promotions.
Faked the glove touch just to get a little teep in??
You CANT PLAY GAMES IN THE OCTAGON
Well deserved, what a clown.
The fuck was she doing after that kick? She looks unathletic as fuck, not even throwing a punch jus has her arms out
I dont watch MMA nor am I any kind of fighting expert but that lady looks really bad at moving in general.
Would‚Äôve been nice if it was a one punch KO
r/mademesmile
Oh god, it's even better than the headline.

Nadia faked a glove touch and went for a kick, then got faked out by a kick and dropped by a chin touch.
So apparently women are 100% equal in that they can also be total unsportsmanlike douchebags.
Impressive how much she was able to put into that punch with one foot off the ground.
Video of how the fight ended:

https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1180632031769706497
How is this person a UFC level fighter DUDE WHAT
u/yolosweggi you never touch gloves you dog
Nadia Kassem aka Punching bag
r/instantkarma
Such a bitch move. I never liked to touch gloves before a fight, but I told that to the ref and my opponent before the fight. When the bell dinged I make sure my opponent is ready to fight then we meet in the center and fight.
Only fools rush in
It's way more painful to watch how amateurish she looked in that fight.
Jawline made of glass
Things you love to see:
After seeing that weird little stutter step hop punch thing, I‚Äôm really scratching my head as to how she won her first three pro fights via KO/TKO.
Shit like that should mean you're kicked out. No more fights for you. That's such a shitty thing to do.
man fuck that bitch. got what she deserved
s'unathletic
I clicked to see how immediately we were talking and i yea it was immediately as fuck lol
Ryan Hall every time he wins

Everyone has their signature victory move. Mighty Mouse has his arm-swing punch. Johnny Walker has his shoulder-dislocation. Ryan Hall has his bewildered shrug.

MRW I Heel hook a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu world champion : ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Imagine somehow picking up a fight with the most inoffensive looking dude on the planet only to be heel hooked into another plane while he proceeds to look at you with this face.

Edit: cant type
He's a pretty chill martial artist nerd who doesn't seem to have any ego. 

&#x200B;

Also he's made some of the greatest BJJ instructional videos of all time
Unassuming bjj guys are terrifying. Dude looks like he could be selling Scientology to me on the street but really this guy could spinning heel kick me into outer space or ruin my knees worse than Derrick Rose‚Äôs. Apart from basic decency, this is why you can‚Äôt shit talk these plain looking dudes!
Gym Halpert
Toru Yano style haha
I really dig Hall. Watched an interview where he used the words "esoteric" and "transcendancy". He's like the Anti-Tito. Mans is well articulate.
He's confused, his coaches have just been telling him these are live jiu-jitsu seminars all along
‚Äúit really does keep working huh‚Äù
FYI. This guy has Tourette syndrome.

The Sleepy Gary of MMA
I'm still mildly upset that they skipped over his post fight interview. I guess the bald man was screaming from his watch room to cut to commercial
I don't know why the UFC isn't pushing this dude more. He's one of the few non champion newish names that people are actually interested in.
"lol this game plan worked again"
Ryan Hall is much more than a bjj specialist. Love to see him fight!
This like watching Jim react to something Michael Scott said
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you expect? Iminari roll or die.‚Äù
Blinky McHeelhook
I have no fucking idea who Ryan Hall is, how good he is, or even how MMA works, but my headcanon is that this dude wandered on the ring by accident and has been winning through sheer "the fuck am I even doing"ness ever since.
I don't watch MMA, and probably won't start anytime soon, but this guy is now my favorite.
Does he do this on purpose?
https://giphy.com/gifs/BxWTWalKTUAdq
Legit the same reaction I  have when he pulls off a win
Almost 30K upvotes. Ryan Hall is a drawl B.
Can't wait for him to "iunno" to a title
the fight on saturday was the first one of ryan ive seen. (im still catching up with all the fights)  
my jaw dropped. his style is just so entertaining to watch.  
you wouldnt think a guy who looks like he doesnt even care when standing in the octagon can throw such lethal kicks.   
now i know which fighter to binge on fightpass
I hope he has that reaction if he wins the belt
"The fuck did I do?".
Ryan "I'm not the judge" Hall
I fucking love Ryan Hall lol
18.8k upvotes? Now I don't feel alone watching the prelims just for Hall.

How fuckin cool can you you be after heel hooking BJ Penn!? Top level!
Maybe he‚Äôs doing Mickey (from Snatch) shrug https://makeagif.com/i/3A52a6
Hall is probably one of the few fighters I would be willing to bet on not being on some PED.
Guess I'll win - Ryan Hall
That's from The Office (US)
He looks like a guy who started BJJ because it would be easier to pause and take a nap when you're already on the ground.
I thought he was shrugging at the crowd booing in his last fight. I had never noticed he does it after every fight haha
I know nothing about him and have never heard of him before but he definitely looks like some guy who works in a cubicle and should not be winning against the opponents.
I have know Ryan personally for many years,  I believe he was a white belt when we first met. He is one of the nicest, humble, most genuine people I have ever met.
Cue the [Curb Your Enthusiasm theme!](https://youtu.be/Ag1o3koTLWM)
does this man not sweat?
He has the Jim Halpert look down
He rules I want to see more!
I‚Äôm just a little guy
He kind of looks like Werdum.
Love this man
My favorite celebration in the game.
"I dunno I just go out there and roll around and throw kicks and shit.. seems to be working."

Ive never seen a fight before i dont even know what mma stands for but i‚Äôve seen this gif and ive seen that video of him talking articulately and Ryan Hall is now one of my favorite people
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
This is totally me whenever I actually do something right for a change.
He needs to change his walk-in music to the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme.
Oddly enough you can actually tell he was surprised this fight that it was scored so close... It wasn't split, but one of the judges score cards had it at 28-29, and he looks over at his coaches like, "Really? I thought I whooped this dude."
"I don't know man, I just pushed all the buttons and somehow won"

He looks like the type of person to have accidentally got placed in the MMA pro circuit and next thing ya know he's a champion. His wife didn't know where the hell he was too his third pro series win.
He's just a big fan of [Rob Van Dam](https://fteswl.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rvd.png).
You know what Ryan Halls game really reminds me of, Elias Theoderou. The difference being Ryan actually has finishing potential and isn't just trying to win decisions. Like even kick wise he seems to be getting increasingly more dangerous (not just Elkins losing his ability to take a shot). I do think he's gonna face both an athletic and grappling ability ceiling, but I'm here for the ride as long as it lasts.
Me after every argument with my wife. I just slam the bathroom door and look into the mirror and make this exact gesture.
What a good and humble guy
Do you suffer from short term memory loss?

Well, I don‚Äôt remember.

Where am I? What happened...I dunno
This bugs me for some reason.
Reminds me of the "Classic Jim face".
"Oh wow who even knew"
Guess I won ..
Llooll
I hope he makes the exact same expression when he loses
Looks like a dude who accidentally entered a fight and won and just had that repeat over and over

Ryan "Mr. Bean" Hall!!!!!!
Staying humble. True sportsmanship
"Well, I guess I'll win."
i used to dislike the guy because he looks so cocky all the time.

Then I learned he has Tourette Syndrome and some of those things he does are not intentional.

I think a lot differently now. I don't think he'll ever win a belt. His stand up is far too rudimentary (this last fight was an un-ranked guy coming off back to back losses so it was taylor made for Ryan to get to him)

I like Ryan a lot, but once he gets to the top 10 he's not getting much further.

he's extremely bright and really articulate though. watch this

That's really freaking adorable. (I don't watch MMA so I think I can use the word "adorable")
The first one when he smiles with the mouth guard

Going to be very interesting if he stays active and keeps winning. He's got a weird style, but it's effective. Looks like he's worked on his hand striking, and his kicking has been good for a bit. Looking for that inverted butt scoot to leg/heel lock victory to beat Max Holloway for the UFC belt, lol.
Ryan looks like someone picking up a paycheck and finding out they earned 20 hours of overtime.
"Well whaddya know"
He always looks like he got lost and is just gonna go with whatever is happening here
Dude looks like he was all about the fight and not about being the center of attention.
He is the Kawhi Leonard of mma. I bet his family doesn‚Äôt even know he fights.
He looked amazing  I‚Äôm really excited for his future.
Congrats, u/metanoia09  ESPNMMA gave you a shout out on Instagram!

lmao. Omg, I've never noticed this.

It's kinda like "wow.... not sure what just happened" ahahaha
MMA scrub here:

How is his face always so clean and undamaged after every fight?

Does this guy ever take a punch or what?
Khabib posted this on his Instagram in Russian and English.

Hey everyone,

there were a LOT of posts about this as expected, I cleared about 20 dupes out of the thread. This was the first thread posted, and it shows a screencap of the actual post so we're going with it.

Thanks!

Grats OP on snagging the karma, and RIP your inbox.

**Edit:** Just for some clarity, Zubair is Not the one in red. It's NOT the one who hit McGregor from the back. It's the one in black who jumps over the fence after McGregor hits the guy in red.

Idk how dana is going to take this...
Dana: but I posted a bear meme about you, I thought we were good now? 
Khabib to Bellator confirmed. 
Ferguson vs Nurmagomedov will be a battle between two boogeyman. El Cucuy vs Baba Yaga
> I hope it won't get stuck in your throat

Tough line
How do you say bros before hoes in Dagestani russian?
"His legacy is money. My legacy is smash."
Damn, khabib doesn't play games
Conor Vs Khabib 2 - Loser Leaves Town Match
It wouldn't surprise me is khabib left the ufc before we get to see the glorious tony vs khabib fight
The UFC isn‚Äôt holding his money, right? I thought it was NSAC?
The crazy thing is I don't think Khabib is bluffing lol
His Russian post is literally getting 100+ likes per second. Man knows how to stir a pot.
I'll take that 2 mil when it becomes available if he's not interested
We're about to see if Khabib has earned the same clout with the UFC that McGregor has...
good lord just set up a 5v5 and lock the gate. 
Bold move, Cotton.
'member when people said conor was being a good friend to artem? i 'member
#This is number 1 loyalty shit
I love how fighters are realising how much power they have over the UFC now. Excellent stuff 
Damn my wife isn't even that loyal to me
>If you still decide to fire him, don‚Äôt forget to send me my broken contract, otherwise I'll break it myself.


>And one more thing, you can keep my money that you are withholding. You are pretty busy with that, I hope it won‚Äôt get stuck in your throat.

What an absolute boss
[Take that, Conor](https://i.imgur.com/1Ru13ay.gif)
The UFC 229 fallout is some nuclear fallout shit and i am loving it
His fight with Artem will probably do better numbers than many ppvs now lol
This can get reallly tricky. What Zubaira Tukhugov did is definitely warrants him getting - AT VERY LEAST - kicked off his fight with Artem.

This can get really ugly. Khabib playing hardball with UFC is not something I expected, not because of who he is, but for the sake of him being able to fight. Sticking up for his buddy is a noble move, even if most (here) won't see it as such. If anybody other than Conor throws that dolly and what happened happens - they are getting booted from UFC. I don't think it's  a stretch saying that. Conor got preferential treatment, the whole world knows that but what can you do. Well, now Khabib will use their own actions against that, if a sucker punch warrants removal of the fighter from the organization, what consequences are significant enough for something that Conor did? THIS is UFC's nightmare coming to fruition as they are being held accountable of their actions by their champion. 

If Khabib says says Zubaira says stays or we both go, and Conor says fuck that get him out of here, then what?

I'm guessing if Khabib is serious Dana would keep Zubaira on the roster and just cancel the fight. HOWEVER if Conor and his camp jump in to this, this can definitely escalate, and I see no reason why Conor wouldn't do that.

Dana is probably screaming right now 
He's not holding Conor to a different standard to Zubaira and any others who were involved in the brawl/bus incident. He's holding Conor AND Khabib to a different standard. If they weren't stars they would be gone from the UFC. 

Zubaira should absolutely be cut, the only person from Conor's team at the bus incident who has a contract with the UFC was Artem and he did feck all except be there looking horrified and what ended up happening. If he had thrown something at the bus he should be gone too. The difference between what Artem and Zubaira did is big, Zubaira actually threw punches, Artem was just present. That's why Zubaira should be cut and Artem wasn't.

In a fair world Conor and Khabib would be cut too. But it's not a fair world. They're stars so they get treated differently. Their lackeys are not stars.


Monster move mashallah.
While this is a ballsy move by Khabib and shows admirable loyalty, I don't understand why he asks why none of Conor's teammates got fired after the bus incident. The only other UFC fighter there was Artem, whose main contribution was taking a slap and telling Conor, then looking on powerless as Conor and the goons ran amok in the car park. Not quite the same as Tukhugov hitting Conor.

Regardless it's an interesting threat which probably isn't an empty one, and I'll be curious to see if the UFC back down. Much probably won't come of it, a couple of short suspensions maybe to save some face.
Khabib crushed the credibility of UFC's hottest property and now might walk. I like his attitude, tell UFC to fuck themselves and fight somewhere else.
The UFC isn't holding your money, the NSAC is.
Big dick energy
DAmn, Khabib been all jokes with Dana then turns around and slaps him in the face with this. Russian cold.
Worst possible scenario is Khabib eventually mauling Dildo Denis in bellator. #Smesh
[deleted]
Fuck, not even a Khabib fan, but the dude has some massive balls 
Khabib and his boys are legit squadgoals
Paul Daley got fired for hitting Koscheck in the octagon, Zubaira doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

Conor didn't get punished by the UFC for the dolly incident, Khabib isn't gonna get punished by the UFC for this either.

I'm not saying it's right, but I mean... It's fair. Don't cheap shot someone on live TV.
Khabib vs MacDonald confirmed
While I do agree with him, aren‚Äôt most of the sanctions based on the NSAC? 
Khabib vs Ben Askren in Bellator, HYPED!
Now this is gonna be interesting, will Dana give in or is he actually going to cut one of the most dominant MMA fighters in UFC history in Khabib. Myself, I'd love to see Artem vs Zubaira and even more so after recent events. Hope the fight is still on the table if they keep Zubaira.  
Oh no. Now the ufc will look like a real bitch company if they comply. I doubt Khabib is bluffing
Because Artem didn‚Äôt throw anything and Cian Crowley who did throw something is signed to Brave FC. No one else in that group was signed to the UFC.
The goof does not respond well to power moves. There goes any hope of things being swept under the rug
Both sides are undefendable, Conor's attack was bad, Khabib thinks he just jumped at one dude, but he could've started a deadly Riot.    


Fuck all of those people.
The lack of remorse in this post is probably a mistake when Nevada still has his money and are probably scheduling a hearing.
Nah man.  Whether anyone likes to admit it, different rules for different levels of fighters.  If a middling fighter had thrown the dolly they'd be gone.  If a middling fighter had jumped the fence and attacked coaches they'd be gone.  A middling fighter jumping a main event star isn't going to get mercy.  Had Artem been the one to toss the dolly he would not be working for the UFC anymore.
It's not UFC withholding his money is it?
Artems fight got cancelled too and Artem didnt punch anyone. He was just there. Zubaira punched Conor at a sanctioned event. Also Khabib will not get any punishment from the UFC, just like Conor got no punishment from the UFC. Khabib will be punished by the state of Nevada, just as Conor was punished by the state of NY. I dont see Danas actions as unfair.
>We have defended our honor and that is the most important thing.

Rockhold has taught Khabib the way of the samurai. 
Realest person in the fight game
Although apparently genuine, the end result was pretty much identical to WWE promotion...The best thing Dana can do would probably be to just roll with it, reap the profits, and make an effort to ensure it doesn't repeat...that's  if he does indeed care about the UFC image in the way that he claims, and if the WWEness of this incident wasn't intentional, like it surely was with the corny lesnar/cormier altercation after the cormier vs miocic fight....
Khabib attacked Dillon Danis who wasnt even in NY when the bus attack happened, so how exactly he is "finishing it" also, is he concussed? He ganged up on Artem Lobov, so technically he started the whole thang.
Meanwhile Danis is shitting his pants cause he knows if Khabib leaves UFC he's coming for that lil bitch in Bellator
Didn‚Äôt Artem get his fight cancelled in Brooklyn after the bus incident?
This is turning out to be a lose-lose for everyone. 
To everyone hating on Zubair-> 
Zubair is Not the one in red.
Its's NOT the one who hit mcgregor from the back.
It's the one in black who jumps over the fence after mcgregor hits his team mate. He goes to check on him and sees he got hit. Meanwhile McGregor is calling him:Zuu! Zuu! (it's his nickname)  Zubair comes to him and they both try punching eachother. McGregor connects at his armpit. Zubair grazes his cheek.

It's not fair if he gets punished but not McGregor.
They are both at fault. 
Wow, even Khabib thinks that the octagon walls make the two fights separate events lol
One hour, 2351 comments 

This is not going to be pretty 
this whole thing has been massively disappointing as someone who just likes to watch Khabib fight. he's gonna be suspended, he doesn't grasp the concept of ignoring loudmouth shit talkers, we aren't allowed to talk about x, y, or z unless we have something good to say, now he's gonna retire if they punish a guy who, in whatever context you wanna put it, made his own choice and Khabib's career is objectively worth so much more than his. this he said she said childlike arguing is fucking mind numbing. just being honest. 
Khabib is hypocrite. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm a fan of his but he does have a victim complex. He uses everything Conor did to defend his actions but in the same breathe complains how they crossed the line over and over. Conor and Khabib are the same, they both crossed the line which is why Conor didn‚Äôt press charges he doesn‚Äôt condemn what they did because he is no better. The only difference is Khabib constantly pretends that he is holier then thou and that he did nothing wrong. Sorry but you can‚Äôt jump a guy outside the cage and then point the finger and say but they said mean things. Khabib talked shit too and he also was the first to confront artem with a team of guys. As far as I am concerned they are two sides of the same coin. 
[deleted]
That's the problem, you can't do insane shit like jumping in the cage when you are some random fighter. You have to earn those priviledges.
khabib is a loyal guy and so is Conor, its better that this matter gets solved without any of them getting pulled out off MMA cuz if rematch happens it will be a great chance for both of them to solve this all and turn this into friendly atmosphere. 
The best part of this.. "just because he hit Conor"  I could not help but laugh at that.  I got the tone of "Hey, we should be smacking Conor, what gives man!?"

But other than that, Khabib does not play around.  Sticking to his guns, as shitty as the situation was at the time, gotta give him credit for that.
None of Conor's team that were involved in the bus incident are even UFC fighters and it was mostly Conor to blame for that, none of Conor's team have ever attacked a fighter after a fight that guy deserves to be kicked out.
I really wanna see khabib and Ferguson. But wasn't the bus thing Connors retaliation to something khabibs guys did to Connors teammate? 
In a way, I can respect it. But it's a pretty stupid thing to do.

(His response, not attacking people outside of the ring, that was really stupid too) 
conor really fucked up by losing. he turned dude into some kind of martyr.
Would hate to see him go but gotta respect his loyalty 
also, I guess khabib doesn't understand how athletic associations work.  Dana isn't holding his money, and when the ppvs money comes in, he will prob get whatever cut of it that they agreed upon.
If your only argument is "We defended our honor and the other guys started first", you're probably wrong.

BUT! Qualifier: McGregor and Khabib are both unprofessional idiots, so it's kind of a given. Certainly will create a lot more cash for both of them in the future so.. win win?
Bellator about to make serious moves.
Everyone complaining about Conor getting preferential treatment like as if this isnt a business decision... same thing with Jones really. What are you gunna do, not put your biggest attraction in a fight? Martial artist will say dont but entertainment will say "wtf are you crazy??" 

I mean look at the positives that conor DOES bring... he created a stage where dozens of other fighters also got bigger because of being on the same card as him. Derick lewis alone should be example of this. 

The martial artist in me says to get rid of all these cheating, foul mouthed losers who are disrespecting the sport. The other side of me says, "holy shit that was crazy, when is the next event???" 

Khabib probably isnt bluffing here because he takes shit personally but even at one point in their press conference, Conor  says "come on, let's build this up" it's not just an intimidation factor but it's how to grow  your brand and maximize your profits.
**Some men just want to watch the goof burn.**
To the GOOFCON bunker! Every man for themselves.
His actions after the fight weren‚Äôt those of someone who planned on fighting in the UFC again, I‚Äôm sad to say.
UFC is literally the WWE twenty years ago, but with social media added to it. We are working ourselves in to a shoot brother
-HH
Tony vs Khabib pleeeease
Integrity and loyalty. Two words Dana White does not know the definition of.
That's when you witness that khabib has a serious problem.. He should ease the fuck up. First of all, even Dana said that holding back his whole purse wasn't fair. The guy is uptight and bitter.  He won he got everything he wanted connor on his knees begging him to let go and he had it in a beautiful way.. Now about honor you surely understands that giving credit to stupid and harmful things said by other human beings isn't something you want in life because you loose your freedom and you have to go to war each time someone insults you.
He should contact Fedor and ask for some advices. His feelings are hurt despite the win and this isn't good news for him 
Words aren't the same as fists flying. No one in Connor's camp was there during that bus shit, and Conor faced criminal charges. I just cannot respect anyone who thinks insults warrant attacks. Grow the fuck up. 
#This is #1 Hespec
Khabib 3:16 
Yeah.. I don't like the emphasis on "Honor" in those religions/nations/people too much. Because it leads to most people taking everything sooo fkin serious.

Most comments I read so far are talking about what a great man Khabib is for doing this. And you're probably right at least in this context. It's an honorable thing to do.

Things like this just immediately remind me of stuff like "Honor killings" and the likes. And those traditions just make me sick.
He right about the bus incident. Like any other job you would be fired right away.
If this is how Khabib goes out I'll be disappointed as fuck, but I will respect him til my dying day.

Also, KHABIB TO RIZIN LET'S DO IT SAKAKIBARA 
I'm pretty sure Dana is done with Khabib

&#x200B;

I wouldn't want to see a rematch tbh
Everyone that calls Khabib a boring fighter should really just stop pretending they enjoy MMA and go watch some worldstar fight comps.
I‚Äôm hearing alot of ‚Äúnobody from conors camp helped in the bus incident‚Äù 

Pretty sure conor had his employees ‚Äúthe Mac life‚Äù crew use their press passes to gain access into the building so they could open doors that weren‚Äôt meant to be opened for conor and his 40 cronies. Given that Conor or any of his boys weren‚Äôt on the card they were trespassing to commit a violent act against innocent folks sat in a bus. Not a single one of those people should be allowed near a UFC event again and that might be a big part of Khabibs issue. 

These Mac life turds were still allowed to film at 229, that in its self is an injustice.

Edit II: Hello /r/all! 

This is a clip of a fight ending sequence that occurred at this past weekend's Bellator 221. The original reaction thread can be found [here](/r/MMA/comments/bnkgcx/spoiler_bellator_221_douglas_lima_vs_michael/), and our live discussion thread for the event can be found [here](/r/MMA/comments/bnlh5n/official_bellator_221_chandler_vs_pitbull/). We do tons of live event threads each week - if you're into MMA consider joining us next time.

As others have said, the clip above is not edited - it happened exactly as shown. If you look closely the fight was reffed by an Asgardian who goes by the name of "Mike Beltran" when on Midgard.
I think this might have been photoshopped. I can tell by the pixels and the fact that I‚Äôve seen quite a few photoshops in my day
HE WENT FOR THE HEAD!
Haven't posted here in a while! I'm back so expect many more of these to come.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all the Silver, Gold and Platinum love!
The way mvp falls over is one of the most hilarious knockouts in a while
Mods pls don‚Äôt do it
Your creativity is ridiculous man and the edits are getting cleaner and cleaner like wtf
You know this is a legit af video when you saw it on Lima‚Äôs Facebook before you see it on Reddit
That's fucking illegal. More illegal than the time OSP's corner threw a skateboard into the Octagon so Shogun would slip
***MAMA MJOLNIR!***
[our boy is back!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/50eynt/i_made_a_gif_of_donald_cerrone_going_super_saiyan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
That‚Äôs against mma rules
Why would anyone report this?  This is awesome content that actually takes effort.
Alternative title: Brazilian smashes Ebony with no lube.
Wow , this is actually pretty good. Hehe
One of the best KOs I can remember. It legitimately makes up for all the Bellator events that panned out in a comically terrible way. Makes me sad that he has a W over Daley, but at least the MVP hype/promotion can come back to Earth after that decap.
The legend returns.
You're a fucking ~~punk~~ wizard dude. And some of these would be awesome for a Thiago Santos finish.
This is so fucking dope
Is this Blender?
Hahaha this was awesome
/r/supersaiyangifs
#CapeShitOnly
To the front page with you
I think it's awesome that Douglas Lima is getting some props because he's a beast and has been for many years now.
This is so amazing
Stoked this is hitting the front page the week after the fight as opposed to 6 months later.
This might be the best edit I‚Äôve seen yet
He is worthy
Mamma mia, Douglas Lima!
That was well done!!
I usually don‚Äôt like MMA edits, but this is fucking sweet
Your posts are awesome. Why can‚Äôt I follow you?
There has to be a subreddit devoted to this kinda thing, can someone tell me what it is?
i love his nonchalant celebration
Beltran as the ref makes it seems like this is an Asgardian sanctioned death match. I love it.
r/SuperSaiyanGIFs
Op should post this to r/highqualitygifs
Are people actually upset over this gif? I think its pretty fucking cool
I never saw it from this angle. Crazy to think that they allow their fighters to summon weapons in Bellator. You can't even hit someone in the back of the head in UFC.

#/s

Kidding of course. This is the illness post this week. Cheers!
Crazy thing is watching this live I didn't even notice mjolnir
That last bit of ground and pound now looks even more viscous now
If you reported this for being "cringe", you should probably go outside more often. Feels like we're forgetting what the definition of "cringe" is.
Wow that's fucking cool!
This is so fuckin nasty
This is instant mma gif hof material.

Well done, giffer.  Well done.
This is so good
It‚Äôs hammer time
What the Frick? That's amazing
2 brutal
Rayrod you are the God of Goofs
This is insane
How did you go about achieving those speedramps?
The best part is the commentator screaming Mama Mia!
I read the title and for a second thought Master Chief was going to come flying out of the sky
10/10
holy fuck, that ref has the end-game of all end-game tiers of mustache
well done. and now we know why those strikes are called hammer fists.
Baddass
Bless whoever made this
Woah
Yall ruthless, LOLOL this shit is hilarious

&#x200B;

Would had like to see the gauntlet on MVP
FATALITY!!
I dint follow mma but this edit is fking GLORIOUS!
The last thing you want when KO'd is the refs dwarf beard in your face
Epic
That was an excellent leg sweep and followup, dude went horizontal on the way down
Refree should cancel this match for using unwanted  material
Still stronger than endgame Thor :(
how do people do these edits
Man that leg kick totally caught MVP off-guard. Great timing.
wow they‚Äôre letting weapons in the ring now ? this sport is really going to shit
Douglas Lima was still Worthy
Imagine saying Thor in a Brazilian accent üòÇ
Link doesn't work anymore
No lie, watching that douche venom get lit up was the best
This question is out of left field but what programs are used to make these effects? Is it photoshop still?
Love it...  Great job.  You have a future in graphics.
Let him borrow it, glad he used it well
I love those wooowwww
That. Is. Amazing.
Yup. This is dope
are 12 to 6 Mjolnir's legal?
/r/SuperSaiyanGifs would appreciate this as well
This reminds me so much of the old school early 2000 WWE replays, damn. That was awesome.
I linked this on twitter and Douglas Lima liked it 

Killer job!
Yo this is so sick. I hope it doesn‚Äôt get removed ü§ûüèº
Why do these types of cuts jack me up in the same way I used to get fired up watching the Dragonball Z fight scenes as a kid
I like it
Is this a deleted scene from Endgame???
that's fake
Shoulda used that big axe from infinity war/endgame lol
When the Dwarf Referee has seen enough of the Hammer it must be over.
to the top you go
Awesome
This is Amazing... Good job OP
OMG this is amazing. Please make one of Rose vs. Andrade. Maybe Andrade can be Wasp and do the shrink/enlarge move into the head slam.
Perfect
/u/Barklehh
You could say that he got hammered.
Rarely am I sad to have missed Bella fights.

This is that exact rare occasion.
this is so fucking well made. fantastic job.
I knew it
I knew it!
I thought you weren't allowed to hit someone who had a knee down. Am I misremembering that?
I knew it!
Nothing like watching a cocky fighter getting knocked the fuck out.
I'm still worthy!
this is incredibly well done.
How long did this take you?!?!?!
I"m serious. How Long?
This is fantastic!!!
Jesus Christ.

He actually aimed for the head.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating
Super Saiyan Miguel Ernesto Aguirre is still the highest benchmark, but still awesome.
Fucking hell I don't even watch MMA but this would make me start.
ELI5: how do people do this, and how much time does it take?
More please, that was great
very cool
This is going to be with this community for the foreseeable future. I fucking love it.
Quick, precise, maybe hes born with the talent. Maybe its Mjolnir
One of the great gifs of all time
Now make a Super Saiyan one!
Where can I find more of these
This is so sick
Damn this was dope
God that is so well done that it actually made me wince in pain even though its not real. Perfect job.
lol
I think that's cheating
Should have made it so the hammer tripped Page on its way to Lima's hands
What does this mean for non dweebs?
That doesn't look regulation
I don't even watch MMA but I could tell from the second the video played who was going to get knocked the fuck out.

Thoughts and prayers.
Is there a sub for edited mma fights like this?
Is this real?
This is my new favorite thing.
This is dope
I thought they meant mjolnir armor :'(
Original?
I KNEW IT!
It was cool how Page was using that skipping right to cover for the kick to Lima‚Äôs lead leg, and it was even cooler how Lima picked up on it (literally) to land that takedown and to prematurely cut off his exit with his own kick.
This is so fucking good.
I like this. More please
S√°ZaZwszq
this is actually dope
Is this legal? Is this an nba ref?? How did he not see that
How and where do I learn to make this

He loose some teeth?

haha
This sums up in one video why I love the internet.
Dopeness
I'd totally watch MMA if it had special effects like this üòÇ
This is funny
Sound is turned off but I can still hear the smashes. Nice work.
That's what the dude gets for thinking he is Anderson Silva
That‚Äôs some amazing work, Bravo!!
Amazing. Having the Beard Beltran there is a nice cherry in the cake.
U better make one for mahetta soon
what lol? uhm, i like it!
Smh.

Did MVP do ANY homework on Lima?  He presented his lead leg in an awkward stance to one of the best Lake kickers in the game today on a silver platter
Why is this the greatest thing I've ever seen?
This is so dope.
Is there a subreddit for gifs and vids that are like this?
Um. When did this happen??  Did i miss it because of this new dumbass DAZN bs??
r/noisygifs
u/vredditdownloader
This is incredible, mad props
I love you
This is amazing
Ood
This finish reminded me so much of Weidman vs Silva.
i always love seeing these.. sicccckkkk!!!
Currently The third highest liked post in R/MMA history and its Bellator :). Well done to man this looks better than some effects of blockbuster movies.
Where can I find more of these?
Breddy gud
Could‚Äôve started the gif with MVP donning the gauntlet
u/rayrod747 does it again!
lol this is very well done
Wow! I thought that title was just a figure of speech.
I wish that he fought thanks wouldn't have been as hard for the avengers
OMG!!!! I Love this!!!
Have watched this like 100 times. The lack of reaction straight away is so epic
This... But no irony what so ever or undermining this fucking post cause it's awesome AF.
Hello user sorting by  ‚ÄúTop All Time‚Äù!
Nice job!
Ok, now that's cool
Dope edit
Bring me Venom!!
Should have spun the hammer like in endgame
I think we found who should REALLY be the new Captain America.
So Douglas Lima is worthy??
Apex mma meme!
Honestly, I think it would have been better just starting at the leg kick. The hammer flying in kind of killed some of it.
Straight to the top!
I think that's cheating
Great work!
Amazing !!
Kewwl
Fantastic work!
This is amazing.
This is unbelievable, incredible job man!
Lol, fantastic
damn
This is the goat edit!!
Was MVP the kid that Thor was yelling at while playing Fortnite?
This is so badass.
This is the best edit I‚Äôve ever seen. Props to the man who posted.
This is gold
Amazing
I'm worthy, bitch!
Most accurate gif ever
Mighty hammer
Okay this is awesome. Quality content
Fantastic
This is the coolest shit I‚Äôve seen in a while
WORTHY
i love these
He went for the head.
r\fightedits
I'm literally commenting just so I can say I was part of this greatness. Truly in awe.
Fucking FRESH!
Hey man, you‚Äôre pretty good at this. Awesome work buddy
I think that's cheating.
MAMA MIA! Mauro Ranallo is an incredible commentator.
So he cheated
Coolest GIF i ever seen üëè
Is this whole fight behind PPV? i wanna see it but i cant find it anywhere!
Pretty sure that‚Äôs an illegal maneuver . But I could be wrong

This was glorious finish. Hopefully it doesn't affect MVP's ego too much.
Another fucking awesome gif. Welcome back!

Other guy seems very scrawny lol
look I dont know much about MMA but that can't be legal
This is why don't dance around like a fool in front of a professional fighter even if you are/were undefeated and a bad man in your own right.
It's called Mj√∂lnir for pete's sake. I wish i knew an example of √∂ sound being used in english but i cant think of any at the moment.

As much as I hate Bellator, this looked cool.. not as cool as the UFC ones tho üòéüòé
Two types of fighters

UFC gonna end up paying Lewis 1 million
Ngannou has lost twice in the UFC.  He just avenged his first loss leaving only one man who has beaten him.  That man is Derrick Lewis, who easily dispatched him in what was widely hailed as the fight of the decade.
Jons best negotiating tactic would be to sit in a room with Dana and the matchmakers and force everyone to watch Lewis Ngannou 1.
I can literally read derricks tweet and hear his voice in my head
Lots of people are saying 8-10M is reasonable ask from Jones. But the way the tweet is worded, it sounds like they offered 8-10M and he turned it down? Am I incorrect in assuming that?
This whole money situation with Jon is very conflicting for me.

On the one hand, fuck Jon. On the other hand, fuck Dana.
Keeping his balls cooled at all times ain‚Äôt free y‚Äôall.
It‚Äôs just kinda dumb to me that Jon and the UFC didn‚Äôt come to an agreement prior to him vacating the LHW belt and gaining weight. I 100% thought that was the case when he made it clear he was moving to heavyweight, but now I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs an idiot for not at least using the belt as leverage to make a deal.
I will never hate a man for trying to get what hes worth. Theres 20 boxers making over 10 million per fight this year with half the viewers as UFC gets and yet they refuse to pay anyone not named McGregor.
I'm just happy to see how much he's actually chasing money wise.
Aaaand there‚Äôs a perfect example of why fighters have no negotiation power and why they need a union
MMA fighters are getting screwed in general in terms of payment. Jones has gotten one of the few superfights available at the heavier weight classes right in front of him, this is basically the only time he can negotiate for a proper pay day and be taken seriously. And Dana preempted this and played the ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt really want the fight‚Äù card to get Jon to accept the fight for peanuts out of pride. 

A boxer with a legacy like Jones would be paid twice what he‚Äôs asking at the bare minimum. Jones may be a scumbag, but for what he and all fighters sacrifice physically it‚Äôs bullshit that they can be bullied out of earning their worth. He‚Äôs dead right to hold out and make some real money after dedicating his life to this shit.
I wish Dana would release some of the UFC's balance sheets, would love to see what % fighters are actually getting paid, how much the UFC is netting, and what kind of expenses the UFC has
I have to agree with Jones here. That reconstruction surgery is going to be hella expensive
Lewis on that Art of the Deal type shit lmao
If this were boxing $8-10 million would be a pretty low ask. I applaud Jon and anyone else who tries to get paid what they're worth. No reason UFC fighters and boxers who sell similar amounts of ppvs shouldn't be paid similarly.  


And I say this as someone who thinks Jon should be banned for life from the sport over his PED use
Yeah rich ones and poor ones
"that's all that's been discussed so far"

yet it still lead him to say how he's having his life ruined and they should cut him from the organisation?

maybe have some more discussions?
I personally think Bones has been of couple of competent judges away from not being worth near that number for a couple of fights now.

He very arguably lost to a crippled Santos, definitely lost to Reyes, and ducked out of the division because he knew it wasn‚Äôt getting any easier. We see flashes of the old Jones once every several fights, but he has more of a Mayweather approach to the game now. Except not as effective and with no personality attached to it outside of being a sociopath.

I think he deserves more, but I also think he‚Äôs at a career low point of interest, dominance, and leverage. So why would now be the time where he finally makes big money? I‚Äôm personally more interested in watching an active Francis clean out the division and become a larger than life force. Give me a decent card and a Francis fight and I‚Äôll pay to watch that guy separate himself from everyone else just like Georges and Anderson did
Is Jones talking $8-10 million overall or is he asking for $8-10 million fight purse + PPV points on top of that l?

If its the first one, then that seems an extremely reasonable demand, but if its the later, then there's no way the UFC will give him that. 

Conor McGregor is the biggest star in the UFC and he "only" got a $5 million fight purse for the Poirier fight. Jones is never going to get $8-10 million as a fight purse and expect PPV points added to that. Dana will never agree to that.
I'll do it for 7 million
Two types of bank accounts.
Ill do it for $4 and a return flight home after
And the ducking begins
Bro i get the Jon Jones hate but you cant deny his resume. 

He deserves north of ten million to get in there and get mauled by Francis.
[removed]
I love Lewis. He seems like a good dude that walks around with dynamite in his hands, proving jiujitsu is fake and looking for somewhere to cool his balls off.
For those counting. That‚Äôs roughly 1,603,206 bags of ice at Cosco at $4.99 for a 20 pounder, to keep Derrick‚Äôs balls cool. If we convert that to total weight. That‚Äôs 32,064,128.3 lbs of ice. And or 14544043.94758 kilograms, depending on your preference.
And once again, Derrick Lewis is the funniest guy in the room
Fuckin' Derrick ü§£
Ngannou Lewis 2 it is
Jones needs to get paid, but shit if he‚Äôs scoffing at 10m he may as well just announce his retirement now lol. Dana ain‚Äôt giving him half of that
I get why people hate jones, but he has every right to demand that much money for a superfight. Other sports pay bums 40 million a year to ride the bench while this dude is literally the best mma fighter of all time going up to face the scariest fighter of all time for the heavyweight belt.
Lol, JJ think he's Conor or something?
Is 10 mil really low balling for this fight?

I guess a little bit. Maybe like 15 - 20 mil is more the range.

But this is not gona do khabib vs conor numbers imo so its not a 50 mil fight the way jones seems to be hinting.
To be fair Jon should get 15 million.
It's fucked how little MMA fighters get, but this is just an "opportunity" after all.
I want to see the fight but Jon's not really put on a good performance for a while now, I wonder if he's overestimating his value. Or maybe I'm underestimating how big a name he is. But either way, I don't see this selling enough to get him paid more than Conor.

I'm all for fighters getting more pay, but I'm more interested in seeing the bottom end of the pay scale raised rather than the ceiling being raised for the few who are already millionaires.
u/JakTravis_u_SOB

Brings back memories. Lewis defeated Francis with one little baby kick back in Vegas. There should be re-match. Lewis vs Francis
No interest in seeing the cheating eye-poker fight ever again.
Jones thinks ngannou is Floyd vs Conor magnitude. All this shit for a fight that‚Äôll end in 21 seconds.
Jon's a scumbag and yes he deserves top money for a fight like this, but I still think he's purposely pricing himself out of this fight. If he was offered 15 mill he would still turn it down, everyone knows his weird ass mind games and tactics. He always tries to play victim.
Derrick Lewis is a national treasure
Jon just wants the massive pay say since he knows he will be in the hospital after the fight.
How much was Stip√© payed?
UFC 259 sold 800k buys and had 4 champions split PPV points 

800k x $70 is 56 million 

If it was fair, split it 60-40, 40 going to the ufc and 60 going to the Champions on a tier based approach.

That's $33,600,000 split amongst 4 champions 

80% amongst the main event or $26,880,000 
70-30 split 
Izzy $18,760,000 
Jan $8,040,000

And 20% or $6,720,000 between Nunes and Yan

Nunes 70-30 
She walks away with $4.7million and Petr gets the remaining $2m 

A clean $22,400,000 million from ppv alone for the ufc plus the espn deal is structured in a way where they only have to hit a certain number and they're guaranteed payment from the broadcast giant 

The atheltes probably walked away with peanuts compared to the revenue they generated.
It‚Äôs a million PPV seller, easy, and the biggest fight the UFC can make ... Francis and Jon deserve as much as humanly possible and then ten percent more.
UFC will make way more than 8 million for this fight. They won't do it.

Fans shouldn't blame Jon. Absolutely all the blame should go towards Dana White and the UFC.
Derrick Lewis so grimy I love itü§£
I don't think Jon is the draw he thinks he is
[removed]
Triple threat match
Jones Ngannou is gonna be a really highly watched fight and it‚Äôs likely gonna end with Jones losing. Not surprising he wants more.
Jon Jones saying SHOW ME THE MONEY can just be interpreted as a cop-out for when he doesn't get what he wants. 

Another one of "god's tests" for Jonesy, I guess.
Imagine ufc giving in and giving Jones more $ just to have him test positive and back out of the fight...you know..like the other three times?
That's pathetic. I feel like JJ will become the new king of cringe by the end of these negotiations
Jones thinks he's' Mcgregor or something. Does Jones even hold a ppv record ?
Jon about to price himself to an early retirement. See ya later, pal.
‚ÄúWow Jon Jones is being screwed over by Dana White this is an outrage‚Äù

‚ÄúWow Lewis is so cool for taking the fight and not caring about money‚Äù

üòê
I feel like all this Twitter whiny shit is just for him to see how much money he  can actually make, I feel like he‚Äôd actually be fine with 8-10mil
Stipe didn‚Äôt even get 800k against Francis. What a shambolic sport. Heavyweight champion defense bout. Lol
What makes them think UFC is coughing up this kinda moneyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ngannou:. Wrestles successfully.

Jones: "pLeaSe cuT mE!!!!"
Fuck Jon Jones, Ngannou V Lewis II BOOK IT
Look I'm all for jon getting more money because he deserves it but sheesh 8 mil????? Conor made like 5 mil to show for dustin. I dont think anyone should be asking for more money than conor since nobody can bring in as many ppv buys.
Sounds like he doesn't want the fight
They need to forget Jon Jones and let Lewis have this one. Jones has been nothing but drama since Saturday. He‚Äôs asking for a lot of money
BRO BONES ISNT WORTH OVER 10 MILLION NO WAY
Jon continues to price himself out of this matchup. How convenient!
8 Million too low... I know y‚Äòall gonna disagree with me but that seems like really good money?
MMA fighters are underpaid but I would just cut jon Jones it‚Äôs only a matter of time before he implodes psychologically (again)
Mcgregor sells 1.3 at least every PPV and he doesn‚Äôt get that much bruh
The type that Dana White loves, and the type who wants to get paid what he deserves
Yeah one who is an undefeated champ with a string of defenses and one who isn't.

Anyone who thinks Jones shouldn't get paid stupid money to go up in weight to fight someone like Francis is crazy.
Love Derrick
Get derrick the fight.
Jon Bones Jones arrested for DWI, negligent use of a firearm

In these times, this somehow feels comforting
As is tradition.
Not even a fucking plague can stop this man from finding a way to fuck his life up. All he had to do is stay the fuck home for a bit.
This seems totally out of character for him.
Are we sure his blood alcohol levels weren‚Äôt just pulsing from his last DWI?
The king is back baby
How many times is God gonna test this guy?
Article text for those who can't access the site because of region:



ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. ‚Äî
Mixed Martial Arts fighter Jon ‚ÄúBones‚Äù Jones was arrested on charges of driving under the influence, negligent use of a firearm and possession of an open counter early Thursday morning.

According to a criminal complaint, officers responded to the area of 3rd Street and Central Avenue just after 1 a.m. in reference to gunshots fired. When they arrived they found Jones inside his vehicle with the engine on. Jones told police he did not know anything about the shots fired.

Officers noticed signs of intoxication and police say Jones admitted to officers that he had been driving earlier and intended to drive now.

Police say Jones consented to a sobriety test and performed poorly on it. Police add that when he was given a Breathalyzer he tested at least twice above the legal limit.

After Jones was arrested police found a black handgun under the driver‚Äôs seat and a half-empty bottle of Recuerdo 750ml behind the passenger seat.

Jones was charged with aggravated DWI, negligent use of a firearm and possession of an open container.

This is the fighter‚Äôs second DWI and he was arrested last year on battery charges.
To be clear: the video in the link above [is from 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vVRbN9WeME) when got ticketed for drag racing.

More on the recent arrest from the [Albuquerque Journal's articke](https://www.abqjournal.com/1436836/jon-bones-jones-charged-with-dwi.html):

> The 32-year-old UFC light heavyweight champion was charged with DWI, negligent use of a weapon, possession of an open container and no insurance after police say they found him in Downtown Albuquerque in a running vehicle early Thursday morning.

> According to a criminal complaint filed in Metropolitan Court, a little after 1 a.m. two Albuquerque Police Department officers heard gunshots near 3rd and Central. When they arrived they **said they saw ‚Äútwo unknown homeless subjects‚Äù and a black Jeep**, which was on but in park.

> Jones was in the driver‚Äôs seat, according to the complaint. It is **unclear if the homeless people were in the Jeep or how they were connected to the incident**.

> ‚ÄúI observed that he had blood shot watery eyes and a strong odor of alcohol coming from his facial region,‚Äù the DWI officer wrote in the complaint. ‚ÄúHe did admit to driving earlier and had the intention to drive now.‚Äù

> Jones exited the Jeep and performed poorly on three field sobriety tests, according to the complaint. His breathalyzer test was ‚Äúat or above twice the legal limit,‚Äù the officer wrote. And a black handgun and a half empty bottle of mezcal were also found in the Jeep, according to the complaint.

I can imagine 2 scenarios:

1. A drunken Jon Jones is out at 1am trying to score crack and a blumpkin when a cop rolls up on the scene and busts him;

2. A concerned Jon Jones is out at 1am making sure there aren't any homeless in the street. He finds two homeless people fraternizing. Jones cautions them to find shelter and keep a distance from each other. The three get along nicely, especially with this kind, wealthy attractive man showing genuine care for their well-being. They offer Jones a swig of Mezcal, and Jones, not wanting to be [rude and cowardly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsfnuyyjaB0), takes some large swigs out of courtesy from the safety of his car. Suddenly a cop notices this peaceful congregation and naturally investigates, harassing Jones in the process and further fueling this twisted media narrative of Jones being a shady person.
Yay! 2020 might be coming back to normal again.
dana is going to have a fucking stroke
Water is wet, and jon Jones is tested
"Things can't get any worse." - Dana White

This asshole has been posting tweet after tweet with advice on how to use your time wisely during quarantine.
Im surprised the Abq police arent on ufc payroll to not touch him
In a crazy world, it's nice to know that some things are as they have always been.
Jesus is the hardest matchmaker in history.
LMAOOO NO WAY
Wow, I would not have expected this from Jon Jones.  He is a pretty standup guy.  Those stories of him stealing milky way bars in a grocery store are false.
Imagine hit-and-running a pregnant lady while intoxicated and not having enough remorse to never do it again. 

This man truly is a piece of shit.
They should publish his BAC in picograms per ml
The legal system will be notified that these are simply tests from god. Jon will walk away with a slap on the wrist.
Death, taxes, Jon Jones* ruining his own life.
Hey pussy are you still drunk?
C'mon he was just pulsing,  leave the man be.
hes genuinely a piece of shit
when you realize he was drinking masvidals tequila üòÇüòÇüòÇ
All this dude had to do was stay home. What the fuck
Jon decided to fight corona with corona.
I just fucking lol'd hard. Literally what the fuck man, stop fucking driving drunk you are the champ of the fucking world lol
My mans going to jail

Jon Jones: Hold my firearm.
Get off your high horses, I mean we‚Äôve all had nights where we drank way too much, drove while hanging out our window firing our gun screaming Yippe Ki Yay mother fuckers!

Yeah.. I mean.. me neither..
Has anyone told Jon that for the price of a couple vials of T-Bol, an eight ball of coke, or a few lap dances, he could get an Uber instead?
I'm not surprised motherf******

LOL wtf man, just take away his license forever, how many DUIs can you get before doing this dumb shit over and over
Jon, what a guy, doing his part to normalize 2020
If you ever forget the world isn‚Äôt fair remember Jon Jones beat Daniel Cormier.
Not only was he driving while under the influence and used a firearm negligently, but he did so while we are all supposed to be quarantined.

Damn you Jon. You can‚Äôt get drunk and fire your weapon at home like the rest of us? Shame on you, you selfish son of a bitch.
But I thought he was REFORMED?!?!?!


Hahahhahaa

Is it time to upgrade GOOFCON LEVEL?!
[deleted]
Dude is a certified narcissist. Addicted to alcohol/drugs, attention seeking, thinks that rules do not apply to him, hides behind "religion", portrays himself as confident, but behind his mask is a weak insecure child, you see his confidence gone when he can't hide behind his steroids, afraid to fight Stipe because of his own legacy. To be precise, he is a covert narcissist.
This is insane lmao. Main stream athlete, lots of options for recreation, and he still just gets buzzed and drives around packing.
Thiago vs Reyes for the vacant title makes sense if they strip Jones
Isn't Recuerdo that stuff Gambred is pushing?
I can't wait to hear Rogan try to justify him saying "he's just a wild man,he does wild stuff!"

This guy is just dumb as fucking rocks
Overall cool dude
Fuck this guy, I hope he goes to prison for years, and is given another lengthy suspension. Complete danger to society. Glad to know we got that criminal Nick Diaz out of the sport though. Remind me, what did he do again?
Where are the people who said he has changed at? lol
fucking typical
Good to know that in these chaotic times theres still some consistency in the world.
Ashlee: I'm getting the most negative press this week!

Jon: Hold my beer. (Actually I'm going to keep the beer, watch though.)
Somebody check on Dana White. Take all the sharp objects away from his reach.
I can‚Äôt fucking stand this clown.  He props himself on this moral high ground, always saying something religious.  I don‚Äôt believe in god, but I find it scummy to use faith as a way to get fans or create a fake persona.   He clearly uses it as a marketing tactic and that‚Äôs so disgusting.
[deleted]
This isn't his first one correct? He needs to spend significant time in jail now.
What blows me away is that he's in fucking New Mexico...you can just drive out to the mountains or far out in the desert and shoot your gun off if you really can't find an open range. People do it here in AZ all the time. What a fucking idiot.
He is so scared of Reyes, he is tryna get locked up to avoid him /s
Jesus Christ lmfao. It‚Äôs like clockwork
Is no one gonna talk about how our boy is 6‚Äô6‚Äù on the dot in this picture as opposed to the UFCs official listing at 6‚Äô4‚Äù? Thats insane.

Coronavirus : y'all gotta stay inside

Jones: hold my dick pills
Oh wow, Jon Jones is a piece of shit. Who'd have ever fucking thought that?

But of course he makes Daddy Dana money so give it a couple of months and he'll be on his "comeback" tour completely with half-hour special about how he's changed his life and fellated Jesus or some shit.

Fuck this guy and anyone that apologizes for him.
I'm not surprised motherfuckers.

I wonder if he told the cops he was pulsing so it was all okay.
Ahhhh Jon, never a dull day with you.
Oh, how I fondly remember this beautiful post just days before this incident...

"In times like these I‚Äôm just glad to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, that alone has given me so much peace. I want to strongly encourage someone out there to give him a try"

Thank you, Jon for giving me so much joy in these troubling times. 

Sincerely,

MMA community
Everyone deserves a 7th chance
He was found alone, in a parked car, with a pistol, and a bottle of whiskey. Sounds sad.
Even he looks amused in his own mug shot like "lol, what am i like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
 I JUST GOTTA THANK GOD FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY...  

Fuck Jon, he's a piece of shit, Santos and Reyes both beat him.  Kick his ass out of the UFC, and let's get on with it.
he can't let ashlee evans-smith usurp him as the worst person in the ufc
Joe Rogan: I heard that that hand gun under the seat found in Jones's car had been there ever since he bought that car. That seat was made in a factory in Mexico where they also make handguns where the barrels are always hot like they were just fired. It happens man. Like when we first started selling  kettlebells at Onnit, we started getting these messages from customers saying they were finding 25 lbs Olympic plates under the kettlebells they received from the manufacturer we contracted. We found out that the same manufacturer made Olympic plates and had not thoroughly cleaned out their manufacturing floor before they started making batches of our kettlebells.

True story man. It is entirely possible that that hand gun didn't even belong to Jon and had just been sitting there this whole time without him knowing. I'm not entirely sure if he was drunk either. I had heard that the cocaine Jon had been snorting was cut with chlomiphene that was made in an Argentinean plant that also makes alcohol.
It's that time of year again where Jon gets arrested
At the bottom of the article: "Jon Jones hires Driver" lmao. This dude shouldn't be allowed to own cars. Or guns for that matter.
Albuquerque PD: Hey pussy, you there?

Jon: Yeah I‚Äôm here
If 2020 was a person... it would be Jon.
Breaking news: POS is still a POS
Isn't he a guy who tested positive on roids but was still allowed to fight?
The God fearing, Bible verse quoting, Jesus Christ thanking, family man of a UFC fighter right there ladies and gentlemen
This is sacrifice we need for for Khabib vs Ferg.
Throw the book at him, jail time and everything. 
Reyes 1,2,3.
Ah finally some normalcy and consistency in these trying times.
A comment from the espnmma Instagram post about the situation: 

>everyone is not perfect and we make mistakes and sometimes we just repeat them but it doesn‚Äôt make us bad person just because jones has done mistakes in the past and now. don‚Äôt forget the good things he has done  

Like, I'm all for second chances, forgiveness and such but...  
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?!
Holy fuck this guy is the biggest fucking piece of shit. Waste of talent. Hope he disappears.
But his fans think he is somehow above steroid use.
Further more, can't this man afford to hire a butler to drive him around for the rest of his life? just stop this dumb shit man
Are we in Goofcon 1?
God with a 10-7 round.
This sub just had the biggest orgasm
Actually, Your Honor, his firearm was only pulsing after a negligent use that he was already charged for 3 years ago. We do have double jeopardy laws in this country, Your Honor.
Reyes 48-47

The best [tweet](https://twitter.com/the_mma_nerd/status/1243220190319357952?s=21) about this topic
 Please remove this until more conclusive evidence arises. It's unfair to compromise the integrity of an honest, hardworking, role model of a fighter over something like this. This is entirely out of character for him and I just can't see it being true.
Pretty sure I said this 3 career ending incidents ago, but this guy is the single greatest waste of athletic skill that has ever been.
Not long ago I was lit up in a thread for saying this guy is a narcissistic piece of shit who habitually breaks the law and how I can't understand why people fawn over him so much.

And here we are.

Welcome to our sport, r/all! This is huge because of three things:

* these two trash talked each other to death
* this is now the FASTEST knockout in UFC history (maybe even MMA history)
* from /u/reddit111987: this is also huge because Ben was undefeated, and a two organization champion. He only needed to beat Top 5 fighter Masvidal and maybe one more fighter to get his UFC title shot.

[Join us in the fight thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/c8gd1l/official_ufc_239_jones_vs_santos_live_discussion/) because we have two huge fights coming up:

This sport is the most insane thing I have seen in my entire life.
Man in the prefight, Askren said "Everyone should be worried because now they know I can take the big shot" LOL
The reaction from Askren as Jorge ran towards him has me at a loss for words. Especially considering the level of wrestling that Ben has. 

He literally just dipped his head down and extended his arms to put his head in the perfect place for Jorge.

Edit: Ben was legit STIFF. His legs were frozen when the ref tried to roll him over. Holy fuck. 4 seconds (fight clock wasnt even on the screen yet when Jorge slept him)
OH MY FUCKING GOD

Literally perfect

I can‚Äôt even fucking imagine

r/all this is the greatest KO I‚Äôve ever seen. This is gonna be on the Highlight reels FOREVER.
It's difficult to think of a situation that would do more to change your life than Ben Askren being knocked out by Jorge Masvidal in <5 seconds.

In five seconds, he went from undefeated wrestler with an unknown quantity in UFC, to a potential retiree. His whole story changes with those five seconds.
Holy. Fucking. Shit.
[deleted]
Masvidal Payout - 50,000 
Bonus - 50,000
Extra Dana White drunk thank you so much for knocking that bitch out 
1,000,000 plus a car.
Hey all I just stepped away for a moment does someone know when the fight starts?
[deleted]
Knee was telegraphed as fuck but Askren still shot so one dimensional he commited suicide.
Florida man ko's UFC fighter in 5 seconds
this is going to be on every 'talk shit get hit' youtube video ever
The best thing to happen to Luke Rockhold was this KO
HOLY SHIT. I HAVEN'T WITNESSED SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE

Add Jesus Masvidal to the mythical fighters list.
You got knocked out in three seconds boom roasted
BEN: *wakes up* When is the fight starting?
I woke the baby up. Wife not happy lol
It was a literal honor to watch this live.
One piece, extra soda
EVERYBODY GET IN HERE LMAOOOOO
It's funny, I feel at once both amazed at that fight and somewhat cheated of the stylistic matchup we didnt really get to see. Maybe greatest of all time KO though holy shit.
Holy shit!

Greatest KO ever?
what the fuck
I can‚Äôt believe this is real. Mma bless
Fastest in UFC history
What in fucking tarnation. quickest knockout ever. 5 seconds. my god.

I can watch this on repeat forever.
FALCON KNEE
Colby is so conflicted right now. He just got leapfrogged for real this time.
Well, he‚Äôs Ben Askren for it.




Edit: Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!
"why did you chose that strike"

"Cause he's a bum"


Ahahahah, Jorge's the shit.
Ben, after a performance like that, I will fight you. - Conor McGregor
That was a bullshit stoppage. Ben's thumb was up.
Yoooooooooooooooooooooo
Copyrighting a 5 second clip and removing it from the top spot of the most popular content sharing website in the world is a perfect representation of how incompetent big media is.

I had to google search a shitty youtube rip of the fight to show my friends at work. This benefits noone.
https://media.giphy.com/media/jnV82lKYvKc2wuFIhV/giphy.gif
I LUHHHH YOU
FASTEST AND GREATEST KO you've ever seen, my fucking bozos!

JORGE FUCKEN MASVIDAL!
This is why Jon Jones starts his fights crouched, can‚Äôt get hit by a flying knee.
Fuck off Reddit with this copywrite shit.
Good job UFC/ESPN purging one of the greatest fight highlights of the sports history.

Really great way to grow interest in your product.

I'm mostly ashamed that Reddit has allowed this type of censorship recently. Seems things really started changing here about 6-8 months ago.
Paul George trade visualized
Wtf askren. Don't just go for the take down if someone is flying at you.
LOOOOLLLL IT HAPPENED
Good lord if Askren didn't talk a fuckload of annoying shit in the build up I'd almost be half concerned for his safety. 

That's one of the nastiest KO's we'll ever see boys.
Jorge is a bad mother fucker. I‚Äôm so curious to see what Ben has to say about this when he‚Äôs brought back to life
[3 piece and Soda](https://imgur.com/a/xNrw4dw)
HOLY FUCK
Fucking knocked Ben's hair straight.
I just witnessed one of the greatest things of all time.

Edit: Someone said about Masvidal mocking Ben "ruined" it for him and all I can say is that is hilarious. They're two men talking shit looking to hurt each other so if you can watch someone get put to sleep like that then someone Masvidal hates being mocked by him after getting KO'd doesn't compare...

It should only become a problem when people online are pathetic enough to spend every minute of their life mocking fighters who spend their lives trying to be the best.
Holy shit!  

I WANT TO BE IN THE SCREENSHOT OF THE FASTEST KNOCKOUT IN THE HISTORY OF EVER.
I thought Askren was legit dead, fuck me
5 fucking seconds . Welcome to ufc funky.
‚ÄòWhy the flying knee?‚Äô ‚ÄòBecause he‚Äôs a bum.‚Äô Absolute best shit I‚Äôve ever heard
Omg omg omg omg omg omg
This interview is about to be career ending for ben
This might get very sad, very fast. i hope they get Askren to hospital ASAP, that shit might have done some serious damage. 

Hopefully just a concussion.
That 17 second clip has been watched almost 200K times. lmao. Everyone is doing like me and hitting replay to see it just one more time, it's like crack.
*I used to fight UFC, but then I took a knee to my face.*
Wow UFC gets on the top of Reddit‚Äôs front page and they request a copyright take down. The PPV is over, this is free marketing dummies.

#BOOM, ROASTED
OH SHITTTTTTTTTTT!

GAME FUCKING BRED!
As a fan, what a spectacular technique executed. Holy shit! As a fighter and father and human, that had me concerned for Askren and his family. I hope he recovers well.

And i hope Masvidal gets that title shot
Has anyone started a Go Fund Me for Jorge Masvidal? I feel like we all owe him.

So satisfying, i may wank to this knockout later when my gf's asleep.
Gamebred gamed Funkmaster.
**LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY**
Haaa, come back from that!

Masvidal is just fucking wild. That was a freaking madman thing to do and it chewed right through that cocky asshole in 3 seconds. Askren might need a long layoff after that.
Is it just me or are fights like these why you love and hate watching MMA? Why does someone always have to lose...but then again someone wins! My heart is confused.
Hope Askren makes a speedy recovery. But it's kind of hilarious because Mazvidal was saying all fight week that Ben is a master at putting his head in crotches. And then seeing the end with Askren's attempt to put head in crotch.
ESPN is straight up stupid to remove this, it‚Äôs a 5 second clip that‚Äôs all over social media anyways and it‚Äôs amazing promotion for the sport. It‚Äôs actually idiotic to remove it.
You got to feel bad for Askren here, what a shitty way to go out, he didn't even get to punch him in the mouth once, he didn't lay a finger on him and Masvidal even got in his face after, humiliated him. Damn. 

I feel a little bit robbed, I really wanted to see these two fight. We only got 5 seconds, but holy fuck, what a finish.
[removed]
WTF
FASTEST KNOCKOUT OF ALL TIME WOW
This clip is 17 seconds, shows the start of the fight, and is about 10 seconds too long. What the fuck.
From watching his fights on YouTube as a kid to seeing him have the fastest KO in UFC history... GAMEBRED
That‚Äôs horrifying. That is some brain damage type shit that he will deal with for the rest of his life.
Zigged when he should have zagged
This sort of wild unpredictability is exactly why MMA is my favourite sport in the world and it‚Äôs not even close
Ben Askren now sponsored by V8
Ben askren was probably telling the people walking him out that he needs to go fight Jorge masvidal.
Jorge: "It wasn't personal."    


Jorge 3 minutes later: "I really wanted to hurt him. For as long as I could, as much as I could. Destroy his knee caps. Bust his ribs. Make him piss blood. And THEN send him home packing."
Jorge probably wishing Steve Mazzagatti was refereeing
OUT
3 PIECE WITH DA FUCKING SODA
Masvidal legit just memed on a memelord and made Askren a corpse.

Lived up to the shittalk 100%.
Something has clicked within Masvidal, he‚Äôs figured it all out and is clowning everybody as he works his way to the top. 

He might just have the best timing in all of the UFC right now, this KO was *filthy*.
MURDER
I‚Äôve been watching the sport for 10 years and that might be the most satisfying result ever. Up there with Holm/Rousey.
>Ben Askren transported to hospital, per UFC. - @bokamotoESPN
Masvidal ruined fighting. Nothing will ever top that.
Is anyone bummed the fight finished so quickly? This doesn't tell me if Askren can hang with the elite fighters or if Masvidal can grapple with an elite wrestler.

It really didn't answer anything besides Askren is predictable.

This is why I'm usually not a fan of immediate knockouts.
YO DID SOMEONE ORDER THE EXTRA LARGE?
Ben Askren: Wakes up in the shadow realm

Luke Rockhold: First time?
There is a fine line between being wrestle fucked for 3-5 rounds and being ktfo right away, apparently lol.
[Ben gets tucked in](https://imgur.com/a/DU3DEGQ)
Leaned right into it but holy fuck jorge
Nani?
Damn Askren and Luke were playing cards in the shadowrealm
TOP OF /r/all WITH THE BOIIIIIIIS [Wooooo!](https://i.imgur.com/cLDPJ29.jpg)
Hope he's ok, but glad he got humbled.
Me: ‚Äúwas it smart to drop $600 on tickets to see ufc 239?‚Äù

Me after masvidal, blachociv and nunes:  ‚Äúyep‚Äù
Scariest knockout I've ever seen. I honestly thought nothing would top Francis/Overeem for me. Holy shit.
Now I understand the term "starched"
UFC literally posted the finish why does this get removed. This shit is getting stupid.

Boooooo they deleted it
Why is there never any Mirrors for these?

I have a strong feeling that the buildup and trashtalk leading to the fight will be better than the fight itself
[deleted]
The fight might be a stinker, but the build up will be epic. 

Should be a fun ride. 
The trash talk will block out the sun
Well Conor has "a puncher's chance"... But he's also fighting a guy who specializes in not getting punched. 
If McGregor wins this I'll name my child Conor and never doubt him again 
If Conor wins he needs to challenge Usain Bolt in a race

If Conor wins, we are in a simulation, bro.
/r/boxing vs /r/mma
"I'm the one in 49 and fookin' 1" 
Interesting note, Floyd is undefeated against non-boxers.

He defeated Big Show at Wrestlemania 24.
some of yall act like if Lebron said he wanted to play in the NFL you wouldn't be interested in watching 
I will eat da poo poo if Conor wins

Edit: fuck well this took off nicely

Edit2: any recommendations on foods to eat to make the poop taste better?
Lets just remember this famous post from Conor's old Facebook from only 5 years ago: http://i.imgur.com/CF7fzVV.jpg

And now look at what hes set to earn from this fight. Inspirational. 
Michael Buffer to announce Floyd, Bruce Buffer to announce Conor! 
Anticipating people from /r/all: 


[Floyd Mayweather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.) is a boxer who has a perfect record of 49-0. He retired after a fight with Andre Berto in 2015 and is currently 40 years old. He is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. His fight with Pacquiao reportedly earned him in excess of $220m.

[Conor McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor) fights in MMA and prioritises a striking style; a southpaw (left-handed) fighter, he has had a very fast rise to stardom by talking a lot of trash and, usually, backing it up. At 28 years old, he has enjoyed phenomenal success in MMA. 


I think it's fair to say that very few people in the MMA community expected this fight to happen, and saw it as more outrageous talk from Conor. Given that boxing is quite different from MMA, Conor would likely be a huge underdog despite the 12 year age difference. Fans are excited to see what happens next; and many will be skeptical of the confirmation until more sources come forward. 
[deleted]
I just want Mcgregor to win for the endless chaos and memes.
Very good outcome for Dana White. This will be such an incredibly boring and terrible fight that it will turn even more casual fans away from boxing and potentially into the arms of MMA 
Let's be honest, Conor is a southpaw and Floyd has already beaten the best southpaw of this generation. 

I get the feeling this will be an exhibition type of thing.

Like, McGregor is not really able to compete with Floyd and Floyd is content to smack him around, circle and dodge, but never trying to finish. We will get a one-sided non-event like when Floyd fought Robert Guerrero. 

Afterwards, Conor will say he felt he was competitive with Floyd and Dana will tell us how amazing Conor is because he could go a full match with Floyd and not get KO'd. 
[removed]
Man if Conor somehow pulls this off... think of what that would do.
[deleted]
If Conor wins by knockout, I'll eat my socks live on Twitch.  No bamboozles.  
The thing that is remarkable about Connor Mcgregor is they way he had manipulated his entire career through the power of personality.  I respect his talents, but somehow he has leveraged his trash talking ability into a ridiculous payday against one of the best boxers of all time.  It is astonishing.  I hope he wins so the the world blows up, and he takes on Kim Jong Un next.
Shit, I'd fight a lion for $100 mil in 30 minutes...ok not really, but I'd definitely fight a Mayweather.
I'm no boxing or MMA expert, so someone tell me if I'm wrong here: Floyd is going to dance and avoid Conor's big left while peppering him with jabs and body blows for 12 rounds, right? No real drama, easy win for Floyd 
Conor already won.  I doubt the outcome matters all that much to him, he's about to get paid big time.
They will box, so it's obvious Mayweather will win.
It's pointless. It's like putting Usain Bolt up against a top, top hurdler in the 100 meters.
Can't wait for Mayweather to punch McGregor once per round and then win on points, it's gonna be fucking WILD
Two options:

1. Real Fight - Conor gets his ass handed to him on a plate, $100mil each, both retire rich and happy.

2. Money Fight - Goes to judges, split decision, rematch, another $100mil each, both retire rich and happy.
Obviously an insane mismatch, but I will say this: Nobody in sports gets under their opponent's skin like McGregor, and nobody thrives under insane pressure like him. 

Mix that in with the 40 to 28 age difference, and I think Conor ratchets up what should be about a 0.5% chance of victory to 3% or 4%.

I know that kind of sounds like a backhanded insult, but I think it's actually pretty significant.
If McGregor Wins I will change my legal name to Notorious. 
Floyd will turn into a panicked wrestler
[deleted]
All I want is for both Mike and Bruce Buffer to come out... 

And NOW it's TIME.. to RUUMBLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Boxings revenge for the Randy Couture vs James Toney fight.
[removed]
"We're not here to take part, we're here to take over."

Well played Conor, ya legend you.
I'm not buying it until it comes from the Gooffather's mouth. Last I heard was that Floyd still hasn't got his license for August, hasn't done his med tests/physical either. 

EDIT: AND HERE WE GO
Conor is a genius! He shit-talked his way into $80+ million payday. His largest purse from a fight was $15 million prior. This is win win for Conor and a potentially embarrassing loss for Mayweather. 
This fight is going to be a joke. 
I think they should fight twice: once with UFC rules and once with boxing rules. Not sure how they'll break the tie... I'm sure the r/theocho could figure something out. 
Mayweather via flying armbar
I had CM Punk at least showing well against Mickey Gall so I'm gonna shut the fuck up about this matchup.
If McGregor gets a KO within the first 3 rounds im getting his named tattooed across my forehead in plain times new roman font. Size 32. Bold.
You all said it wouldn't happen.

You all said McGregor was just another loudmouth and would never beat Aldo.

You all said I was fat and could never run 3 miles.

Well look at Conor only now.
[https://gastroagogo.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ggg-37-2.gif](https://gastroagogo.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ggg-37-2.gif)
If Conor manages to somehow pull off a victory, we'll  have lived in an era where Leicester won the title and Conor beat 49-0 Mayweather. I'd be convinced that this is all a simulation.
[deleted]
big problem here is the way Mayweather boxes, i mean its hard enough facing an elite boxer but the way Floyd moves even veteran boxers like Manny could not touch him. i really cant see McGregor hitting him much.
Mayweather will turn in a very boring win.
I hope this ends with someone getting hit with a steel chair and Vince McMahon sharing a beer over the body of the victim with the Victor. That's the only fitting end this deserves for this circus attraction of a match.

...I'll still go to the bar to watch all 12 rounds of nothing and be back to complain about it afterwards.
Canelo/GGG was supposed to be the biggest fight of the year, Now this happens. Say what you want about this fight as a contest but it's a testament to McGregor's rise. 5 years ago the guy was on the unemployment line, now he's fighting the greatest boxer of this generation for 100m+. It's mind boggling
[deleted]
mma fighter boxing a life long boxer.. hmmm
Discussing Connor's boxing skill is pointless, everybody knows this is a money fight.

After this fight Connor can retire from mma without even defending his UFC belt.
I can't stand Floyd, big McGregor fan, but lets be real he's going up against the greatest defensive boxer of all time, there is no debate. The way I see this fight going is Mayweather completely outclassing him to a boring ass decision win. I would be surprised if McGregor lands anything significant to be honest.

Gonna put 10 000$ on Conor.
On the 27th I'll send you pictures from the Bahamas
I just want Mcgregor to win for the endless chaos and memes.
I'm putting waste money down on Conor in the one in a billion chance he KO's him.
If McGregor gets frustrated and kicks Floyd unconscious I'd die laughing.
Just got back from the future, guys. Here's how the fight went:

R1: 10-9 Mayweather


R2: 10-9 Mayweather


R3: 10-9 Mayweather


R4: 10-9 Mayweather


R5: 10-9 Mayweather


R6: 10-9 Mayweather


R7: 10-9 Mayweather


R8: 10-9 Mayweather


R9: 10-9 Mayweather


R10: 10-9 Mayweather


R11: 10-9 Mayweather


R12: 10-9 Mayweather

Highlight: Mayweather jabbed then ducked the whole fight.
Lt. Frank Drebin: All I know is never bet on the white guy.
I love McGregor and I think Mayweather is a fucking dipshit but is there any way Mayweather doesn't win by, like, a lot?
I really hope this is the dimension where Bisping wins his next fight and Conor KO's Floyd. The salt will be fucking glorious if both happen.
Conor is really going to retire from MMA without ever defending a belt in an organization. 
[deleted]
Paddy Power has a 12/1 odds of McGregor throwing a kick. Couldn't help but laugh.
Our poor, poor mods.  
God speed. 
McGregor will win this fight. If he loses I will post a video shaving my head. *Mark my words*.
Red panty night for /u/AlrightyThen234.

Enjoy the karma!
Floyd is gonna take Conor to school. I need to see the Vegas odds on this one.
If Mcgregor wins this, I will stop being an atheist and become a McGregorist. I will pray to Conor every night. Conor Bless.
It has this old MMA entertainment value. Fighters from two different traditions meeting. The problem  is that everybody (at least MMA and boxing fans)  know the end result. Boxer will win boxing match. 

It should have been a sumo match or something alien for both. 

It's all about Money. Fighting Money for money. Being punched by Money for good money.  Getting KO'd by Money and waking up with lots of money. 


Until Conor and Floyd come out and say it, it's all wolf tickets

Edit: and there we go folks. IT'S ON. I am full mast on a bus currently if anyone cares
If McGregor wins I'll get him tattood on me
WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE!!!
Ohh boy. Now every fighter with a twitter will be trying to call out boxers for a better paycheck.

Wow. Conor doesn't have a prayer unless Floyd magically got slow since his last fight. 
Conor will get pissed and do something to get DQed on purpose. No one actually loses the fight. Trash talk and promoting continues forever. Money will be made. 

Sorry for the spoiler. 
I only want to see this fight with hopes that McGregor's normal fighting instincts take over and he just roundhouses Mayweather. That boy deserves a good kick to the face.
[deleted]
This fight is gonna be legen-- wait for it...
Not saying I'm gonna buy it, but I'm definitely going to watch just on the off chance that McGregor land that one punch. I don't want to regret not seeing it live if it happens. 
[Listen to Andre Berto describe in detail what's it's like to fight Floyd Mayweather.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQjvXRcnPvw)
Expect Nate Diaz to show up to one of the press conferences with a cooler
When is the press conference going to be and how much will it cost?
People are shitting on them but who can really blame them? Who else is in the position to make 100 mil in a half an hour? 

Fuck it, why not. They literally don't owe anyone anything. They both got into fighting for the money, why not take the ultimate payday? If you're a "purist" and turned off, don't watch. Pretty simple.  All the fans are entitled to is a show, and this is a show... even if it's a weird one. 
Let's see if Mayweather remembers to hug his wife and punch his opponent this time. 
Mcgregor has a punchers chance, but I'm 99.9% sure that he's fucked.  Still though, I'll let Mayweather fuck my shit up for 100 mil.  
Can't wait to stream it
Yahoo is still alive?
Mayweather is going to destroy this dude. 
McGregor via Bisping-Rockhold Syndrome, Round 4
Here is the thing, on pure boxing skills, mac does not stand a chance to beat any top 10 fighter in his weight class.  So much of folks perception thinking mac has any small chance, based on his mma skills,. For one moment take away macs mma memories and just pic his boxing skills, good night sweet prince 
After so much back and forth I really didn't think it would happen. Now I'm just hoping the impossible happens and Conor wins the fight.
Mayweather throws this fight to setup a trilogy worth 1.5b total.
if this fight is anything but boring I will eat a plastic cup from taco bell

edit: note to self, never take your random thought and turn it into a reddit comment, it may come back to bite you in the ass 
I hope you're all ready for a promotional event that will redefine the very concept of wolf tickets.

Never again will we see so many *terrible* takes for a single fight.
[deleted]
Floyd will win. He's the better boxer and he'll play the numbers, just like he did with pac
So can we get the Buffer brothers to do a co-intro to the fight?
The press conference will be more entertaining than the fight itself. smh
Pretty boy is going to show up to this fight.... he wants his finale to be remembered. It'll be an easy victory against an inexperienced competitor.
"get in, get rich, get out"
Conor doesn't give a fook if he wins or not. He's bloody rich and is just piling it on with this Mayweather fight. 
TANKS FOR DA CHEEEEEESE!
It'll be a repeat of the Manny fight.

It's pay day for both of them. They both know neither of them will take any real punishment and they each walk away with millions.
I wonder who Artem is going to fight on the undercard...... 
Alot of Boxing purists in here saying they aren't buying this PPV. That'll change. Once the press conferences start and Conor starts shit talking boxing and Floyd you'll wanna see the "cocky Irish prick" get his ego checked. And Floyd will feel the same way. And he won't try to out point him he'll try to KO him to prove a point. And much like Jose Aldo, Floyd will be too aggressive. And it's not so easy to dodge a McGregor counter. And with lightning like precision and power, McGregor will sleep the greatest boxer of all time in his first and only boxing bout. 

Or Floyd will just do what he's always done and this will be 36 minutes of Conor hitting air and Floyd tapping him on the shoulder. 

I'm in either way. 
Save yourself the money and time, Mayweather wins on points
49-1
Vegas is fucking outrageous... They are giving Mcgregor ~~better chance~~ the same chance at beating Mayweather than they gave Holm to beat rousey... That is so fucking absurd...and also scary because vegas is sneaky smart sometimes
Wait... **WHAT?!** 

#**THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?!** 

Holy shit! 

How in the...?! 
The biggest question here is what Buffer will announce the fight?
Can't wait until these two make it over to WWE together.
Is there any reason to think McGregor will beat Floyd? Everythingggggg I read says there is no way...
Can't see how Conor ever fights again after this.
Conor will gas way before the 12th round, but Floyd won't knock him out. The last 5 rounds will be hard to watch as Floyd demoralizes Conor en route to a decisive decision. 
I've doubted him every fight since the Chad Mendes fight, and I will continue to do so.
i bet they're going to slow dance for 12 rounds and play everyone for suckers.  But maybe im just being cynical.
Gotta hand it to Conor. He really knows how to use trash talk to promote a fight. He used to be on welfare, now he's gonna make "fuck you" retirement money for dancing around the ring with Floyd. 
There are literally amateur boxers who are better than McG
This feels like one of the best ping pong players in the world playing the best tennis player in the world at tennis. 
The way I see it, the only hope for an entertaining fight would be that after Floyd picks Conor apart for a few rounds,  Connor decides it's bad for his brand and takes Floyd to the mat for an MMA style beat down. 
I'll believe it when the fight is over.
This is going to be the boxing equivalent of Randy vs James
Conor may never fight again after this. 
What will the fallout be if Conor ends up winning?
wtf.  there is literally 1 sentence in the article separating these two lines:

>Mayweather is considered the greatest boxer of his generation and among the best of all-time.

and

>McGregor [...] has never boxed before, either amateur or pro. 

Vegas has McGregor at +700, Mayweather -1100. 
Next fight is going to Floyd vs Floyd from 12 years ago. It will happen in 2 years when we finally get the time machine working here in the Pentagon. 
Ok, so will Conor make $100 million? If he does, you can't help but to respect the man. Dude us getting paid and he's paired with the right people. 
[deleted]
What would it mean to boxing if McGregor actually won? 
I'm gonna need Joe Rogan and someone from the boxing world announcing this fight. 
I don't see Floyd Knocking him out so if Conor cant touch him either and age hasn't caught up to Floyd. Then this will be one long ass fight lmao.
Connor has little chance but the first 8 rounds of Mayweather v Hatton are a fair blueprint.  Hatton put Mayweather in a phone box and the fight was even-ish after 8.  Eventually Mayweather got some space and KOd Hatton.  If Connor sits on Mayweather and brawls he has a 1 out of 10 chance but that will be exhausting work.

Well played Conor McGregor, from being on the dole a few years back to earning over 80 million for one fight! 

Whatever happens he's won.
Conor "The Notorious" McGregor vs. Floyd "The Illiterate" Mayweather. I'm not putting my money on Conor but I sure as hell want him to knock the soul out of Floyd.
145 pound Conor in boxing.. 

He looked  average against a mid-tier south african boxer.. 

Fuck it I'm gonna watch it anyways just to see a Manny vs Floyd 2.0

Defensive genious vs a notrious baiter and counter puncher= snoozefest
[deleted]
Smartest decision Conor could make. He makes unbelievable money for a fight that no one expects him to win. And if somehow he pulls it off, it'll be one of - if not the biggest upset in all of sports history. 
Conor is already on my head and I'm not even fighting. That Floyd sr instagram sheit is fun af
$100M for a single fight? They can both just half-ass it so neither gets hurt.
I'm here for the trashtalking and the disappointment.
Conor has the advantages in height, reach, weight, power, and age. Can he pull off the upset? All I know is that it'll be pandemonium 2017 if he does.
Floyd is @ -900 right now(9:1 favorite).

People are going to start pouring in money on Conor pretty soon, and I suspect Floyd will only be around a 5:1 favorite come fight night.

I like Conor more than Floyd, personality wise, but there's no way he wins this fight. I'm going to make a lot of money off of this.
The weigh-in will be better than the fight itself. 
tbh kinda surprised odds are only -1000 for mayweather. 
Is it going to be boxing or MMA rules?
Mayweather has a lot of hand and wrist issues now and likely no longer has the power to knock McGregor out, but he's still agile and can move really well. His best strategy is going to be to bop and move for 12 rounds and win by decision. I think there's a very high probability in this.

McGregor likely does have the power to knock Mayweather out but that's only if he can catch him. McGregor is fast but I think Mayweather might be faster. That said, McGregor has shown the ability to increase his speed over his career so he may have been able to pick up a step or two now that he doesn't have to worry about throwing or defending a kick or takedown. 

McGregor is thought to have a strong chin but Diaz caught him with a couple shots that weren't necessarily strong or accurate and staggered Conor. Mayweather may not have the strength to knock out McGregor but he can definitely stun him and slow him down.

If Conor can stay fast and keep up with Mayweather's jab, dodge, counter game then we might be in for an entertaining fight and actual decision.

Wild card is when Conor is down in points around the 10th or 11th and trips or tosses Mayweather from the clinch. Fight is declared no contest and both fighters spend the next 18 months hyping up a rematch.
Who has less to lose? To me Conor. Is that the consensus?   
edit: spelling 
This is like me eating 5 coney dogs and thinking I can beat Joey chestnut. He outboxes UFC fighters that are barely club/amateur level. I'll be surprised if he even touches Mayweather once. This reminds me of when Tyson got out of prison and he fought some stew bum, but we were all so geeked up we bought it. All Mayweather needs to do is use his extraordinary head moooment and this is a wrap.


EDIT: Added more comments, work midnights, had the night off and bought some of the newly released Founder's summer beers and the ridiculousness of this fight keeps popping in my head. With that said, take my money, I'm in. 
It's the biggest bamboozle I've ever been apart of
>On Sky Sports News they are showing highlights of Mayweather vs. The Big Show when talking about the McGregor fight.

https://twitter.com/SeanSheehanBA/status/875352695980400640
What's everyone's guess on the ppv price point? I'm thinking $149, no rewinds, no 24 hour replays.
Rooting for Mcgregor to shock the world...

but at the same time I am also hoping Mayweather Rocks him in the later round and Conor turning into a panic wrassler.  
The real losers will be the people who pay fifty bucks for what will def be a garbage undercard leading up to 9 rounds of cat and mouse.  
If McGregor wins, we all know it was because Floyd is old.  If Floyd wins, it was expected and everyone praises McGregor for having the balls to get in there with Floyd (and make the kind of money no one would refuse).  There's nothing to lose for either man.  Nothing at stake.  Both guys will laugh all the way to the bank in a win/win situation.  
Connor Mcgregor. 28 years old. Prime of his life. Strongest, fastest, most stamina he may ever have. 

Floydd Mayweather. 40 years old. Slower, weaker than he's ever been. Hands broken from a life of combat. Arguably the greatest defensive boxer of all time. 


There are a million and one ways this could play out. That is why the world is stoked for this event. 

Smart money is Mayweather in 12 decision. Bet the farm


This whole thing is pointless. Of course Floyd is going to win a boxing fight, and Conor would win a MMA fight. It's like putting a quarterback against a pitcher just because they both throw a ball. 
We're all ignoring the real fight we diserve.. rousey vs mayweather.. 
Just like most everyone else I think mayweather wins. It's boxing which is his specialty. In an mma fight Connor wins, in a boxing match you assume mayweather wins. Any educated fan would agree 

Imo Connor has 1-3(5) rounds to knock him out but if it lasts longer I think mayweather wins. 
 
Like I said I Think mayweather wins. But Connor is known to make the upset. Either way it sets up Mayweather Mcgregor 2

I think mayweather wins. But either way t's a win win for Connor.  He makes money either way. If he loses he makes a bunch of money and goes back to the UFC. If he wins it's a huge upset  he makes  the UFC the biggest thing ever. Either way he draws more people  into the UFC  is why I think Dana is a willing to do 

 
This is both genius and retarded at the same time.  
I wonder if Conor truly thinks he can win, or if he's just content to do the pre-fight hype and collect his fat check.
Win or defeat, it's 100mm + payday. Retire like boss even with the L. 
A lot of promises in this thread. I hope someone is keeping track.
I don't advocate pirating sports but when i do.... 
Its because i hate all involved.

This guy just doesn't learn . Such a good fighter but can't seem to shake the "I know this is wrong but I'm going to do it anyway" mentality 
Something makes me think Jones vs. Ovince was the only clean Jones.
If this is actually TMZ, they're usally really reliable. 

Edit: All the other sources are flooding in now. Unreal. Jon Jones is the p4p GOAT at beating Jon Jones. 
Jon Jones has to be the most stupid person I have ever seen. 
I feel so bad for Cormier, he took a lot of damage in that fight. 
This whole thing just makes me feel terrible for DC. 

Played his whole life by the book, stand up man, father and fighter. Came second in his wrestling days, but never stopped fighting and beat everyone in his path except this one man. 

Now he lost the rematch there will always be doubters, and he'll never be able to prove that he could beat a clean Jon Jones because of the suspension. 
In two separate tests conducted a year apart, Jones has tested positive for:

Hydroxy-clomiphene, an anti-estrogenic agent,

Letrozole, commonly used to treat gyno caused by steroid use,

and Turanibol, an outright anabolic steroid.

That combination just doesn't happen to end up in someone's body. 

He only had two fights under USADA - OSP (against whom he looked like shit) and two fights scheduled against Cormier (200 and 214), testing positive both times.

He's done.
he got busted for Turinabol

Without question the effects of Oral Turinabol will be most valuable to the athlete and by athlete we actually mean athlete. We‚Äôre not talking about the bodybuilder or gym rat that lives like one but rather someone who competes in a competitive sport of physical skill. The use of Oral Turinabol will significantly promote muscular endurance, they won‚Äôt tire out as fast and their overall rate of recovery should be greatly improved. As the season wanes on, they should also find they have taken less of a beating and are closer to the physical peak they enjoyed at the beginning of the season. This would not occur without the anabolic protectant nature. The athlete should also find his strength is noticeably improved upon. Yes, he should be stronger, which can directly translate into physical power and speed. No, it will not create the athlete, it will not create athletic ability, affect coordination or turn a sloth into a star, but it will enhance the existing athlete within. If it wasn‚Äôt phenomenal for this purpose you can bet the East Germans wouldn‚Äôt have been using it and successfully so for nearly two decades.
Let Brock have his steroids and make the fight!
Wait what 
This fucking scumbag has been a cheat his whole career and now that USADA came in he still cant stop because he doesnt want to look like a shadow of himself. Ban this piece of shit from the sport forever. DC is the greatest LHW of all time. 
Looks like Jones Vs Lesnar will now have to be IN A STEEL CAGE 
Jon Jones is officially the biggest waste of talent of all time in MMA. He just fucks up at every possible opportunity.
A tiger cannot change it's stripes. It's too much, bah God 
When I die I want Jon jones to lower my casket so he can let me down one more time 
What a prick. Hopefully this can give DC closure on being the best LHW of all time. Jones is completely discredited imo. A juice head since day one. If he's doing it now with USADA around he sure as fuck was doing it before. Fuck him.

Who the fuck talks like that? Lmao, he clearly almost said he beat him on steroids too.
[deleted]
I keep reading comments saying "he could be the best without steroids why would he do this?!". Who knows what level he'd be at as a clean athlete, obviously he feels he needs them to compete and for all we know he's been using for his entire career. If he was clean he'd likely be much weaker, have less power in his strikes, less aggression/confidence, able to train much less and get injured more frequently. Natural Jon Jones might not even be top 10, but I guess we'll never know, thanks to his choices to roid up repeatedly like his brother
1) Take steroids, get caught, blame ED pill.  2) Take steroids, get caught, blame tainted supplements.  3) Take steroids, get caught, blame, flintstones vitamins.

Cormier is the champ in my eyes, Jones has lost my fandom forever. You can say what you want to defend him but Jones is done, I don't want to see him in the octagon ever again. He doesn't deserve it whatsoever. So disappointed in him... Give Cormier that belt back with another fight against Gus. 
they should just have a steroid division and find the greatest fighter science can create
Let Lesnar and Jones fight in international waters, where they had that Drederick Tatum vs Secretariat fight
Oh my goodness.

Fuck Jon "Roided out Coke Head" Jones. He deserves a lifetime ban. 4 Fucking chances?!?!! If I fucked up at my job I may get one more chance but sure as hell not 4!
Alright, so what if when an athlete gets "stripped" of a title for PED, they actually televise the entire process of stripping the athlete of the belt in a large ceremony that is the opposite of winning the belt and have it placed on the fighter. 

Don't get it twisted, I'm not trying to see this guy naked. What I'm saying is what if there was a Game of Thrones Cersei Lannister walk of shame like ceremony where the athlete has to admit to using performance-enhancing drugs or steroids in front of the opponent they beat and then they get stripped of the belt by the opponent. Then, they have to do walk of shame or other pro athletes get to yell "shame" "shame" "shame" at them while throwing protein shakes, hydroxicut pills and shit like that at them. 

Complete with an in octagon interview with Joe Rogan afterwards which I imagine would go something like:

"How's it feel to be a cheating piece of shit, and gettin' banned from the sport ya fuckin' loser"-Joe

"I'll tell ya Joe, not that great"-disgraced athlete 

"Anyone you'd like to thank?"-Joe 

"Yeah, uhh.. my trainer who said I could get away with it.. and uhhh. God"- disgraced athlete

AND they could pay per view that shit and make Dana White happy

I assure you there would be less cheating

Through all of this, I feel the worst for Cormier.
usada: "u still there pussy?"
You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, Jon. Well done.
Fucking idiot. 

Just give him a lifetime ban already.
Right after UFC 214,  he had an interview where he talked about doing things off steroids.   I pointed it out to a few co workers that it's weird for someone who is not using steroids to specify doing something off roids because that should be all the time.     

I just feel bad for DC,  especially for DC.  There's a guy who's only been beaten by one guy in his career, and he'll never know who'd win if they were both clean.    There will always be a what if.
I am unfathomably annoyed at this. I was rooting so much for DC on both occasions and both times Jon beat him. I was sad for DC, now i'm angry for DC. Jones robbed DC's opportunity for a fair fight on both occasions. Sickening behaviour from the supposed greatest UFC fighter of all time. My arse. 
You idiots. Don't you see this is just another test by God for Jon? Jeez calm down already.
I hope Jon Jones gets another rematch with drugs. They keep kicking his ass

USADA: You still there Pussy?
Fuck I hate this. DC was heartbroken and wanted it so bad just to lose to a fucking cheater. 
Haha we know he definitely hid under the cage at jackson a few years ago. No surprise, with his brother getting busted with the same drug as jones 1st failed test.

Lots of money + NFL connections + brother testing positive + no morals + 2 positive tests = A level shitbag

Steroids- " hey pussy are you still here?"

ban him for life.  the guy doesnt get it or doesnt care.
Jon Jones might be the biggest idiot in the UFC
After the story about him hiding under the octagon when USADA showed up and stayed there for hours. Even pissed under there. Plus he popped for anti-estrogen before ufc 200, what you take when you cycle off steroids. Now he popped for anabolic steroids. I think it's clear he's been cheating his entire career. Remember, he has brothers in the NFL, which also popped for PED's. They probably gave him bad info on how much he can take and how long to cycle off to avoid popping. Either way, the point of this comment was to convince the delusional fans who believe Him when he says and his team says he's been set up. Convince you that he has been lying to you all, like Ryan Braun, crying and pleading his innocence. I believed Ryan, I half believed Jon.
"The Russians hacked my supplements again."
-- Jon Jones
I know it'll never happen, but I wish DC could sue Jones for his entire purse.

DC received a potentially life altering headkick by Jones, whose performance was greatly enhanced by using PEDs for the second time. His career could have been ended, he lost out on a ton of money and fame, and now Jones deserves to never fight again for this.

He is a horrible human and I hope to never see him part of the mma community again. Anyone who is a fan of him after this is just as scummy.
He's been roided up. So damn ignorant to think otherwise. Two brothers in the nfl, coke head, estrogen blockers, ripped af.. good riddance

 Let's give him the benefit of the doubt, guys.   He may have thought it was cocaine. 
"Steroids by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day". 
But in all seriousness, how does he expect to get away with it. He's not stupid and I'm not going to accept the 'tainted' supplements again. Dana has every right to not have a relationship with him and he well and truly has spit in the face of every fan that backed him. Shame that Cormier will still not receive the credit that he deserves. 
Jon, I am unliking your page on fb ... NEVER TALK TO ME AGAIN
So, we're good to go on a roided up Jones vs roided up Lesner superfight, right?
Cowboy did it again man... he hinted Jones wasn't clean AGAIN, and may possibily be right once again. USADA, hire Cowboy to sniff out cheaters.

I really wish mma could be clean.

Honestly, if you want to run faster, jump higher, cycle further, lift heavier - go ahead. I'll never particularly like the fact that PED use is so prevalent in sport but it doesn't offend me like it does here.

Those shots DC took to the dome were absolutely brutal. PEDs have no place when people's lives are literally at risk every fight. 
BUT GUYS

He is a changed man didnt you hear he say so?!

Man jones loves him some chemicals. 

Him and Lesnar should have a full on roided up mma fight. 
In the build up to this fight everyone was saying "Don't get excited until the Octagon door closes!" 

We are never safe. Even 3 weeks after the fight. 
So they're good ng to go with the "I was tricked, why would I take a steroid before weigh ins." But the twist is just so that when they can use that storyline in the WWE: 

he eventually fights Lesnar at Summer Slam or whatever Lesnar beats him and standing over him he takes the mic and says "It was ME, Jon! I gave you the T-Bol!" Which then sets up the rematch at whatever comes after Summer Slam etc.
I defended him forever. I gloated and mocked a ton of you.

No more. I'm sorry to everyone I was rude to. I was wrong defending him.

If this is true fuck him. 
It's official, DC is the P4P greatest light heavy weight champion of all time
I tried to leak this here 2 weeks ago when my buddy at the CASC informed me the B sample had been requested but Mods deleted like 3 threads I made.  They could have blown the story wide open right here on reddit.
DC is the undefeated light heavyweight Champion of the world. Only person he's ever dropped a round to other than Jones in 21 pro fights has been Gus, and it's now obvious Jones cheated in both of those fights.. He should be seriously talked about when we talk about the GOATS of our sport. Fuck Jon jones.
It is my sincere hope that if Jon Jones actually concussed DC at UFC 214, that DC hires a lawyer and sues Jones, Dana White, UFC, and WME for every dime he can squeeze out of them.

Suspensions is not the way to stop needle fighters; taking their money is. You piss hot, you forfeit 100% of your fight purse. THE END.
This will get buried but my friend and I were play wrestling and I was wearing basketball shorts and I got a random boner from grappling eachother
The sad part is Daniel got his head kicked the fuck in bad.  That kind of concussion stuff adds up, and the aftermath of multiple knockouts in a career is not fun.  He's got a family, he's an analyst, he's got things to do when he hangs up his gloves.

No one deserves to be in the ring taking punches and kicks from a man with the testosterone of three grown men.

For the sake of DC's, Mark Hunt's and other fighters health and longevity, get to the bottom of this.
[Jon Jones will never change](http://i.imgur.com/ml4PiG1.jpg)
Easy guys it's not his fault, this time his steroids were tainted with dick pills
You think I'm just gonna stand there and let you take turinabol Jon?
UFC 182: Abnormal T levels, Cocaine.

UFC 200: Estrogen Blockers/T level Enhancers

UFC 214: Steroids


Remember that "Who's going to beat Jon Jones" thread? [I said it'd be Jon Jones](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/6qy0mv/whos_going_to_beat_jon_jones/dl1urpi/). That was an easy prediction, but even I didn't think it'd be so soon.

 "We are all at a complete loss for words right now. Jon, his trainers, his nutritionists and his entire camp have worked tirelessly and meticulously the past 12 months to avoid this exact situation."

They really don't think before they speak. 
#DC STILL THE CHAMP OH FUCK
Danis is firing from the hip - https://twitter.com/dillondanis/status/900164475617259520
This ruined my night. Huge Jon Jones fan and he goes and does this shit. How egotistical do do you have to be to think that you can beat USADA?????? FUCK.

This is disgraceful. I looked up that roid to convince myself it was just for injury recovery or some shit but no....take a look https://www.steroid.com/Oral-Turinabol.php

It's a clear steroid for athletes. Made him stronger, increased stamina, etc....


FUCK
Jon Jones tests positive for still being a scumbag.
After watching 214 and Jon Jones' post-fight interview, I was almost convinced Jon had turned his life around.

***Almost***
I'm not surprised motherfuckers.

Did anybody seriously believe he suddenly stopped being a cheating piece of shit? 
Oh I would like to see faces of all those DC haters who shared DC crying after the match. Your hero Jones is more like a villain.
As a Jon Jones fan I'm so fucking shocked, it wasn't only that he beat DC but he came out of the darkness, he achieved his dreams of coming back and becoming the champion once again and now turns out everything was a lie, all the things he said about never giving up, all the interviews he had, all the people he "inspired" (including me), just everything... how can he even sleep knowing all the shit he did? all the damage DC received, all the fans he betrayed, all the people he disappointed. 

This is over Jones, as a fan of his this still hurts me a lot but I'll make sure to suppress my feelings and just forget this fucking lier, junkie and CHEATER. Burn in hell forever Jon Cheater Jones.

DC is the one and only.
Now we know that the OSP Jon Jones is the clean one.
In two separate tests conducted a year apart, Jones has tested positive for:

Hydroxy-clomiphene, an anti-estrogenic agent,

Letrozole, commonly used to treat gyno caused by steroid use,

and Turanibol, which Frank Mir popped for, an outright anabolic steroid.

He's done. 

These drugs, which go together perfectly, don't just happen to end up your body. 
>We are all at a complete loss for words right now. Jon, his trainers, his nutritionists and his entire camp have worked tirelessly and meticulously the past 12 months to avoid this exact situation.

might as well just admit it
Honest question, if this is all true, are there legal actions that can be taken by DC or the UFC?

IMHO it seems like if I'm having to recover from a knock out head kick from someone who cheated, perhaps I'm entitled to more compensation than just a decision reversal.
I guess Brock vs Jones will be at Wrestlemania 34 instead of UFC 222. 
Well this spices up the GOAT conversation. Jones is out imo - who knows how long he's been doing this bullshit.

I feel for DC too. He's a legitimate champion and probably my pick for GOAT but the conversation is definitely more open than it was yesterday. 
"I tripped, fell, and accidentally ingested anabolic steroids."
In the immortal words of Nick Diaz - "all you motherfuckers are on steroids"
RIP JJ comeback. 2017-2017
All of the god damn shit that Daniel Cormier had to go through with this mother fucker. Devastated by his loss, only to find out that the fucker was using steroids!? Good fucking grief, I can't even imagine how Cormier must be feeling. 
[Lol, Michael Chiesa just deleted this tweet about it](https://i.gyazo.com/c21ed68f1c235385519856379ef691d4.png)

EDIT: He posted it again
[deleted]
Jon Jones should just make like a tree and fuck off. Every fucking time
Dick Pills 2: Electric Boogaloo. 
Frozone head ass retard dick fuck
Once a cheater, always a cheater. Scumbag
JJ now stands for Just Juicin'.
Not the GOAT, but by FAR the biggest waste of talent we've ever seen in MMA.
Jon Jones isn't even 30 and he should already be eligible to win a "Cannot Get the Fuck Out of His Own Way" Lifetime Achievement Award.
If true, kick him out the sport. End of. 
What a shitter for Cormier. He genuinely looked crushed at his loss, and now to find out that after chance 3 or 4, jones is still a cheat. I'm with him, "how many chances are they gonna give this guy".
Jones vs Lesnar in Rizin confirmed.
>"We are having the samples tested again to determine the validity or source of contamination."

Hey I found the source of the contamination, it's Jon Jones' piss.
Strip him of the title, ban him from the sport and be done with him once and for all. No more second chances

It's not true I didn't do it I didn't take steroids... I did nooot. Oh hai mark hunt
Guys I need Mark Hunt to make sense of this all for me...
Screw it. Time for a full on roided out super fight with Brock Lesnar. Let them both juice. 
Jesus Christ, Jon. My heart seriously goes out for DC right now. 
Man i feel like such an idiot for being one of those "he's changed" people. Done supporting him, done believing his bullshit. He's a tool.
Are. you. fucking. kidding. me???!!!!!!

I got ripped in this sub when I put it on DC, and after the fight the whole sub lit up claiming Bones is GOAT. I'm not even sure what to say about this individual anymore. If he claims ignorance, I'll lose it.

I'm almost certain Dana has zero time left for him anymore.

Disgrace. You're a goddamn extraordinary specimen by nature. Why do this? You already won the genetic lottery.
Turinabol is a plain old fashioned muscle building steroid. No tainted supplements bs is gonna fly with this.
Jon Jones got popped for steroids. He said that he's shocked and had no idea there there were steroids in his cocaine. 
Take his belt, take his career then take him to court and take back all his fucking money.  Leave this motherfucker empty.  END THIS SHIT DANA!  I'm sick of this mother fucker.  He won me back over with his lies and the costume he wears.  Never again.  SEND THAT PIECE OF SHIT TO MARS!
I hope we can all just recognize DC as the 205 GOAT from here on out and really just forget about Jon and the Jon v DC fights. Can't really count the losses against a cheater like Jon, who has probably been doping his entire professional career.
They should let Jon and Brock take a fuck loads of steroids and fight to the death.
[deleted]
Lets be real, it wasn't just DC that he cheated to beat.  He had super suspect elevated test levels before, then the boner pills thing, and now this.  Dude has 2 NFL players for brothers, and shares a gym with several people who have been popped and some very suspect people who haven't.  He built his name in an era when testing was far more relaxed and cheating was a lot easier to get away with.  He's likely been on the gear his entire career.  If I had to guess, the only clean fight he's ever had was against OSP, and it showed.

Of course we don't know for 100% sure, but what's more likely?  That Jon Jones is some kind of superhuman freak who became the GOAT all natural and just started using gear right around the time the UFC signed a contract with USADA, or that Jon Jones was always a fraud who dominated everybody by combining talent, a naturally advantageous physique, and a bunch of illicit substances?
Poor Cormier.

Knocked out for the first time ever to lose his title to some dude who cant adhere to the rules..

Tar and feathers for Jones!
#
Pull him off the P4P board.

Never mention his name in the GOAT discussion.

Nothing but a fucking fraud.

Tarnishing the sport.
I want my fuckin money back that I lost betting on DC

fuck you, Jon Jones
Goddamnit Jon, how can you keep justifying the terrible shit that you do? What the fuck, you had a chance to not be who everyone thought you were and all you did was make yourself worse than that. What the fuck, Jon
[https://twitter.com/TomTayMMA/status/900157925817282561](https://twitter.com/TomTayMMA/status/900157925817282561)
Well the good thing here is that they are actually testing fighters. Doesn't matter how big of a star you are, if you cheat, you're going down. 
What a fucking idiot. He had the MMA world in the palm of his hands three times and threw it away. Ban him for life. 
A very dark moment for the UFC. Jones was essentially in
 the position to vindicate the sport and failed both it and himself. 

Let his spend the rest of his days at the wall.
I said it three times and I will say it again. Fuck Jon Jones. He is the definition of a cheater. I hate his fake ass personality. He honestly should be banned for life.
Jon Jones may have been using steroids from the very beginning of his career.
Mike tyson take note, THIS is how you throw a talented career in the shitter
Jones confirms that his greatest opponent is himself. I knew you could fuck it up, Jon!
Looks like Jon Jones vs Brock in RIZIN. 
Jon Jones undefeated versus Jon Jones.
He was about to make bank with lesnar too lol. Fucking loser. I feel so bad for D.C. Now :( 
Brock vs Jones in Rizin. Have both of them both roided up to the max !!
I owe an apology to all the Aldo fans I used to argue against, saying that Jones had a better legacy and more claim to GOAT status.
Well, I hope they at least take him out of EA UFC 3. I'm tired of dealing with that reach advantage.
I knew he shouldn't have been king of the  north. It's Bran's by birthrite.
The fact it was a horrific knockout with multiple monster blows to the danger spot behind the ear after the head kick makes this news especially disturbing.  
Maybe now you won't get downvoted for stating the obvious, he is and always was an obvious juicehead. Should be banned for life. 
I hope DC gets his belt back, goes on one more title reign and defends 1-2 times and hangs up the gloves. He's the real champ, and now everything Jones has done in the octagon is put into question. It's a shame Jones couldn't stay clean, but this is exactly what DC needs. 
Now I see why he challenged Brock Lesnar
Just start a steroid league up again in Japan.  If they wanna do it, let em do it.
Jon Jones is going to go down as the biggest waste of talent in MMA.
Super disappointed. Makes all that holier than thou bullshit aura he had before the fight go to bullshit. Look, I understand alot of athletes do PED's, but shit, even they are smart enough to not get caught once, let alone twice. He was truly a talent, but it's over for him.
Jones' full career has to be called into question now. There's literally no way he starts using just for that fight considering all the controversy in the 2/3 years before it. Why just take the risk now? What a fuckin scumbag
[I fucking love Twitter ](http://i.imgur.com/xz2E8j2.jpg)
The Fertita's must be loving that $4 billion buyout right about now
Lesnar vs. Jones: The War on Drugs
is it possible there's a mistake? i know he's done some dumb shit but... this is like the equivalent of getting arrested for grand theft auto and the day you get out of prison you go steal a cop car from the police station and drive around the city going 120 mph pulling people over. like he had to know he was going to be tested a ridiculous amount by usada leading up to that fight after just getting off suspension for tainted supplements. not only that, he had already fucked up so much... like what? i know he's made some insanely dumb decisions but this would be next level. this would be the most ridiculously dumb thing in sports history considering his talent level
AAAAAAAAAND STILL THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION ! DAAAAANIEEEEL CORNIEEER !!! 
This just makes the Lesnar-Jones fight make more sense though amiright?!
I don't think I will ever pay to see Jon Jones fight again.  Daniel Cormier should be awarded the entire purse retroactively.  He was the only man in the octagon.  Jon Jones should go into hiding and never come out.
i saw him with fight milk 
Nate Diaz truly was right.
Ban him for life. This isn't his first time. 
Jon Jones needs to sue his dick pill provider.
I think I hate him. Feel so bad for Cormier man. Ugh.
Stay off the roads in Abq tonight folks
I said from the moment the fight got announced, I'm not getting excited until they're in the ring and everyone's piss has been tested.

Little late but same result.

[called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/6mxj6h/its_going_to_be_a_long_5_weeks_for_fans_of_actual/dk612ll/)
I NEED MY MONEY THAT I BET ON DC 
Jones came from my hometowns highschool, we basically disowned him long ago
In my eyes, you can never be a GOAT using PEDs. Respect to the clean fighters. 
Yeah, take drugs before your first fight, after a year ban... they won't suspect a thing -_-
Knew he was on roids after he said he trained 4! times a fucking day. Thats imposdible.
What a bastard. The UFC need to make an example of him and ban him from fighting for life. 
Congrats DC
At least we have something to talk about except Conor and Floyd
When champion level fighters pop, I expect it to be for something I never even heard in my life. Tbol, though? Might as well have walked out with a needle sticking from his butt.
I'm not a sports gambler, so I have a question for anyone who is. How do bookies handle something like this if it is called a no contest. Are they required to give people who placed money on Cormier, their money back even though a couple of weeks have passed? What happens to people who cashed out after bettingg on Jones? Lucky them? They already got their winnings and too bad for the bookies? 
Jones Vs Lesnar, battle of the naturals
FFS

*This* is why I couldn't get behind him for his last fight. I've thought the man's been a scumbag for years. He's just happy to prove my point. Over and over. 
A Diaz brother said something about this....
I want Jon Jones to lower me into my grave, that way he can let me down one last time. 
I'm laughing at all you fuckers that defended him saying he's changed after one goddamn fight. 
Jones and lesnar in Japan let's do this.
I feel like Jon Jones is Chris Brown and MMA fans are Rihanna.
Just ban the fucker for life. No fighter in the ufc has ever been given as many chances as him.
My Mrs haaaaaaaaates JbJ and said after the hit and run he needed to be scrubbed from history. She is dancing round the kitchen at this news calling him all the cunts under the sun hahahaha
What an idiot. There's no coming back from this now. Is this his last strike?
