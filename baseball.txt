I don't even know who Mike Trout is but have greatly enjoyed looking at these every day. God speed /u/DidItForTheStory.
They couldn't even have held it to 100 days to make it a nice round number, could they? Fuck the owners.
Don‚Äôt be sad because it‚Äôs over. Be happy because it happened. ü•≤
I don‚Äôt care about baseball, except now i do becuase of this series. i‚Äôm a new fan, thanks
Rest now good and faithful servant of baseball.

You done good.
I'm from /r/all so I don't know who Mike Trout is but I've been enjoying your posts and I will miss you.
My god you draw fast
I don't know what the lockout means because I'm from EU and r/all but I will miss seeing these everyday when I wake up.
BLESS YOU
I don‚Äôt know who Mike Trout is or what a lockout does, nor do I follow any kind of Baseball, but boy howdy have I loved seeing these pictures on my feed each day.
We made it!!!
End of an era. Thank you for your service
Love the Easter egg to an earlier Trout
Milk steak for everyone
Lets go!! Best one yet
Truly, thank you for doing this. You‚Äôre a real fucking guy.
You drew this fucking thing 3 months ago and have been sitting on it. You magnificent bastard.
I love how this post is how I find out
I‚Äôm gonna miss you üò¢
I don't even watch baseball, and these were amazing. Damn you baseball for doing whatever you did that made these stop.
EVERYONE GET IN HERE!
97 DAYS OF LOCKOUT FINALLY OVER

THANKS FOR KEEPING US A LITTLE MORE SANE
HISTORY
this is the most beautiful thing i‚Äôve ever laid eyes on
Thank you for keeping us sane through the lockout
While I don't know anything about baseball, I've seen you on r/all every single day for the past months. I respect your dedication and consistency. The sky's the limit my friend
This is lovely! Perfect last drawing!
You were my sunshine, my only sunshine.
Thank you for everything
I WAS HERE I LOVE MY MOM
No idea who Mike Trout is, never did find out what the lockout was about, but I have bloody LOVED these posts, and I will miss them dearly.
absolute legend, and I don't even watch baseball <3
I don't even know anything about this topic, but your place on the Reddit front page will be missed.
You will be missed and forever be in r/baseball infamy, you beautiful artist
u/DidItForTheStory I looked forward to your posts everyday, thank you so much for making a crappy time so much fun!
Goodnight, sweet prince....

Such a bittersweet day but we all hoped it was coming. Thanks for everything u/DiditForTheStory !
You‚Äôve done more to publicize Mike Trout in the last 97 days than the MLB has done his entire career.
You had this one ready since day one, huh?
I love you and u/melcolnik so much. Thank you both for making this lockout brighter for all of usüíï
Not even a member of the subreddit but this has been coming up in my feed since the beginning, sad to see it go
O captain my captain.
Man, I don't know who you are, or who Mike Trout is, but I will miss seeing you on r/all
These need to be a coffee table book in remembrance of this time
Are you publishing a coffee table book??
Omg this is the cover of the book
End of a fucking Era! You have been amazing and they should immortalize you in the baseball hall of fame. Thank you for everything!
I have no idea who Mike Trout is! 

But ive been following this drawing series so much that in my mind he must be some type of legendary figure of myth and not real at all!
"If you draw it, they will come"

Let's go! Looking forward to seeing some Mike Trout drawings at an Angels game soon.
WHERE IS THE SLOTH
You can rest now, sweet prince!!
THEY WILL COME AND SO HAVE I
You eased the pain the whole way, bro. I mean it.
Thank you for getting me through all this
Gave me a positive reason to check in during the lockout. Thank you for your service.
You had this in the fucking bank huh lol
I'm glad that this is how I found out. After these months I wouldn't want it any other way.
The only downside to baseball coming back is losing these.  

Can you start a series of drawing Mike Trout every day until the Angels win the pennant or something?  I'd appreciate these being a thing in perpetuity.
I don‚Äôt even give a shit about baseball but I‚Äôve enjoyed seeing your drawings on r/all so often. I‚Äôll miss seeing them. Much love!
As an r/all lurker i loved these and upvoted every one i saw.
End of the best part of my day for 3+ months
What a finale
I LOVE YOU
I want these as legit baseball cards.
PRAISE THE BASEBALL GODS
Small shame this wont reach 100
I love that this was my first source of learning that baseball is back lol. Thanks for keeping us entertained!
Publish a book, the work is already done! As your manager I‚Äôll just take 40%.
I know nothing about baseball, I have no clue who Mike Trout is, but I will genuinely miss your drawings every day.
What a moment in baseball history. I'll be able to tell my grandkids about witnessing /u/Diditforthestory drawing 97 masterpieces in as many days, in this, the year of ~~our lord~~ Mike Trout, 2022
YOU THE REAL MVP u/diditforthestory
u/diditforthestory this is the top post of all time on r/baseball! CONGRATS!

I FUCKING LOVE YOU DAWG ‚ù§Ô∏è
GLORIOUS
Thank you sincerely for giving me a reason to check this sub every day. A true joy every post.
Forever a legend.
You can rest now.
This is so beautiful.
Thank you!
Beautiful champ!

I guess this means jomboy is back to his regular programming... Not sure if I'm happy or sad about it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I get it, but I will miss you, Sweet Prince.
My mom always looked forward to these drawings. You‚Äôve reached a lot of people by doing something as simple as drawing Mike Trout, and yet, you made it complex and interesting to where it was always a thing to look forward to. DidItForTheStory, thank you.
I'll ask again, when is the 97 page coffee table book being released??
Loved these during this horrible time, your a üçë.
This actually choked me up a bit my friend.

Well done.
This is perfect!
üòçüòçüòç
I FUCKING LOVE YOU MAN
WE HAVE DONE IT
**LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO**
My longest yea boi ever (Rob Manfred laugh bass boosted)
Thank you for making all of this bearable.
About to become most upvoted post ever in this sub
what a boss....thank you SO MUCH for carrying us through this mess.....
What a ride.
Print the shirts!!
NUT
Just waiting with the finger in the trigger with this final gem of the offseason!

Thanks for giving us something positive on a daily basis despite the snip snap, snip snap of the negotiators!
WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU TROUT HIMSELF?
Thank you for your effort and your commitment. I really hope you keep drawing after this. You've built up quite a talent.
I‚Äôm just upset e lockout is over because there was no Calvin and Hobbs drawing
You will forever be a hero in the lore of baseball
So many mixed emotions. Please, use your art to summarize each week of the season.
ART.
Thank you sir
Thank you for your service.
thank you for your service
Thank you for your art.
I love you man. I‚Äôm gonna miss these.
A true hero
We love you so much, thank you
Fucking legend.
It‚Äôs beautiful ü•≤
This drawing belongs in the hall
You saved the league
I am so glad to have been apart of this. Thank you for the greatest entertainment I have got from the MLB in years.
Hadn‚Äôt been watching the news today, opened Reddit and saw this post.

There is no better way of hearing about the end of the lockout!

Thank you for 97 days of entertainment!
Real MVP here.  üôè
God damn why‚Äôd this make me sad the lockout was over lol

Been an honour, I‚Äôve honestly loved seeing your drawing skills develop
I am so happy I was here for this journey
I'm gonna miss this... You the real MVP /u/diditforthestory üèÜ‚úä
Thus has been an amazing journey. Thank you
I'm both too late and a nobody who follows baseball from Ireland, but I miss r/diditforthestory every day
I still don't know who Mike Trout is but I'm gonna miss these.
Now that this is on the front page of Reddit, can someone explain to me who Mike Trout is? I've been following the cartoons whenever they hit r/popular and by now I'm too afraid to ask.
And on the 97th day he rested. 

Well done u/DidItForTheStory
I don't know baseball I don't know who Mike trout is but damnit this is the end of an era
Congrats on the top post of all time for /r/Baseball!
[https://i.imgur.com/pt7iuCz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pt7iuCz.jpg)
Simply incredible, I will happily buy a book or prints of these if you put them up /u/diditforthestory
Just want you to know OP. You were the first person I thought of when the lock out ended.
Not ready to say goodbye, OP. 
Think I‚Äôll go buy more of your shirts. (Day 45 is going to be in tatters, I wear it so much) Thank you so much for ‚Ä¶ all of this ü•≤
Let‚Äôs go now it‚Äôs the most upvoted post on r/baseball
I can't believe it's finally over. God-fucking-speed, dude. I hope you keep drawing in your own time even now that the lockout's over.
Awesome work, thank you for the entertainment.
It's over

It's finally over
Glad to have been here every day for this. Thank you.
It‚Äôs beautiful üòç
All the feels.
Sir, it‚Äôs been an honor.
WE WILL MISS YOU
BO! ‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you so much for your service
You beautiful bastard.
This is gold
i just know day 100 would‚Äôve been crazy good. thanks for giving us something to look forward to, op ü•≤
Thank you for your service!
this is great

your progress has been great

I love you
Your watch now is ended.
dude this being the last drawing is making me legitimately cry

these drawings and threads have just been amazing. Thank you so much.
I‚Äôm not a member of this sub, I don‚Äôt even watch baseball (I‚Äôm from the UK and already follow the NBA, following two sports at once might break my sleeping schedule to an irreparable degree) but I checked this sub every day for the Mike Trout drawings.  It was a fun highlight to end the day as it usually dropped just before I went to bed.  Thank you for your hard work, good sir.
RIP u/DidItForTheStory's amazing art!! RIP Wade Boggs
In the end, he DidItForUs üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
I just want to say that you have kept this sub so alive throughout the lockout more than any player, owner, or journalist could do. 


You‚Äôve improved so much and this has been fun. I think I can speak for all of us to say we are all endlessly thankful for your work and dedication to this to bring some join for us while we waited for our beloved sport to return. Thank you
thank you. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 

You have brought so much joy through such a dark passage. I hope you will grace us again one day with more drawings and if you ever write a book, I will be first in line to purchase.

You can rest now, King. You deserve it.
I‚Äôve enjoyed these every day but seeing Judge in this one made me extra happy.
Tape my nipples to a drill bit and start spinnin baby!!! Hell ya!!
I don't baseball, but I have greatly enjoyed these posts. I have to imagine these drawings are the reason the lockout ended. Congratulations on ending the lockout u/DidItForTheStory. I hope you're called upon to throw out a first pitch somewhere. That I would watch.
Literally the only reason I know there was a lockout is from your daily posts (on r/all). And for some reason I think I'm gonna miss them.
Thanks for the guaranteed daily chuckles.
I dont even follow the baseball subreddit but I swear I saw your drawings every single day. Keep up the art mah friend!
A field of Memes
I was here
Thanks for your service. You'll be missed.
Rest King. You carried this sub more than you should've. Thank you
This is how I found out lmao
It's fitting that this post how I learn it's over. Thanks for making this off-season a little brighter.
You did it.  You crazy son of a bitch, you did it!
Top post in Reddit's history incoming.
End of an era. Was a pleasure
Legendary post. I was here.
Today, we say goodbye to a true legend.
What an absolute legend!
I‚Äôve never once seen a game of baseball all the way through. But I‚Äôve seen everyone of your posts. Thanks for the little light in my feed these last few months.
Awesome the way you stuck to it. Good on ya.
You have been a bright spot in my internet consumption the past 97 days. Thank you!
They will say that OP DidItForTheStory but he really did it for the love of the game and the true spirit of baseball.    Uniting fans from all teams (even the Mariners) together with his daily art pieces.    These dark months would not be the same without you, u/DidItForTheStory, and for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I was just telling my wife last week I look forward to the daily Mike Trout drawings.

Now I have nothing to look forward to (because I don't watch sports).

But hey, it was fun while it lasted and thank you for making it fun for those of us that don't watch baseball!
I don't watch baseball and have no idea who Mike Trout is but I've happened across 32 of your drawings according to the number next to your name. :p
My dude, everyone I know does not care 1 bit about baseball but all of us know the "Mike Trout Artist". Godspeed you beautiful man.
I pay no attention to baseball and have no idea the relevance of any of these drawings, but I've been seeing them on the front page for so long - good on you for your dedication!
I don't follow baseball at all and have no idea what this has been about, but I'm still going to miss these popping up every day.
This is exactly how I wanted to find out the lockout was over. I just didn't know it until it happened!
Hey man, thanks for keeping us all entertained/sane with your doodles. Now go back and play some baseball Mike.
Man this has been a wild ride watching all these drawings.

Great work, and I am amazed you kept having so many ideas to keep this up.
beautiful finale.

I hope the coffee table/coloring book makes you a million bucks.
What a journey, here since day 1!
I've upvoted every single one of your posts, daily. Thank you for the fun.
Absolutely majestic bookend to magical run.
u/DidItForTheStory thank you so much. You delivered every single day. You‚Äôre the Cal Ripken of the lockout, and deserve a first round spot into the Reddit Hall of Fame
I'm glad this was how I learned the lockout is over. This was an amazing journey.
Mods give this legend his own flair.
I‚Äôve had a crazy day at work with no down time‚Ä¶ I LOVE that this is the way I learned that the lockout is over!
Field of Memes
Yeah I‚Äôve never commented but have been following the art everyday and have shared it with my baseball nerd homie. Love this for the final piece! 

BASEBALL IS BACK BABY.
Plot twist: these have to end because Mike Trout himself has actually been drawing them and he now has to report to Spring Training
Much like Mike Trout, /u/diditforthestory is the MVP
I just want to say thank you. It‚Äôs truly been a wonderful ride. I will always hold a special place in my heart for these cartoon drawings of a baseball player done by a random guy on Reddit.
What a long strange trip it‚Äôs been. 

Your watch has come to an end. Please enjoy some peanuts and cracker jacks.
97 days, very impressive, well done!
These posts single handedly made the off-season far more fun than it had any right to be. If there is some sort of Reddit hall of fame, these posts should be unanimous, first ballot inductees.
Your whole adventure here was amazing to watch,  and added much needed levity to a very, very frustrating time. You deserve the fame you've gotten. Thank you for your efforts and time.
Your commitment is inspiring my friend.
Hi idk baseball or who Mike trout but I loved your drawings, saw em every day on /all. Gl to you in your future endeavors
Fantastic finale! This "Draw-Mike-Trout-Experiment" was ridiculous and funny and I loved it. And I'm not even a baseball fan. Well done, DidItForTheStory!
No idea who Mike trout is, no idea what a lock out is but I'm kinda sad to see it over. I'll miss you in r/all
I saw that the lockout was over on the news, thought of you, and told my boyfriend about your art and that it has gotten really good!
Wait I know nothing about baseball but what the duck am I going to do without these posts on r/all every day?
#ABSOLUTE LEGEND

I've said this a few times before, but I really truly hope Trout was following these (or at the very least, someone was sending them to him).
Over 1,000 awards wow thanks for the ride u/diditforthestory
Thank you u/DidItForTheStory 

I hope you never have to do it again my dude
Thank you, you one-man army Legend!
That is what you call the closer
I teared up a little bit ngl. Good luck with your future endeavors good sir! Here‚Äôs to another year of mediocre Angels baseball while you have two of the best players in the league on your team!
So you‚Äôre going to make a coffee table book with all these drawings?
Not a baseball fan. But looking at these pictures have been a great part of my day. I hope you actually get this last one autographed by Mike trout
I dont watch baseball , but been following your work. This is by far my favorite. Thank you for the chuckles.
Thank you so much for this incredible journey!
I‚Äôm British and have never watched a single baseball game, but seeing these illustrations each day on all has given me a weird sense of joy for the longest time.
Thanks
Thank you for your service!
What an absolutely positive way to endure this saga. Well done, you!
Thank you for helping us get by. Hopefully Mike Trout will reach out to you for your service. üôè
Top shelf, broheem.
That was an amazing journey. Your skills improved with each drawing. Bravo!
This is BEAUTIFUL! It‚Äôs been a long journey but a fun one. Your drawings cheered me up in these dark times. Thank you u/diditforthestory
Don‚Äôt cry because it‚Äôs over üò¢, smile because it happened
Dale Murphy is my dad and was one of the greats. Today is his last chance to make it into the Hall of Fame. I made this comic to show how I feel about it.

Your dad was my favorite player as a kid. My mom got me a signed ball for my 5th birthday.

‚ÄúBest wishes Marc.

Dale Murphy‚Äù

It‚Äôs still on my bookshelf.
My Dad played with your dad! (Ron Gant) Glad to see you on here. Good luck!

Edit:Holy cow thank you everyone for sharing your memories of my father. It really does mean a lot to me and I want to answer all of your comments but I‚Äôm so overwhelmed lmao. Im going to show him all of this when gets back from vacation
He's already clearly a Hall of Fame dad and nothing can top that.
This is really cool. You have a great talent of your own.
This is TMI but I don‚Äôt care. 

I was born in ‚Äò80 in SC. My biological father killed himself on Groundhog‚Äôs Day ‚Äò81. 

As a boy, my two-year older brother and I watched all of the Braves games and completely idolized your father. 

Until my dad (step-father) came into the scene and married my mom in ‚Äò86, and adopted me and my brother in ‚Äò88, I always wanted your dad to some how swop into my life and become my father. 

I have several memories just thinking about your dad and watching him on tv, thinking, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs my dad, playing baseball for all the world to see! I hope he‚Äôll come home to see us, soon.‚Äù

Please tell your dad thanks for existing and being classy. To two kids he never knew, he was more than just our favorite player. He was an idea of what a man, a hero, and what we‚Äôd hope that a father could be. 

My dad (step-dad) is no world super-star like yours, but fortunately he is to me, my mom, my older brother, and, quickly thereafter, my little brother.
This is a beautiful work. I absolutely hope he gets in. The man deserves it.

Also, here's some proof to verify this is from Dale's son. I have no reason not to believe this is also his account.

https://deadspin.com/dale-murphys-son-drew-his-dad-this-heartwarming-cartoon-5969376?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&utm_source=deadspin_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow
I want him in based solely on this comic alone.
It‚Äôs so strange that Murph is the benchmark for so many HoF players (like Chipper), but he‚Äôs not in yet. 

I grew up a Braves fan a few years after your dad was gone, but hearing my mom and dad tell stories about him was amazing. My sister went dressed up as him for Halloween one year. 

Fingers crossed today.
My childhood hero. Please thank your Dad for his inspiring actions on and off the field for me. He‚Äôs the kind of role model a professional athlete should be.
r/baseball: But your dad only had 44 WAR.

Truth is your dad, in his day, was a superstar. He was constantly on television and was well received by the masses. He fell victim to a strike shortened season in his prime.

He‚Äôs much different than a guy like, let‚Äôs say, Larry Walker who averaged 116/g a year for his career and only played 150/g a season one time. Your dad did it 13 times. 

Better players have come since, and the steroid era made what your dad did seem small, but in his day he was a stud.

Hope he gets in.
My daddy loved Dale Murphy. I was three when they played the Cardinals in the 1982 NLCS. I don‚Äôt remember much except how cold it was and how much he loved watching him play. Fond memories. Much love to your father!
Dale Murphy is already in the Hall of Fame of our hearts. I like everything about the way he carried himself. Faithful but not preachy. He‚Äôs won almost every humanitarian award. For anyone now in their mid-forties who had TBS growing up, he is the epitome of a great baseball player.
You'll see how much he deserves to be in the HOF if he doesn't get in today. He won't complain or blame anyone, or lash out bitterly. He'll be humble and grateful anyway,  and that's why I, and so many, love him. 

Your dad is a Hall of Famer, whether or not the people who have been voting see it and make it official. Their loss. 

I grew up in Atlanta and had the privilege of seeing him play many times. It's an overused phrase now, but he is absolutely the hero we needed and still need.

Edit: Also if you haven't heard this [great song from the Baseball Project](https://youtu.be/WYqF--wQ3MU) (Mike Mills of REM side-project) you really need to!
I love Dale.  

I was at a Rome Braves week day game a few years ago. Not a lot of people there if I remember correctly it was raining and it was delayed a bit.

But after it started I saw Murph sitting behind home plate. I didn't want to bother him but I finally gave in and in between innings I rushed down there and asked for a picture and autograph. My son was 3ish at the time and my picture is of my kid blowing Murph a kiss. He signed a ball and shook my hand.

I went back up to the high part of 209 seating cause my kid likes to run around the seats and it was empty. I was up there texting my girlfriend pictures of us and Murph. All of a sudden here comes Dale Murphy walking up to my seats to give me my pen back. My cheap Bic pen, he walked back up to give it to me. And said I may need it again.

He is HoF in my book.

Edit - picture added http://imgur.com/a/mrnLxgz

Also an appearance by Touki , and Mike Soroka.
The reason your dad isn‚Äôt going to make the HoF is because of those tiny little legs, I mean can he ever support his own weight in those things? His biceps are six times the size of his thighs, it would be a miracle if he could get a swing off let alone down the baseline. You did this to him.

Voting criteria is as follows:

5) Voting: Voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.

Look, you can argue the first two, but there was hardly anyone in the game at his time that excelled him in the last 4. He deserves in.
Hey man - when I was a kid I wore a glove that had his signature in the palm (fake obviously). Didn‚Äôt know who he was at that time (late 90s), but I loved that glove and always remembered the name.

I recall before going out to the infield, I would always say things like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs do this Dale‚Äô 

It‚Äôs a stupid story, but felt compelled to share. Best of luck to your Dad.
Wow cool! Thanks for sharing
Between your dad and Don Mattingly. Two players I admired when I was a kid. I truly hope they get in! Tell your dad he still has a lot of fans out there.
[deleted]
Dale Murphy is an example of what is right with baseball. Sounds like he was a great dad as well.
I'm Irish so I know fuck all about baseball, but I want him to get in because of this comic
Annnnnnd I‚Äôm crying
Kid, I been saying your dad and other players from his era deserve to be in for years.  When I was a kid, he was one of the best in the game.  But the 90s came and the big homers of the era basically put your dad and many other guys in the background.  It's unfortunate but I'm glad they are getting another chance.  I really hope he gets in as much as my Yankeedom wants Munson and, my all-time fave, Mattingly in.
This is really amazing! I just finished making a short documentary style piece about him for the MLB Network and the one thing that came up the most in my research was how much everyone loved/respected him. 

He is probably the best player of the 1980‚Äôs And I hope for your family‚Äôs sake that he gets in the hall!
r/baseball before a nice comic: Dale Murphy had some nice years but definitely not a Hall of Famer. Short peak and only 46.5 bWAR.

r/baseball after the nice comic: Dale Murphy is a Hall of Famer for sure.
Two straight MVPs, 4 straight silver sluggers, 5 straight gold gloves.

How is this guy not in the hall of fame already?
Dale definitely skips leg day.
My dad has an autographed baseball from your dad.  

Best luck today for both of you!
My uncle tried out for the Braves many years ago. Made it through to the final round and it was finally down to him and one other guy... 

The other man beat him and went on to become one of the most beloved Braves players. My uncle went on to work in the family welding business. Lol. 

In a fun twist of fate, many years later, that same beloved Braves player moved in next door (or a couple of doors down, not sure) to another aunt and uncle of mine in Gwinnett County. Crazy small world! 

That other man and beloved player was your dad ‚Äî Dale Murphy! And all the Duke‚Äôs are still rooting for him üòä
Grew up with basic cable and TBS showing your dad carry some pitiful teams. He deserves in!
I had only ever heard his name a few times, but man looking up his stats, how does he continually get snubbed? .265 BA with 398 long bombs, 2 MVP's, 7 Silver Sluggers, on top of being a gold gloved fielder. If that's not a dang good career, I don't know what is
Looks like he didn't make it folks. Looks like updoots don't translate to real HOF votes
It's a shame that he hasn't been voted in yet. From everything I've reading, Today wasn't his *last* chance.  He will have an opportunity again in 2022.

I do like your comic!!
This is now the most upvoted post in /r/baseball history, just beating the announcement that the Cubs won the world series in 2016. Thought that was interesting.
I'm sorry he didn't make it. Your comic touched my heart and I was pulling for him. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Murph was my favorite player growing up as well!  My mom came home with a McGwire jersey one day(we live in the SF Bay Area). I got upset and made her return it for a Dale Murphy one. We used to watch all the Braves games on TBS. Would be a shame if he wasn‚Äôt a HOFer.
This is amazing üò≠
Dale Murphy and Don Mattingly are the two players that have been passed on by voters I was convinced they were Hall of Fame players when they played.
Fuck yeah!!! 
You dads signature was in my favorite mit for 25 years. Must‚Äôve played over 1,500 games with your dads name right on my palm.
We, as Braves fans, already hold him into the same light as Chipper Jones, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux, and the many other amazing Braves in the Hall of Fame.

He was a special player, and an even more special person. He was a hall of fame person, and it looks like a Hall of Fame dad.

I wish him good luck in getting in, but regardless, he should be extremely proud of what he did for every Braves fan since his start. 

Thank you Dale Murphy!
My dad was a human. He did everything he could to torture his family. I did everything I could to embrace him with love. He passed away last year from prostate cancer. Now he's just a pile of dirt. Moral of the story, go get your prostate check. Now, I need a hug.
Your dad is a beast in MLB the Show.
As a very casual baseball fan, why or how is there a last chance to be in the HoF?

EDIT: Damn guys, I literally don't know and google isn't helping. Was coming back hoping for a helpful answer not downvotes
nice!!
This is badass, OP.  Glad to hear he was a great father to you.
Dale Murphy was the only baseball player my baseball-loving friend loved. He drove around with Dale's Baseball Card on his instrument cluster in his truck.

I don't think my friend has ever been to the HoF and could give 2 shits about it.
..every single Braves game from the beginning of TBS...I loved Murphy! Thanks kid; best of luck to your dad.
Love Dale Murphy. As a young Atlanta sports fans there wasn‚Äôt much to cheer about. But he was different. I remember watching him play in the old Fulton County stadium. Tell your dad thank you from a young Braves fan whole idolized him in his youth.
Still have my Dale Murphy Signature glove and use it when I coach my son‚Äôs team every spring. Doesn‚Äôt provide much protection anymore but I‚Äôll never get rid of it. Love the guy, wish I had a vote!
 Big fan.. he should have been long ago.
As a Braves fan, i approve of this message.

Also as a human being, but that's less important these days.
Something tells me he‚Äôd prefer this comic to a plaque in the hall.  This is amazing.
This is a story you may not know about your dad (it also involves my dad). I remember it fondly because it is a reminder of how goofy and big hearted my dad was.

My dad had tons of foster kids before I was born. He always helped less fortunate kids and gave them experiences they might not get otherwise. He took a group of kids to an Atlanta Braves game and bought them all sunglasses for the game. These weren‚Äôt normal sunglasses, they were the big black sunglasses blind people or people who had eye surgery wear. They got their early to watch everyone warm up, and Dale Murphy, your dad, saw all these kids sitting in the stands with these big sunglasses on. Your dad (or someone) thought the kids were blind so they invited them onto the field to take pictures. My dad and the kids got pictures with all the Braves star players. I‚Äôm not sure where the picture is right now, but it is absolutely one of my favorite pictures.

So even if your dad doesn‚Äôt make the Baseball Hall of Fame, he is in my hall of fame for memories of my dad.
Can't believe it would be up for debate.  Dale Murphy was a heck of a player.
I‚Äôm a big fan if your dad. Thank him for the years of great baseball in Atlanta. He‚Äôs HOF in my book for sure. I seen him for the first time in 1985 at Fulton County Stadium. He‚Äôs an Atlanta Hero
Your dad, and those braves teams, are the reason I had any relationship with my father. We bonded over baseball, and that was enough to give us something.
My mom had the biggest crush on Dale Murphy when she was younger
Awesome. I hope he gets in!
My dad handed me down his glove from the 80's that he used for his work softball league.  Inscribed in the palm: Dale Murphy.  I used the thing in little league (1994-1999) until it ultimately fell apart.  Some asshat stole the glove from me during middle school baseball tryouts and tried to claim that he had bought it from Modells in '99.  The cop that patrolled the school told the kid there was no way he bought a Dale Murphy glove from Modells in 1999, so he gave it back to me.  It was my most favorite glove of all time.  Think your dad can spare another?
His wiki is the definition of wholesome baseball.
Beautiful tribute,mate.
I know your brother. He played college ball with one of my best friends at Utah State. We had many great times a few years ago


Edit: I actually think I met you when Shawn played for the Broncos
I don‚Äôt know anything about baseball so I‚Äôm sorry but I just wanted to say your style is amazing and I want to play a game in that style or watch a show that looks like that
I work at Suntrust Park in the summer between years of school, for people familiar with the park, I work mostly in the Home Depot Clubhouse, Below the Chop, and the Hank Arron Terrace. He has events for his family and charities at Suntrust a couple times a season in those areas and he is a really down to earth genuine guy, and very easy to talk to, just a cool guy who loves baseball and just enjoys meeting fans. Also, he‚Äôs still a freaking unit. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 about 180 and next to him I feel about 5‚Äô8 140, not very important but the caricature isn‚Äôt far off from real life.
I cheered your dad on at Fulton County Stadium as a young girl. I cheered for him as he was inducted into Braves HoF and retired his number during the last week at The Ted. 

I will cut a bitch if anyone ever says anything bad about Dale Murphy, Dale Murphy's stats and what Dave Murphy meant to Atlanta as a Braves player. Him and Herschel Walker were my childhood local sports heroes
The baseball love in here is inspiring.
I‚Äôm so sorry that your dad wasn‚Äôt able to make the hall today. I know it is hard for me to comprehend the disappointment felt in your family right now. I hope you can at least find joy in your dad being a hall of fame dad! Thoughts and prayers.
-me
Regardless of the outcome, happy for you to have such a great person in your life. Being a Hall of Fame dad is better than being a Hall of Fame baseball player.
.265/.346/.469 with 398 HRs, 2 MVPs, but just a 121 OPS+ and 46.5 bWAR... don‚Äôt think he makes the cut man, but I wish him the best
If your dad had played against my Padres for 162 games each year, he would have been a 1st ballot inductee. He just murdered my team.

Good luck to your dad!
I mean if Baines is in, why not Murphy? He may not be a Larry Walker but it wouldn't be the worst choice.
If Craig biggio is in Murphy should be in
This made me tear up.
Grew up watching him!
Your artwork is wonderful. Good luck!
My old man absolutely loved Dale Murphy. He‚Äôs the reason I wore the #3 in ball! Induct this legend!
Dale Murphy was my favorite baseball player as a kid. Him and Dale Earnhardt were the reason my favorite/lucky number is 3. He had an impact on me growing up just as a baseball player.
The first glove I ever owned was a Rawlings that had a Dale Murphy signature on the palm. I had that glove for years and my family still to this day laughs about how long I kept it and how bad it looked when I finally replaced it. I never got rid of it, I love that Dale Murphy glove.
Very relevant song: https://youtu.be/NWvkhzC014s
At Dodger Stadium in mid 80‚Äôs, my ~9 year old brother tosses Dale Murphy a ball to sign. He signs it, then turns around and starts walking away. My brother‚Äôs eyes get big as saucers, and when Dale turns around, he‚Äôs laughing really hard! He tosses the ball back to my brothers and moves on.

Good luck him, and you!
Your father was the first player I remember seeing in person at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium.  Lotsa good memories from a crappy era.  Unfortunately we traded him before the good times.  Hopefully he gets in.  Is your brother still in the NFL?
One of my all time favorite non A‚Äôs.  I watched so many Braves games on TBS back in the day.  Good times!  Your pop is a Hall of Famer in my book OP.
Your dad is the reason a young kid from NE PA became a Braves fan. Looks like he is a HOF dad as well. Good luck!!
I still have his rookie card. Been saving it since I was for almost 40 years
Amazing; I‚Äôm not even your father and it got me in my feels
I had father. But i never have a Dad.

What a great father you have.
Didn‚Äôt Harold Baines make it in the HOF? You can‚Äôt tell me Dale Murphy isn‚Äôt a hall of famer.
Dale Murphy deserves some consideration for not leaving the underperforming Braves for free agency with a richer and better team. I know HOF voters won't take that into account, but I wish they would. Yes, I know he was traded away after his steep decline, but that wasn't his choice.
It has s a crime he hasn't been in the HoF for years now
Heck of a ballplayer, impossible not to admire...and I'm a Mets fan no less.
I hope he makes it. A child in the 80‚Äôs, one of the reasons I started collecting baseball cards was because of Dale Murphy.
Right on man. Ya'll moved in to my ward in Alpine when I was  YM. Your dad was one of our YM leaders at the time. I had no clue about his baseball legacy...just that he played a bit of ball and some of the dads in the ward were geeking out him. I just remember him as a nice guy who was genuinely interested in us youth.
I never liked Dale, but that was because I am a Dodger fan. With that being said, I still think he deserves to go into the Hall. Hope he gets that vote.
My dad wore a number 3 because of your dad and I wore a number 3 because of my dad and my niece is 5 and started softball this year and wears a number 3 because of me. Your dads number has started a 3 generation long tradition in my family.
He deserves it. I have his rookie card. Good luck Murphy family!
How is Dale Murphy not already in the Hall of Fame???
Dale Murphy was one of the greatest men to play the game. I always thought that even before he came to the Phillies to finish his career. I wish he was able to come along for the ride with them in 1993, he could've been the difference for us. Clearly, he has a strong case for the Hall of Fame & I hope he makes it in. Truly deserving.
[I've had this glove since I was 7. I'm sorry for your loss. RIP Dale](https://i.imgur.com/CLRXTHY.jpg)
Your dad was a tremendous baseball player, absolutely HOF-worthy in my book!  Glad to hear he's a good person, too!  If he had been born 10 years later, (or Smoltz, Maddux, Glavine and Avery 10 years ealier), he would have been a lock.

Big up Ken Oberkfell, too!
This is the best thing I've seen on reddit for a while. Made me think of my dad. Thanks, man!
He was part of my baby blessing in 1980 and remained my favorite major league player his entire career.
How does the baseball hall of fame work that it‚Äôs his last chance?
Your dad is my dads hero! That‚Äôs so cool
My first baseball glove as a young boy was Dale Murphy.

I‚Äôll never forget that üëçüèª
I was a huge Murphy fan and I believe he should get in, but he is only #30 on list of players that should be in but aren't...so it's probably unlikely :( 

&#x200B;

[http://www.notinhalloffame.com/baseball](http://www.notinhalloffame.com/baseball)
I‚Äôm 51. Since I was 15 my baseball/softball glove has been a Dale Murphy Rawlings.
How is Dale Murphy not in the hall of fame? E
Wtf?
Your dad came to my elementary school often to eat lunch with you or one of your brothers
He was one of my favorite players growing up, and I‚Äôm connected to him on linked in! I hope to meet him one day!  

He should have got in today! I thought he was a lock! I had him over Simmons. Great catchers are rare though, I suppose. Still...2x mvp? What a tremendous career!!!
Whoa, cool to see this here. 

I had many favorite baseball players as a little kid, Eckersley, Boggs, Puckett, Abbott, etc. but Dale Murphy was the very first. I remember having a poster of him on my bedroom wall...
I spend thousands of hours watching your dad and the Braves play. Just always thought he was a good, good man. Cheers!
A 2 time MVP, 5 time gold Glover, and 4 time silver slugger. Many have wanted him in long before this comic. In his 6 year prime stretch he had 660 runs, 218 homeruns, and 630 RBIs in an era where offense was down across the board. People bring up his WAR, but this very same committee inducted Harold Baines this past year, who posted a 38 career WAR. Baines also peaked at 9th in MVP voting, whereas I‚Äôve already stated, Murphy WON 2 MVPs. Baines best season doesn‚Äôt compare to even 1 of those 6 years of Murphy‚Äôs prime. That is a crime. Every single last voter who put baines in, should be putting Murphy in. He‚Äôs a borderline top 5 player of the 80s.
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Dale Murphy was my baseball hero. There is no doubt that he should be in the HoF. But the one that means more to his fans is the HoF in their hearts. What a great baseball player and a more magnificent  role model.
Haha, what‚Äôs going on man. We went to high school together. I remember what a big deal it was when you guys moved into town and how awesome your dad was about signing balls or just having kids over at your house. Hope all is well with you man.
I have your dad‚Äôs signed jersey hanging in my man cave!
My first "Favorite player". No matter which sport I was playing, I wore #3 because of Dale Murphy.
Sorry about today's turnout, good luck in 2022!
Did he make it?
Sometimes the elites that vote for HOA admission are not the true fans of the game. Writers, and former players do not see the impact players truly had on their fan base. I‚Äôm a lifelong Phillies fans and I agree, Murphy should be in. Chase Utley and Ryan Howard are likely going to suffer the same fate. 

Your cartoon is very special, thanks for sharing.
So cool that you made this and I found it.  My grandfather and I would sit and watch Braves games all summer long.  He would cue me when Dale Murphy was coming up to bat.  And in those moments, repeated over and over, summer after summer, is how I learned about the sport of baseball.  Fond memories. 

Oh, and your dad definitely deserves a HOF plaque.
He should be in there. Rest assured we all recognize that. He hit 398 HRs for crying out loud.
Great post, tyson
Why did he draw himself as a gremlin?
Love the art.
Was unfortunately never around to watch him play, but I had the pleasure of interacting with him at the 2018 Braves Alumni weekend - great, down-to-earth guy. Hope he gets in today :)
Amazing. If I had a vote, you would absolutely have it.
He was my dad. He still is, but he used to be too
Dale Murphy absolutely deserves to be in the hall of fame.  There is no doubt he is one of the greatest to ever play.
Named my kid after your dad - Jamie Dale. Good luck!
Your old man is one of the best players of his era.  He was a freak and the hall would be better with hm in it.
He was/is also a great ambassador for the Church!
you also made it 3 years ago
This is very cool and wholesome! Wishing you and your dad best of luck today!
2 x MVP
7 x All Star

That alone should be enough.
Anyone else just check his stats and see he had an OPS+ of 1 in his last year? Only in 26 games but still Jesus, for comparison Chris Davis‚Äô at his lowest is a 44
If dale had played 15 years later he would have been on the juice and retired with 550 homers..he was great only from 82-87
Javy Baez avoids getting out to let Wilson Contreras score from 2nd base

[Pirates broadcast call of the "play"](https://streamable.com/oskwmc)
Javy signaling ‚Äúsafe‚Äù before realizing he is in the middle of a live play and starts sprinting is something out of Major League.
I‚Äôd like to point out there is two outs. Stepping on first base and not chasing Javy ends the inning and nothing the base runners do matters. Awful game sense from that first baseman.
what the fuck is this. I've never seen anything like it.


I JUST NOTICED THERE WERE TWO OUTS. WHAT THE FUCK
Let's see, we discussed this scenario, ohhh, 5 years ago...

No way this happens in the MLB
Hilarious. Just absolutely hilarious.

Weve peaked
Maybe relegation has a place in the MLB
Me trying to field in MLB The Show and forgetting the controls
Rizzo captured how we all feel watching this
YOU HAVE TWO OUTS WHAT ARE YOU DOING????
the FARTSLAM to end all FARTSLAMs
Even after the run scored, all he had to do was tag him! or step on first! it's not that hard!
Rizzo dying laughing in the dugout is my favorite part
[deleted]
I think I actually feel disgusted watching this play
lol what in tarnation
Pirates baseball!
Javier Baez is audacity given human shape.
Literally the best/stupidest baseball play I've ever seen in my life.
I‚Äôve never been more excited  for a jomboy breakdown
‚ÄúJavy Baez and the Pirates‚Äô terrible, horrible, no good, very bad baseball play: A breakdown‚Äù
I love that Javy took the time to watch the slide into home plate, signal "safe", and then run to first base. Probably the most entertaining player in baseball.
I need uninterrupted footage of the Cubs dugout from the time that play started to about 2-3 minutes afterwards, which is when I assume they might have finally stopped laughing.
this was fucking amazing and hilarious at the same time
[Current feelings on this season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZzlPGnKdU)
I don't think I've ever seen a first baseman forget there's a force at first before. You truly do see something new every day
This is it. This is the worst play in baseball history.
That first baseman needs to be released right now
If the mark of a player was the combined highlights of their best 20 plays, Javy Baez would be the greatest baseball player who ever lived
My favourite part has to be Rizzo just losing his mind in the dugout.
Absolutely perfect combination of an incredibly heads-up idea by Javy that still had like a 1% chance of working, combined with an incredibly dumb decision by Craig. Such an amazing baseball play.
And then proceeded to score on the following play. El Mago strikes again!
What a bone headed play lmao all the 1B had to do was step on first and avoid the whole thing
https://i.imgur.com/4AVuUuM.jpg 

Current mood
Remember if any *any* time Baez is force out *or tagged out* before Baez reaches base safely, then the inning ends with no runs scored

This required multiple physical and mental error to happen
Today I felt the need to update the original FARTSLAM post for the first time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/6tgsxa/introducing_tootblans_cousinfartslam/
Ok, so just for funsies, let's list all of the mistakes that happen here:

1. Throw to first base is off-line

2. First baseman follows Baez down the line instead of just stepping on first for the force

3. First baseman does not tag Baez

4. First baseman jogs/walks after Baez instead of running to apply the tag

5. First baseman watches Contreras round third and does nothing, also continues to just not run and instead jog after Baez

6. This one's debatable but the catcher is kinda standing in a weird place for the tag

7. Throw to the catcher by the first baseman is too slow

8. Throw to the catcher by the first baseman is too high (would Baez have been called for interfence if the throw hit him? IDK the rules.)

9. Baez and first baseman collide weirdly as Contreras slides in

10. Baez signals safe instead of then running to first right away

11. First baseman watches the tag play/umpire instead of doing... anything else

12. Pitcher watches the tag play/umpire instead of covering first

13. Catcher looks at umpire instead of prepping throw to first in case he's safe

14. Second baseman/nobody else covers first base which is now wide open

15. 2B drops the throw from the catcher as he covers the bag (Baez is gonna be safe at this point anyway 99%), allowing throw to go into right field

16. Right fielder (?) is covering up the line, which I guess is fine? But is not in line with the throw and neither is the CF, so when the throw trickles into right field nobody is there

17. After Baez is safe at first, 2B kinda just walks off?

18. Shortstop fails to catch the throw at second from the outfield/the throw is kinda shitty. Not sure who's fault it is so grouping it as one.

There's also a chance that 1B forgot how many outs there were, so maybe count that idk. 

So, who is innocent here? Definitely the left fielder. Debatably the RF/CF and catcher. All in all, absolutely wonderful.
It's unbelievable that Baez does crazy shit like this on the bases still and gets away with it. The fielders literally just can't think when he creates chaos like this.

Stunning Heroism Allows Runner To Score Like A Madman
El Mago baby!!!!
Javy being Javy
Welp, this one's gonna be at the top of /r/baseball for the rest of the day.
???????
Can someone please link to the pirates broadcast call of this? I‚Äôm begging you.
Okay I have a rules question.

Let's throw out stepping on first base for a second because clearly someone had placed an invisible forcefield over it preventing the Pirates from being able to touch it, smart play by the first baseman to notice that.

If the first basemen had not thrown to home and tagged Baez even after the runner from third scored (because Baez had run out of room), does the run still count? Two outs mean that if Baez is out without touching a bag it doesn't matter when the runner scores or how the out was made, correct?
Hi /r/baseball, I'm here from /r/all and this is the most hilarious thing I've ever see happen in baseball.

Thank you for your time.
Did the first baseman forget the rules of baseball?
OP how the fuck can you fuck up the title so much and not include *on a groundout and running from the batter's box to first base*
It honestly feels like the first baseman's instincts took over when Javy ran backwards. He went into run down mode, even though it made ZERO sense for him to. Best part is Javy calling Willson safe before running to first.
This is one of my favorite plays I've ever seen. So glad I decided to put this on in the background during work today.
So... did the 1st baseman forget that he could step on the base for the out?
I love when Javy was like oh shit I still gotta run and just takes off
[deleted]
this is why I love baseball. games have been played for over 150 years and this might be the first time ever this happened.
No exaggeration: worst defensive play in baseball history.
I just can't stop watching this. I've been watching baseball for a long time, and this is probably my new #1 favorite play of all time. For this to work, the amount of things that had to go right/wrong all occurred, despite the fact that the chain could have been broken half a dozen times with only the slightest amount of baseball IQ.

No one would ever believe that any major league player would make this many incorrect decisions in one play.

First, the throw needs to pull the 1st baseman off the bag so he never touches it, then the batter stops trying to get to 1st which is insane on what is usually a forceout, then the 1st baseman needs to forget that he doesn't need to tag the runner, just go touch first, but chases the runner anyway, then chase him so nonchalantly that you never get within reach of him, jog him all the way back home, then stop trying to tag him even though he's the only thing that matters and throw it home to try and get the runner at home for no reason since its irrelevant as long as the batter is eventually called out, allow the run to score, then no one covers first allowing the runner to reach safely.

It's insane and I love it so much.
This is less avoiding a tag and more Will Craig forgetting that tagging the base exists.

Feelsbad OP beat me by like 20 seconds with this terrible title that's being trashed in the comments lol.

[Here's the full play with the birds eye view at the end if anyone makes it this far down](https://streamable.com/tkm15d)
Boys I think this is the worst MLB play that has ever, or will ever happen.
*Willson, I was still excited from the play to spellcheck
update the cubs have officially broken the pirates first baseman
This the dumbest, most ridiculous baseball blunder I have ever seen.

There was two outs. Why didn't he step on the bag? I'm actually at a loss for words.
It's incredibly hard.

https://youtu.be/gzDYgRc6eic
We need to appreciate that this isn‚Äôt just the first baseman, the entire team is responsible for this!  

Literally anyone could have gone to first base and just waited there for a throw from the first baseman or catcher for the force out!
My favorite part of this is that Javy stops to celebrate after Contreras scores before running back to first.
Javy's power is that he makes all the players on the other team forget how to play baseball. It's insane, Baez honestly has the biggest baseball IQ I've ever seen
Uhhh... why didn‚Äôt the first basemen just step on the bag? It‚Äôs 2 Outs.
Javy has to be one of the best if not the best baserunners of this century. These are the types of plays and stories you only hear about happening by guys like Ty Cobb.
I cannot fathom what Craig was thinking. Did he forget how many outs there were? Even the throw to home was a lob with no urgency.
This is awesome! Probably one of the crazier plays I‚Äôve seen! I love it!
Ok I really love the quick "safe" call that Baez made before realizing "dammit I need to run!".
Baez's 19 second sprint time to first base has to be an MLB record for someone who ended up safe at first, doesn't it?
7.5k votes off the top post in r/baseball history after 22 hours... that‚Äôs special.
The Cubs announcer chuckling and saying "this is good" when Baez is five feet from home really sells for me. Just a beauty of a play.
Heads up baseball. Idk what that first baseman was doing. Just take the force
The Pirates should just forfeit after that as a matter of principle
Baseball has peaked beyond belief imo.
Poor Don Kelly was on the Pirates broadcast talking up his boys while this catastrophe happened. Holy shit lol
Why didn't he just step on first base lmao
I recently had abdominal surgery and laughing makes the area hurt a lot.

So I relate a lot with Pirates fans because I feel a ton of pain right now.
This is probably the dumbest thing I have ever seen at a baseball game. Dumber than Manny cutting off Damon‚Äôs throw. That whole team fundamentally forgot how to play baseball, especially the first basemen.
#WAIT, THERE WERE TWO OUTS??????!??!?!??
LMAO this has now reached the top or r/All. Congrats to the Pirates on their historic achievement.
This play now has more upvotes on this sub than  the Cubs breaking their 108-year drought lmao

*As you read this, please keep in mind that at best I'm a casual baseball fan. Hockey has always been my sport, but the emotions filling me up inspired this account of a small Englishwoman and her beloved Cubs. (Cross-posted from the /r/askreddit thread)*

My grandmother moved from a tiny village in England to a small town in Canada in the late 1940s, by way of a cross-continental bus trip starting in New York City. In that small fishing town where most of her children still live, she fell in love with and married my grandfather, a doctor from Ireland. Somewhere along the line, despite living in a country obsessed with the sport of hockey, she became enamoured with baseball. Nobody knows exactly why, but at some point she chose the Chicago Cubs as her team. Her love of her Cubbies never wavered, even though year after year she saw them fail to claim baseball's ultimate prize. 

She loved Ryne Sandberg - she thought he was cute. Harry Caray was naturally her favourite commentator. My fondest memories as a child are of watching the Cubbies with my grandma in the basement of her house. If the Cubbies were winning, she would rib my granddad, a Cardinals fan. If the Cubbies were losing, she would lose all of her proper English manners and scream and curse at the TV like any of the most passionate Canadian sports fans you can meet. 

One of the most exciting times of my life was the home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Of course, it seemed inevitable in our family that the two sluggers chasing baseball's most prestigious record should represent the favourite teams of my grandmother and grandfather, respectively. When Sosa lost out to McGwire, my grandma was beside herself. Once again, a Cubbie had fallen short.

I remember the infamous Steve Bartman incident. I remember how, prior to his snatching the ball out of Moises Alou's glove, Sammy Sosa launched a bomb out of Wrigley Field. My grandma stood up and cheered. When Bartman did what he did, all five-foot-nothing of my grandma launched out of her chair, wagging her finger at the TV as she screamed and cursed at the top of her lungs. Though it was never easy to be a Cubs fan, she never wavered in her support of baseball's perennial underdogs. She would joke often that she refused to die before her Cubbies won a World Series.

My grandfather was very ill when the Cardinals won in 2006, and in fact died not long after that series. I remember him refusing to go to bed before the end of the final game, storming out of his bedroom in his underwear with my aunt in tow, bursting into the TV room with a huge smile on his face to see his team claim the championship. My grandma was naturally happy for her dying husband, but she still harboured some competitive resentment that *his* team got to win so much (going back to the 60s and 80s) before her beloved Cubbies.

After my grandfather died, my grandma lived alone in the large house where they raised their six children. She hated it. It was empty and quiet and undoubtedly lonely, probably the loneliest she'd ever felt. Even though we'd visit her often, her favourite days were those with Cubs games, because the whole family would gather to watch the team with her. 

Over the past five years or so, my grandma has had to suffer with terrible Alzheimer's and dementia. She's lived in a home for a long time, and we've all had to watch as she slowly lost her faculties. Now, on a good day she'll recognise her own children, but mostly she stares flatly into the distance. It crushes me to see the vibrant, sassy woman who helped raise me as my mother struggled with alcoholism reduced to a shell of her older self. It crushes me more to see what her current condition does to my father and his siblings. They wear the years of her illnesses on their faces in heavy lines and sunken expressions. Something we could always hold on to was Cubs games. We'd sit with her, holding her hand as she slept or stared at the floor, watching the Cubs on the big screen in the home. 

When the Cubs started getting it together these past couple of years, everybody in my family would share sidelong glances of optimism, never daring to say aloud what we all hoped: that they might finally win a World Series for grandma. This past week has been an emotional roller coaster. During Game 6, my brother and his family showed up with a Cubs cap for my grandma. He put it on her head, and she grabbed his hands. She was murmuring *something* to him, but nobody could understand her; her speech has long since left her. My brother's daughter, all of five years old, touched his arm and said, "Daddy, she's trying to thank you." My brother looked my grandma in the eyes and said, "You're welcome." She sighed deeply, let go of his hands, and fixed her sight on the game. 

Tonight, everybody in my family who still lives in the small fishing town my grandparents decided to call home was in my grandma's room, watching the Cubs game. Cousins living in different cities were Facetiming so we could all watch it as a family. We were getting text updates from aunties and uncles watching hundreds of miles away. What a game! One of the best baseball games I've ever seen: a game full of ups and downs, joy and despair, optimism and pessimism. My grandma was wearing her new Cubs hat, but she slept through the entire game until the 9th inning, at which point most of us joked that she would probably want to go back to sleep.

When the final out came in the bottom of the 10th, we cheered as loudly as we could at 10 o'clock in an old persons' home. We cracked open a bottle of champagne and my uncle took my grandma by the hands and told her that her Cubbies had won the World Series. We weren't sure if she understood what was going on, but she looked from my uncle to the screen and back again, and suddenly her old experienced eyes welled with tears and a huge grin spread across her face. She laid her head back in her wheelchair and relaxed. We snuck her some champagne - she's not allowed to drink but damn it, she deserves it - and all shared hugs as the celebrations carried on on the TV and around the room. 

As I finish this, there are over 8000 comments and I know it will likely get buried, but I wanted to share the experience of a dedicated, lifelong Cubs fan. I know my grandma isn't the only old-timer with tears in their eyes tonight. Sports can seem petty at times, or base or meaningless, but seeing the reaction of my grandma - seeing her lucidity and understanding that her Cubbies had finally done it after decades of failure - was a stark reminder of the beauty and power and poetry of sports, especially the sport of baseball. It's tied to so many wonderful memories I have of my family, and tonight the Chicago Cubs gave us one more. I won't forget it for as long as I live, and I know my grandma won't either.
I honestly cannot believe what the hell I just watched.

Screw the historians. Best MLB game ever. 
The last time the Cubs won the World Series, the other sports' champions were:

* NFL - did not exist
* NBA - did not exist
* NHL - did not exist
#3-1
No question: That was the single greatest baseball game of the modern era. Possibly ever.

[Here you go ](https://i.imgur.com/26qDnQ0.jpg) Indian fans come join us 
Fucking hell, I thought they would blow it. I really fucking did. Hell, in the back of my mind, I kinda never thought this day would come. The cubs aren't really my team, but they are my grandfathers', and some of the best memories I have of him are when I went to stay with him for a week, and we watched Cubs games every night. I knew the history, I kinda felt bad for them, I quietly pulled for them, but after Lou when the team went downhill I kinda thought that was the last change my grandpa would get to see his beloved cubbies win a championship. He wasn't getting any younger after all, and the franchise was so devoid of hope. But now they've fucking done it and I'm trying to do is hold back onion tears cause my grandfather just got to see his baseball team do something that I didn't think he'd ever get to see. Hell, how must he be feeing right now? he's in his eighties, what is it like to keep the flame burning for so long with so much false hope. What is it like to see all that frustration releases with one throw to first? 
It's been years since I last sat down to watch a cups game with my grandpa and had a game of catch with him. One of my grandmother's died this year, and my grandpa takes care of my memaw as she slips away from Alzheimer's. It all sort of puts it in perspective, grandparents don't last forever, but I'm so glad he made it to see this day. He can't stay up to the end of most Cubs games now, and I don't think he's been to one in many years, but Id like to think he managed to stay up for this one. This ain't even my team but now all I want to do is cry tears of joy for my gramps and all the other cubs fans out there who've waited so long for this, and then call my grandfather and talk baseball again. Fucking shit, Go Cubs, baseball is amazing.

Theo Epstein: THE MOST LEGENDARY SPORTS EXECUTIVE  OF ALL TIME
Holy shit Cubs. What a hell of a way to put an end to the most historic draught and curse in sports history. You couldn't have scripted that much drama in a championship game. This was easily the greatest World Series I've ever seen and maybe even the greatest ever. Congratulations!

A quick bit of advice for fans: enjoy yourselves tonight and enjoy the next few days and be safe. But I implore you, don't get so blackout drunk that you don't remember this. You're gonna wanna remember all of this: the game, the series, the parade. Everything. It took me years to come down from the Phils winning it all in 2008. Enjoy it.

The Indians haven't won a World Series since 1948. 

2016-1948=68

The Indians played 15 games this postseason. 

68-15= 53

The game started on 11/2

11+2= 13

13+53= 66

The Indians have made the World Series 4 times since their last time winning it. 

66-4= 62

Up until game 5 of the World Series the Indians have only lost 2 postseason games. 

62/2= 31

31 breaks down to 3 and 1. 

The Indians blew a 3-1 lead.

My 94 year old Grandpa was moved into my parents house this week. During the 5th inning my Dad conference called my brother and I to let us know my Grandpa wasn't breathing get well and could pass at any moment. 

We sat and told him we loved him together on the phone, how proud we were of him, it was okay to go, and that the cubbies were winning the world series. He wasn't very responsive, but I can't imagine what it was like for him to hear at 94 from his boys that the cubbies were winning the world series. 

Thankfully, he made it another night. I feared the rain delay could press for time with his condition. 

But 94 years later, my blind Grandpa, purple heart receiver, decorated marine and widower to my Grandma last year got to hear the Cubs won the world series on what could be one of his final nights. 

This was such a special moment on the phone for all of us as we took a step away from the game. 

Go Chicago Go! Love this city.

**THE CLEVELAND INDIANS NOW HAVE THE LONGEST WORLD SERIES DROUGHT IN BASEBALL HISTORY**

Thanks Fox for showing a sad girl and not the 3-2, two out, bottom of the tenth, game 7 of the world fucking series pitch
I mean this honestly, with no bias, and being entirely objective: this was one of the best games in the history of the game.

Cleveland: your guys were absolute beasts; they were the best of the best. They fought hard, they went as far as they could. For that you can't be upset with them; they kicked ass and gave everyone either a trouncing or a run for their money.

We Cubs fans shared an unfortunate unity with you guys and I think it's cruel and unusual that it came to this. In fact, this was a nightmare match-up that I dreaded since the post season started. Alas, we know the outcome. But, I come here to say one thing to you guys: don't ever give up. You have to look no further than what just happened. Cleveland fans, from the bottom of my heart, I promise you "It's Gonna' Happen".
Can we say 2016 is and will go down as the most historic year ever?

How can you not be romantic about baseball?
Can't be disappointed if you're Cleveland

Loss or not, they fought hard.

Every Indians fan should be proud.

Very few teams make it this far.

Even though they didn't win, they

Luminated the hearts of 

America. It is about the attempt

Not the end result.

Don't be sad that it's over,

But smile that it happened.

Losses are meant to be built upon.

Earily, often losses make us stronger.

When the going gets tough,

A champion gets tougher.

The Astros have still never won a World Series!!!!!
Congrats Tampa!
I haven't followed baseball closely since the 94 strike. Subbed to /r/baseball earlier this year when the Dads told the unwritten rules where to stick it. But I know enough to be absolutely livid at the pass that the Astros got for what should have been a career-ending episode for many in that organization. Fuck the Astros.
No hate to Stros fans but FUCK this piece of shit team and their piece of shit players! Shouldn‚Äôt have been postseason elligible anyways.

Bravo Rays!
MAKE THIS THE MOST UPVOTED POST IN SUB HISTORY
Rays manager: We can‚Äôt let these cheating fucks beat us.

#FUCK THE ASTROS
Can't wait until fans are back in the stands to boo them in person.
Credit where credit is due... Astros fought hard all season thru criticism - and with a target on their back got deeper into the postseason than many thought they would... nah jk Fuck them all
I dont even watch baseball. FUCK THE ASTROS
FUCK THE ASTROS
AMERICA HAS WON TONIGHT

Guys do you know what this means? THIS MEANS WE'RE NOT IN THE WORST TIMELINE!!!
will this be the most gifted post in r/baseball history?
I don‚Äôt watch baseball and even I am overjoyed right now.
FUCK THE ASTROS!!!!!!!!
LOCAL SUBREDDIT IN GOOD MOOD
BEAUUUUUTIFUL!! FUCK THE ASTROS!!!
Eat shit cheaters.
Good. Coming back from a 3-0 series deficit is OUR thing. And the Astros can‚Äôt have it.
Everyone likes this
HIT YOUR TRASH CAN THREE TIMES THEN ONCE MORE IF YOURE HAPPY
One of the biggest disappointments of 2020 is the Astros did not have to face opposing team fans. They got off easy no doubt.
What are we gonna say now? Cheating ass bitches
I haven‚Äôt commented on this sub all year but here we fucking go!!! Suck my dick you cheating whore!
As a Dodger fan, I got more joy from the Astros losing than the dodgers winning today
This is already the #28 all time post in this sub come on people push it to the top
Cry cheaters cry
It‚Äôs really scary how 29 fanbases hate and I mean HATE one team. But I love it. Keep it going
**LETS FUCKING GOOOOO**
The fact that they made it as far as they did without cheating and without Verlander or Cole this year really makes me hate the motherfuckers more. They were more than capable of winning gold playing fair and square. When the 2017 Astro batting rotation are old men it will be the one skeleton in their closet they won't be able to clear out with a good conscious on their deathbeds.
Fuck the Astros
THE [CHEATING] HOUSTON ASTROS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM WORLD SERIES CONTENTION! THEY HAVE BEEN SENT... TO THE SHADOW REALM.
DISASTROS
HOES GLAD
Hello, if you are visiting from /r/all, I would like to introduce you to Randy Arozarena.

He is our lord and savior and now that you know of him, you too, are blessed.
FUCK THE ASTROS
GET ABSOLUTELY FUCKED ASTROS!
It‚Äôs a party in here
Couldn't have happened to a nicer group of dirty cheating shitheads
Isn't this that team where last time I visited from r/all you guys taught me they were trash cheaters?

If so then 

#YO, FUCK THE ASTROS
THIS IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A 29 TEAM WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP WE'RE GONNA GET
By far the best thing that's happened in 2020!!!!
r/baseball breathes a collective sigh of relief.
LOCAL HOES EXTREMELY GLAD

FUCK THE ASTROS
FTA
Yes! Something redeeming from the day
The whole baseball community won tonight. Even if the Dodgers don't get there ill be pissed but it'll sting less that it's not the Houston baseball team.
This is awesome

This reads like they died.
Damn that‚Äôs pretty sad, I remember the last practice of 2020. All of the seniors were so down. Even our big tough guy was sobbing. Tough times
Is this school logo ripped from The Pirate Bay? And, should they be upset?
RIP Wyatt Caldwell, Brock Cordrey, Anthony Coffee, Colby Haines, David Kennicott, Reece Oney, Alex Pergram, and Spencer Strunk. Gone but not forgotten.
Speaking as a former dumb high school
boy, this plaque is a challenge to dumb high school boys to go dig it up.

But a cool idea by the coach.
I graduated high school during the pandemic. No graduation or really any final goodbye kinda hurt. I didn‚Äôt care too much at the time, but now I wish I got those memories. At the very least, I had a more unique senior year than most people had or ever will have
It's Too Bad That Coach Aylor Couldn't Ask The English Department To Proofread It.
That's Ryle HS in Union KY, it looks like. Really neat, I grew up only a few miles from there (although I went to another high school).
I'm getting serious Super Famicom vibes from some of these kids' names.
My old high school started an annual tradition last year due to the pandemic. Since the kids couldn‚Äôt play, they invited any of the guys that hold school records or were all-state back to play the high-schoolers. It was super fun.

All these guys from like 19-40 playing high schoolers. A lot of the guys were having to hold infants in the dugout and stuff. The high-schoolers wound up winning 16-14. All the old guys could still hit high-school pitching, but only the younger guys could still throw at all, which was kinda weird to me. They just had the second one, but I couldn‚Äôt go because of school. It was pretty similar from what I hear, though. Just a good time playing baseball and getting around folks you don‚Äôt get to see too often.
Will they also be part of every blown strike call?
Great baseball names.
This reads like they all died
My high school had 3 seniors that went on to play college ball and they missed thier senior season due to the pandemic I wish I had a season with them I could have learned a lot
Just a *little* bit dramatic, or is it just me?
sorry, this is weird
Some 10/10 baseball names on that plaque. Coffee & strunk league bound for sure
Other kids on the team that weren't seniors: fuck you
I'm sorry, this is not awesome. It's weird and reads like a eulogy.
How long before some punks come along and dig up home plate and steal the ball.  Why would they?  'cause they can and it's a shitty thing to do.
Where did the highschools that didn't cancel their season bury their dead?
Baseball fucking rules man
This isn't awesome, this is sad. The last game of high school is bittersweet. Some kids plan on going into their sport in college but for most it can be the last real game they ever play. Imagine spending that game unable to grab the attention of scouts. Your last chance to play with your buddies before you go off into the real world being you signing a ball and burying it because of things entirely out of your control.  


This will serve as a cold reminder that the lack of empathy stemming from people 5x their age robbed them of years of their youth. This is far from awesome.
I wish I knew my last game was my last game
It's shitty because not one of those kids would've gotten covid from playing baseball outside.
If you cancelled my last season and told me to sign a baseball I‚Äôd tell you to shove it up your ass lol
Cringe
I would have lost my mind if I couldn't play my senior year!!
These guys have the most baseball sounding names ever
Kinda rough for the graduating pitchers, don't you think?
What a great idea and gesture.  I feel soooo bad for all the high school seniors last year and this.  They missed out on so much.
I hope those kids didn't peak in high school.
Man.  I feel for this those kids.  High school baseball was the highlight of my youth in a lot of ways.  Kids work there whole life for that senior season.  I was a hell of a ball player but I wasn‚Äôt gonna make an impact in college and my career ended that  senior season.
While this is a nice gesture and maybe the best they can take from the situation, this could never replace a lost season. At least not for me. I would be beyond heartbroken.
I'm not sure if I would tell someone where it was buried.  Kids are gonna be kids.
This is my old high school! Can‚Äôt believe I randomly came across this.
How trite
Those are some quality names
We have absolutely fucked up for these kids. They deserved this and every other tradition and rite of passage that they had to miss because of our inability to govern ourselves.
That's a lot of good ballplayer names for one high school.
Sounds like a reasonable place.  Little league never shut down where I live because of all the Karens crying about it.
Those are the most baseball sounding names ever
Tony Coffee is a cool name.
They‚Äôd make a great law firm: Caldwell, Cordrey, Coffee, Haines, Kennicott, Oney, Pergram, and Strunk.
Non-participation trophy
This isn‚Äôt awesome. It‚Äôs unfortunate.
That pirate Bay logo tho...
What does the pirate bay have to do with this?
For fucks sake they're not war vets just seniors
This is the silliest nonsense. üòÇü§£
Only 8 players on the team?
This is honestly heartbreaking, yet so awesome.
[deleted]
Fuck the lockdowns. Play ball ‚ù§
That‚Äôs bullshit let the kids play.

I played both my sports seasons and everyone was fine we wore masks it wasn‚Äôt bad
That‚Äôs horribly fucking sad, those guys lost what they had worked towards for their whole lives for overly politicized virus that barely effects their demographic.
Whats a guy from LA doing in Kentucky?
This is kinda weird, but I get it. I would have been devastated missing my senior year of baseball.
dumb
I‚Äôm so glad I graduated in 2019. I couldn‚Äôt imagine missing my season, graduation, prom, and the summer between high school and college. Best time of my life so far
Union KY
Those are 100% baseball names
My God, you'd think they were dead. Dramatic much?
Absolutely fucking epic. Great coach right there
Plaque actually reads. Kids possible scholarships, futures, dreams changed because of something that had almost no effect on them except people cancelled everything for them. You f'ed them over and you gave them a plaque.
No it‚Äôs idiocy. Cancelling baseball was an idiot move.
Kids aren't dieing from covid.
Stupid they even had to cancel
They should have been able to play.
"Hey, healthy, athletic kid; you had zero chance of getting seriously ill from this virus, but we cheated you out of an athletic scholarship anyway. Here's a plaque."
Seems a bit drastic
God I remember our last practice.  We got closed down just 4 games into the season.  It was Wednesday.  Everybody was pumped for the game on Saturday.

Somebody got the news halfway through practice.  Immediately cancelled the rest of our practice and had a little ‚Äúsenior day‚Äù right there.  Wrapped it up with a hit game, seniors vs. underclassman.

It was our year too.  13 seniors.  7 of 9 starters.  League champs last season, got robbed of a spot in the division finals by a blown call at the plate in extras.  We wanted revenge.  We didn‚Äôt get it.

EDIT: team that ended up winning the division was a team we swept in league play.  They won because the team that beat us on the bad call had no pitching left.  We would have had our ace and plenty of relievers.

The bad call was a tied game, bottom of the eighth.  Bases loaded.  Suicide squeeze, not a great bunt, pitcher fielded and threw home.  Our guy was in easily, despite the force.  Everybody could see it.  Ump apparently didn‚Äôt.
"pandemic"
This is not cool. This is horse shit. The state took our kids life away for nothing
HEY THATS MY HIGHSCHOOL I PLAYED BASEBALL THERE...damn that was almost 7 years ago.. I feel old.
[removed]
I'm prepared for downvotes, but should their names have been posted here? I get that they graduated last year, so they'd all be adults now, but now there's a picture in a fairly large subreddit with their names and where they were born. Seems sketchy since I'm sure none of them knew you posted this.
[removed]
I don‚Äôt need any more awards. Please stop. Give the money to charity
This post is now an NFT. Who wants to buy it?
Is it though? They didn‚Äôt get to play a game and so a giant plaque got made.  Boo hoo.
[removed]
[deleted]
I love the idea and sentiment behind this, but the execution was a little lacking. Maybe it's just the wording. The first line in particular is very strange. Are we expecting this plaque to be up so long that people forget what Covid was? We don't need to start it with, "In 2020..." We then don't need to spend the next line explaining that the seniors didn't get to play, because the previous line explained that the season was canceled. Then, "Coach aylor invited them to sign.." is such an odd way to choose to explain that Coach Aylor and the seniors signed the ball. The fact that it was during renovation is also unneeded information. The line about being a part of every run scored is fantastic, though.

But if they had wanted to honor the seniors who missed their senior season of baseball, they should have honored them a little more by spending half an hour finding a better way to word this mess.

And yes, I am **very** fun at parties.
This is WAY better than those signs reminding parents this isn't an mlb game. Made me tear up...those poor kids missing their senior year must have been realy hard for them.
Such a waste for a virus with a 99.98% survival rating.
This is so stupid.
Oh they played their final game alright
I thought baseball needed 9 players?
So you couldn't come together to play,

But you could come together for this debacle.

Heres to that school for making that class's senior year miserable. I'm genuinely shocked the drop out rate didn't skyrocket across the board.
I didn't read the whole thing and thought the team was buried under there...
Why are there only 8?   That‚Äôs bothering me.
People who somehow think this is special or moving are dumb as shit. School sports should have never been cancelled and this is a dumbass reason to commemorate something.
melodrama much? FFS
The seniors did get to play their final game on that field. It‚Äôs just that they did so during 2019 as juniors.
I'd tell whoever canceled my season and came up with this harebrained idea to shove that ball up their ass.
Omg, they couldn't play one game in the midst of a global pandemic!  
A plaque isn't enough!
ALBERT PUJOLS Mr. 700

[Cardinals radio call](https://omny.fm/shows/cardinals-conversations/albert-pujols-hits-his-700th-career-home-run-vs-th)

[Radio call overlaid with Apple TV broadcast](https://twitter.com/vanhicklestein/status/1573520390689005568?s=46&t=jf5QaHebWwuAcGyQnzFUwg)
3,000+ hits, 2,000+ RBI, 700 HR. 

It‚Äôs a club of just 2.
Congratulations to Phil Bickford for entering the Hall of Fame.
What an amazing baseball story. NL adopts the DH. He comes back home as the DH for the Cards. Proceeds to mash #700
What a moment. Congrats to Albert Pujols. Truly a legend of the game.
Babe Ruth  
Hank Aaron  
Barry Bonds  
Albert Pujols
# HE GOT AWAY WITH IT
The Man has done it. Doubters be damned. Pujols has joined the 700 Club as it's 4th member.
21 home runs at 67 years old‚Ä¶ what an incredible final season for Mr. 700
Ladies and gentlemen it‚Äôs quite possible you just witnessed the last person to hit 700 homeruns for a very long time.

The next player to hit 700 probably isn‚Äôt even active currently and it‚Äôs very likely we will have to wait along time before we see a feat like this again. Let‚Äôs appreciate greatness before it‚Äôs gone.
Going from Heaney to Bickford was pretty much a guarantee that this was going to happen tonight. Congrats T√≠o.
I WAS HERE ü•π
The mad man did it
At the game. People are WILD. I love baseball
Is the fan that caught it still alive?
What is my plan? I break into Dodger‚Äôs Stadium at 10 PM. Do I go for the foul ball? No, I go for the home run. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, Mike Shildt catches me. He tells me to stop. It's his ball. He‚Äôs the Cardinal. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell him to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust him. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's Mike Trout Jr. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Mike to meet me by the Arch in St Louis. He‚Äôs been waiting for me all these years. He‚Äôs never drafted another All-Star. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the 700th Home Run ball.
I‚Äôm glad it happened in a full ballpark of people who love him
MFer who got that ball is already in witness protection
LETSS GOOOOOO
#**IM FUCKING CRYING BRO**
So I'm English and really understand nothing about baseball but I do have an interesting story.

Back in 2007 or so my now wife and I went on our first holiday together as a couple to the Dominican Republic.

Whilst there, we got talking to a nice middle aged American couple on a jungle safari tour and I explained all about English sport and she explained all about baseball, her team the Cardinals and her favourite player Albert Pujols.

At the end of the safari, she asked for our address as she wanted to send us something. I thought nothing would come of it but maybe 2 weeks after we got back in the UK I got a package.

Inside was a Pujols jersey that was (at the time) absolutely huge but was an extremely generous gift. I can't say it turned me into a MLB fan but I do fondly remember this little act of generosity from an absolute stranger.

To see that he is still playing and such a good player is definitely a surprise and makes the gift even more special.
Mama, there goes that man.
#GO CRAZY FOLKS, GO CRAZY
HE HAS DONE IT
500 vs righties 200 vs lefties

Stop the count
I can't believe he really did it lol
legend.
You just knew he was gonna do it
THE MAD MAN ACTUALLY DID IT, CONGRATS ALBERT
Somebody make sure to get the mlb video link in a comment here so this isn't lost to time when the streamable link goes down in a couple years.
There's was a redditor that did a long ass write up on why Pujols won't hit 700

Where you at????
THIS IS THE ONE
What a moment
This is a way better 700 club than the one that is normally on TV.
I'm so proud of Wayne "the Randazzler" Randazzo for getting to call it.
"The Machine" is truly a fitting name for this man. Take a bow Albert!
THANK YOU ALBERT ü´°ü´°ü´°
Gotta admit - Apple TV has pretty good angles and cameras. Good choice for 700, even though I wish more people could see it.
Back to back bombs for number 699 and 700, incredible man
Hello to the top of /r/all
One of the greatest hitters in MLB history. it shows just how dominant he was in St Louis that he still managed to hit 700 despite the lost decade in LA
On behalf of the Dominican delegation I'd like to present Heaney with honorary Citizenship.

for all the hate on the apple tv broadcast getting this moment, the play-by-play commentator really did a great job. he made his call, which was solid, and then said absolutely nothing for the next few minutes and let the moment breathe. really well done!
HE DID IT
First time I‚Äôve cried with a boner.
It's a crime this had to be on Apple TV... I'm sure the Cards had all their broadcast guys doing calls though
I SAW IT LIVE ON TV
Albert needs to put off retirement and play for 2 more years. Pass Bonds and then call it a career.
**EVERYONE GET IN HERE!**
I paused intercourse to watch this on tv
Daddy.
Wow a recent historical event that I‚Äôm happy to see happen
Greatest thing I‚Äôll ever see live. I‚Äôm in tears in the bleachers
About to be a lot of confused Europeans from /r/all wondering who Albert Poo-joelz is.
This is one of the greatest two month stretches I can ever remember for a player, it's one of those times where a cheesy movie plot just deposits itself onto the real world.
My dad was a die hard Cardinals fan and was a big Pujols fan. My dad passed last year but I would like to imagine that my dad is very happy right now.
It's Hispanic Heritage Month and Albert Pujols became the first Latino to hit 700 HR in the big leagues. You love to see it
How much cooler does this become if the Cards win the world series?
It has become clear that Albert has been lying about his age. There's no way he's older than 35.
God, I wish Vin could‚Äôve called it.
All these Pujols HR threads look the same
I don't know shit about baseball but this guy being all over r/all for months got me interested.

The power of a name.
I drove 6 hours to be there tonight with my dad, who has seen basically every historic moment at dodger stadium since 1960. It is also his birthday tonight. How can you not be romantic about baseball?
What I'm getting from this is if he hadn't signed with the Angels he'd probably be passing 800 by now.
Greatest baseball player I‚Äôve ever seen play a full career. Truly a privilege to watch him play.
Dodgers legend Albert Pujols
Holy shit I was refreshing the box score for this constantly!
More pepper sir
so glad he hit almost 10% of them against the Astros..
And the curtain call on the road.  Baseball is a beautiful game and I'm so glad the Dodgers fans truly appreciated what had happened.
I love how Dodgers fans are pumped to witness history
Awesomeness.

I just wish Mike Shannon was well enough to make it one more season on the radio. I always loved his home run calls.
But I can imagine it: "SWING! And there's a long drive into left field!. Get up, baby! Get up! Ah yeah! That's 700 for Albert Pujols!".
To the shock of everyone, the Apple TV broadcast nailed the call
They even made a pitching change lmao, congrats Albert and St. Louis!
This one for everyone that proclaimed Trout already had a better career than Pujols because he played center and had working feet
So glad he made it. Also disappointed our normal booth guys didn't get to make the call.
Absolute legend of the game.

20 HR seasons separated by 21 years, in his first and last season. Only Ted Williams has also done that.
Very well may be the last time we see 700 in this generation
Awesome to see LA cheer the heck outta that.
That smile as he‚Äôs rounding the bases!
If it wasn‚Äôt going to be in St. Louis, it‚Äôs pretty cool it came in Los Angeles!
I actually teared up during that. It was so beautiful.
LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GOOOO
Devil magic has reached its peak. I cannot believe we're here!
Ichiro‚Äôs consistency.

10 straight seasons of 200 hits, .300 AVG, gold glove. And 7 of those seasons were in his 30‚Äôs. Incredible how he can keep up that consistency year after year.
Ichiro is a legend. Glad I got to see him play in person before he retired.
Damn, that‚Äôs a crazy stat. What a beast.
That is just so insanely impressive
I see "Ichiro", I upvote. That's my policy
Unanimous HOFer
I saw ichiros first hit on opening day, safeco field first base line about 20!seats up. I remember there was large contingents of asian fans with tons of ichiro signs like groups of 20-40 all over the stadium
We. Don't. Deserve. Ichiro.
The fuk you got him in a marlins jersey?  

Seattle Mariners baby.
For anyone that has watched any significant amount of baseball that is a mind blowing stat
Can't wait for him to be on the ballot and the voters doing absolutely everything to poke holes in his game
your pro hitters favorite pro hitter
Nick Madrigal got to .300 for good in his 6th game. Since he's going to end up breaking Cobb's career .367, he won't dip below .300 henceforth. RemindMe! 20 years
And stat nerds try to tell me that he isn't one of the greatest hitters of all time.
I will never forget seeing his cannon arm in one of his early games vs the A's. 

https://youtu.be/WYAxk01E404

A joy to watch this guy play!
One of the most reliable hitters in the league, and still didn't even get halfway to DiMaggio's record (27 vs 56).

Just goes to show how ridiculous a streak of even 30 games is.
Ichiro is the hit king prove me wrong
I like looking at his spray chart. True legend. 

[https://twitter.com/darenw/status/922234635387592705](https://twitter.com/darenw/status/922234635387592705)
I was able to see him enter the 3k hit club in Denver, as a Rockies fan I hadn‚Äôt cheered that hard at Coors Field since 2007.
[deleted]
Which means he got a hit in his next at bat as well.
Where‚Äôs that guy who compared him to Dee Gordon?
Damn, the year one hitting legend retires (Gwynn), another joins the ranks.

Starting to think 2001 was the best year (not counting Steroids) for baseball?
Imagine if he started his career in America
This is as good an occasion as any to post [one of my favorite things that exists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNG2cRlHfaY)
If you haven't seen [SB Nation's 6 part documentary on the history of the Seattle Mariners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFQua1LlKNMg1IOqAn15RkUT), I highly, highly recommend it...

[Episode 5/6  -  The Age of Ichiro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFQua1LlKNMg1IOqAn15RkUT)  


[My favorite moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AI_FJWZPY&list=PLUXSZMIiUfFQua1LlKNMg1IOqAn15RkUT&index=5&t=37m5s&ab_channel=SecretBase) of the series..
I know absolutely nothing about baseball. What did he do ?
Ichiro
This seems like an odd measure of consistency. Maintaining a career .300 avg in the MLB is in itself a remarkable measure of consistency, absolutely.

However, I would assume, based on the typical bell curve of a player's career performance, that the overwhelming majority of career .300 hitters reach a .300 career average early on in their career and then do not drop below it.

And, it's notable that he reached that plateau as early as AB #10, but I would say thats an indicator that he was already at an advanced level when he first arrived in the MLB, not an indicator of his consistency.
Him and Tony Gwynn best pure hitters(with no cheating allegations) of my generation. Loved Ichiro!
Counterpoint:

Ichiro batted .268 over his last 9 seasons.

Ty Cobb batted .357 over his last 9 seasons.
So you‚Äôre saying he was a .222 hitter at one point.
I am mildly bothered by the fact that you chose to use a picture of Ichiro as a Marlin and not a Mariner
Growing up with Ken Griffey and Ichiro in WA was the best. Big Unit too

I remember driving over  the mountains just to see Ken Griffey play.

Arod too but we don't talk about him...
I really, really, really, REALLY miss watching this guy play.
So he got a hit on his 11th at bat as well
I lived in CO for a year and went to see the Rockies play the Mariners and in the bottom of the 1st 3 bros shouted in unison ‚ÄúICHIRO - YOU SUCK‚Äù  
I was like ‚ÄúWho the fuck hates ICHIRO‚Äù in my head.
Legend
What a fucking legend
Wow 10 whole at bats to get his average above .300 what a scrub. Couldn't even get a hit his first AB and go wire to wire smdh.
Can't wait to see what asshole decides not to vote him in the HOF on the 1st ballot
I would bet this guy has a legit shot at HOF.
I saw him throw a ball from right field to home plate ON A ROPE at Wrigley years ago. I was completely blown away with his arm strength. You had to see it. Absolutely incredible.
Absolutely HATE that he's not in a Seattle Mariners jersey.
HOFer EASYILY
I only got to see him live in a Yanks uniform once but it was great btw.

Yankees 11th - I Suzuki sacrificed to catcher, V Wells to third, F Cervelli to second, I Suzuki safe at second on throwing error by pitcher A Loup. F Cervelli and V Wells scored on throwing error by pitcher A Loup.

https://www.espn.com/mlb/game?gameId=330420114
ELI5?
I'll say it again and again, if Ichiro is not voted in unanimously, I'll burn Cooperstown to the ground.
I saw him give an interview during the off-season in Japan about 15 years ago. He was asked about his consistency and he responded, ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a pitch you can‚Äôt hit. Every pitch near the strike zone can be a hit. Once I realized that I knew there was no reason to strike out or not swing.‚Äù
Amazing. But man, the fact that this is a picture of him in a Marlins uni is not right lol
Is he retroactively seen as a worse player because of how much the single has been devalued in today's game?
If you know anything about baseball, you know how unlikely it is that a player can achieve this level of consistency. Think Hank Aaron levels of production. Both players were outliers.

&#x200B;

I got to see him play with the Yankees. I will remember that for the rest of my life.
I was at a Mariners game for Father‚Äôs Day with my dad when he hit his 1000th base hit, Ichiro was my favorite player of all time and getting too see something like that was such a cool experience.
And it seemed like he was halfway down the line by the time his drag bunt made contact
We need more Ichiros. Baseball and the world would be better off.
üêêüêê
Got to see him play twice irl. What a treat. Such an amazing, dedicated athlete. And a cool dude, too.
Legend
I will never think of Ichiro as playing for anyone other than the Mariners
can't wait for him to get voted into the hall of fame.
... I don't follow baseball with any real consistency and I have know idea how /r/baseball wound up on my feed. But I know who this guy is from hanging out with my grandparents in Seattle when I was a teenager. Holy moly, it's incredible that we're even still discussing him. I grew up in DC before the Nats came to town, and we were all real proud of Cal's... longevity up in Baltimore. But holy crap, move on over Mr. Ripkin.
Sad that he left Seattle. One of my favorites. Legend
When I was living in Japan my family got to see him and the Mariners play against the Yomiuri Giants. Whenever Ichiro went up to bat the flash photos from all around the stadium would go off making the stands twinkle with light.
In other words, Ichiro's career batting average was only ever below .300 for 9 at bats.
Shame he didnt come to MLB sooner!  Would have loved to see how many hits he would have gotten
Stud.
Is this good? I know nothing about baseball.
Being a Reds fan, I wish they would count the Japan stats. I‚Äôm tired of hearing about Rose. He‚Äôs a horrible person and might only be mentioned in the HOF after he‚Äôs dead.
Why is he in a Marlins jersey we all know he‚Äôs an M :(
Pretty sure thats murr from impractical jokers
Ichiro belongs in the Tony gwynn/ted williams/willie mays pantheon of all time greatest pure hitters
Pff that‚Äôs nothing. In minor leagues (for kids obviously) I consistently hit no balls. Every game. That‚Äôs consistency
He was really, really fucking good.
‚Äúwhat did you accomplish in your life dad?‚Äù
‚Äúafter my tenth at-bat my career batting average never dropped below .300‚Äù
‚Äúfucking legend‚Äù
He was also allergic to walking tho
This comment section is hell on Earth. You efficiency nerds already killed baseball, won't you just shut the fuck up already and let actual sports fans admire arguably the best ever at getting his fucking bat to hit the baseball in a spot where he can safely get on base? Jesus.
Joe Kelly making faces at Carlos Correa.

You know you fucked up when you got Giants fans on the dodgers side lmao
Man I wish Puig was still a Dodger just to see the drama that would unfold tonight.
His entire contract is worth it for this gif
Threw it right at him twice then struck him out outside the zone. Incredible.
Joe Kelly is someone everyone except the team that he plays for hates. Today, he plays for us all
You know a dude is a real one when every team he's played for claims him as their own, even with middling production. Joe Kelly is my fuckin' hero.
I feel dirty for feeling this way but I think I love this man now
the most beloved man in America tonight
#how can you not be romantic about baseball
That impersonation of Correa is spot on lol
Today I root for the Dodgers, FTA
Include this in the banner of /r/baseball, mods
Correa was obviously going to be the first to snap from the trolling. Dude's mentally weak.
This post has made so many astro fans unsub from r/baseball, lmaoo
Jomboy wya
Correa might actually be the worst. He is truly always crying
Imagine getting clowned on by a man that looks like he teaches 2nd grade science

$wag Kelley
Hahahah this is so good. Im cackling.
Astros fans saying Kelly was running from Correa is fucking funny you can tell they just started watching in 2017 have they never heard of the Joe Kelly Fight Club?
Fuck the astros
The fake yawn after Bregman was the best one.
This is the first post I've ever seen, where every single comment demands an upvote. Fuck the Astros.
Petition to rename the Cy Young Award the Joe Kelly Award
The only thing that could ever bring me and the dodgers together is fucking the Astros
How do I give Joe Kelly gold?
Astros fans saying Joe Kelly ran to the dugout to get away from Carlos Correa. He struck him out. The inning was over. I know you just started watching baseball in 2017, but that's how baseball works.
Losing respect of your peers is the best part of the Astro‚Äôs mockery. I hope for many more public displays or clear lip reading of players reminding them
JOE KELLY FOR PRESIDENT
Context for the unfamiliar: This past offseason, the 2017 Astros were revealed to have been cheating, using cameras and banging on trash cans to relay opposing pitch signals to their hitters. While the efficacy of the "banging scheme" (yes, that's what it's officially called, don't ask) is in question to a degree, many across baseball were and are still mad at the Astros. The Astros beat the Dodgers in the 2017 World Series, so there was some anticipation going into this series as to how the Dodgers might try to retaliate. Joe Kelly, the pitcher in this clip, threw two pitches near or behind Astro hitters' heads before striking out Correa to end the inning and making the faces you see above.
[deleted]
This game has lived up to the hype! Mods, Game 2 should have a Game Day Thread!
Dont remove this mods
What a psycho I love it
this is what it's all about.

If the Indians don't win this year I hope it's the Dodgers. Fuck the Asstros
Joe Kelly is my new Dad
I think I love Joe Kelly now.
Fuck the Dodgers (respectfully) but fuck the Astros. What a shit organization.
I never thought I‚Äôd say these words, but tonight I was rooting for the Dodgers.
I honestly think Crazy Joe was in control the entire fucking time.  Gave up no runs, got to throw at whoever he wanted all-inning, and got away with it to the point that no one can tell if he was really in control or not.  
I think we may have just witnessed one of the greatest pitched innings of baseball of all time.
He wasnt even on the Dodgers when the Astros cheated. Joe Kelly is purely America‚Äôs pitcher and playing for respect of the game
I love how this brings all of us together. If you go to the Astros subreddit they're all being little bitches in there about how they're the most hated team in baseball.
Joe Kelly is my spirit animal
[deleted]
Astros fans awfully quiet today
Suddenly a Joe Kelly fan
Fucking love it. Every game we need joe kelly. Fuck the cheating Astro scumbags
Joe Kelly for MVP
Fuck the Astros.
I'd say Correa is lucky Joe didn't throw his [change-up inside](https://imgur.com/gallery/A2OADwt). Still miss him in a Red Sox uniform.
Astro fans salt has reached catastrophic levels...
 oh and fuck Correa!
Tonight was Joe Kelly night. Honor it.
Brb buying myself a Kelly jersey.
How can I save this gif bc I need it lmao
I had to poke my head in at /r/Astros. The butthurt is delicious. Suck it cheaters!
Corona high represent
"talk shit get hit"
The benches cleared in the bottom of the sixth. The word ‚Äúcheater‚Äù was used often.
Joe Kelly is the type of guy that will let you take the first swing to knock him into unconscious psycho killer mode. If you can't kill him with the first swing, prepare for death.
Hot take: fuck the Astros
suddenly I love Joe Kelly
He fired up the LA fan base and clearly made the face millions of MLB fans around the country had. Trashtros are a joke
I'm still shocked that the Astros got away with cheating to win a world series. That is craazy. What happened to integrity of the game?
I had such high expectations given the title and Joe Kelly came through for me. He always does.
Every upvote on this post makes some asshole on r/astros cry
I love Joe Kelly now
Fuck the Astros
I'd post this a million times if I could.
Never thought my favorite player would be a relief pitcher. Yet, here we are.
The Astros may have escaped the boo‚Äôs but they haven‚Äôt escaped fastballs and schoolyard taunting.
I knew this was going to be a GIF probably best one of corona era
I feel like the Dodgers are feeling they're about as fed up with the Astros as the rest of the world is with 2020.
Well, Joe Kelley has a new fan lmao. Good for him, fuck the Astros
Angels fans support the Dodgers on this.  
I think Astro players are going to have lots of bruises this year.  They should be happy it's a short season.
I love Joe Kelly unconditionally
Baseball players are weird but Astros fans are delusional
I can‚Äôt help it.... this is actually funny & it made my night! ü§£ü§£ü§£ #teamjoe
I‚Äôm convinced if the Presidential was tonight, Joe Kelly would win by a landslide. LOVE THIS!
Fuck the Astros
Imagine if he earned a living as a lawyer. ‚ÄúThe prosecution rests‚Äù makes faces at defense lawyer.
HOW CAN  YOU NOT BE ROMANTIC ABOUT BASEBALL!!!!
Joe Kelly is a treasure.
Big Joe Kelly fan now
Brb ordering a Kelly jersey
Man, Ryan Braun was my hero growing up. When shit went down I defended him for sure. I made all the excuses. Definitely went through all the stages of grief. Now I love making fun of Braun for being a cheater. He‚Äôs our cheater.

I empathize with Astro fans who are still so clearly in the ‚Äúdenial‚Äù stage. One day they‚Äôll be able to joke about this, too. Hopefully. 

But yeah, don‚Äôt do the crime if you can‚Äôt do the time.
Haha Correa called Kelly a bitch. Pot meet kettle.
Honestly the funniest thing on the r/Astros post game thread, even more so than the righteous Fuck Kelly posts, is them being all in on Rusty Dusty, literally see In Dusty We Trust there lmao
This might be one of the best things I‚Äôve ever seen wow
Correa is the biggest bitch in the mlb
Lmao this dude
Fuuuuuck the Houston Cheaters
Holy fuck do I love Joe Kelly now? Lol
New favorite gif. Fuck the Astros.
I will always love baby giraffe boi
Man, fuck the Astros. 

Sincerely NL "Fuck the Dodgers" West.
My question is how are there still so many astros fans coming into these posts and commenting stupid shit?
As a Red Sox fan, lord I miss this man.
Hell yeah! Fuck the Astros
I wish to renew my Joe Kelly Fight Club membership.
Goddam Correa is such a lil bitch
I‚Äôm not a Joe Kelly fan but this is hilarious. The soap opera I never knew I wanted
need 2 Joe Kelly bobble heads with these 2 faces
Hahah
obviously sport should be about objective competition first and foremost, but I've got to say, every now and again when you find those players that know exactly how to properly be a character, it can be so satisfying

Joe Kelly is absolutely one of those guys
Astros are so trashy, that I‚Äôm actually cheering for the dodgers here. What the fuck, Astros? ya cheating fucks.
This was so satisfying to watch. I hope these shitheads have to go through this every game.
epic joe kelly moment
Fuck Carlos Correa!
i hate him so much, and yet, what is this i feel inside me now?
He had me with the faces... then his taunt won me completely over. 

He was right.  He goes from 0 to 100 quickly, but damn what a ride!
Man, I miss this motherfucker on the Sox.

Enjoy him Dodgers fans, enjoy him well.
Every time I think of Correa calling themselves 'aPeX pReDaToRs' this is the image I shall see.
JOE KELLY IS A GOD
Bill Hader is killing it in this new role
I'm surprised we had to wait this long into the season  to see our first beanball. Hopefully these were just the first of many to come. Fuck the Astros.
I fucking love Joe Kelly. Fuck the Astros.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gW9KyzFnLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gW9KyzFnLA)

This was my favorite moment during his time as a Cardinal.  After today, it's now my second favorite Joe Kelly moment.
Fuck the Astros. Hope they set records for plugs in a season even though they're only playing 60 games. ..
Correa "if I hit a homer I'd be running home aight?"

Everyone "if my grandma had wheels she would have been a bike..."
As a Yankees fan, I stand with Joe Kelly. 

Joe Kelly 2020
"Nice swing bitch"
I fucking hate Joe Kelly but goddamned I fucking love Joe Kelly.
Joe Kelly eats his steak well done.  And today, I‚Äôm okay with that.
Tonight was a proud night to be a Dodger fan.
I just got insta-banned from /r/Astros for commenting on how they defend cheaters. How soft can they be? I didn't realize it was this bad.
Drawing Mike Trout every day until the lockout is over. Day 89.

I don't know what i expected, but this exceeded it.
I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it further.
Not just the Trout, but the Ohtani, and the Pujols too!
I hate pieces of metal. They're coarse, and ruff, and irritating. And it gets everywhere.
So incredibly accurate it hurts.
I'll try a lockout - that's a good trick!
Not just the Second Basemen, but the Basewomen and Basechildren too!
"I am altering the season.  Pray I do not alter it any further."
I have seen a security hologram of Manfred‚Ä¶killing baseball.
Trout Count - Day 89     
Trout: 98‚¨ÜÔ∏è  
Shohei: 17‚¨ÜÔ∏è  
Manfred: 4‚¨ÜÔ∏è  
Pujols: 4‚¨ÜÔ∏è  
Trout Head: 1  
Mariner Moose: 1  
Kate Winslet: 1  
Grinch: 1  
Altuve: 1  
Wilson: 1  
Rendon: 1  
Scherzer: 1  
Dump Trucks: Balance to the force retained (Manfred and Pujols still tied)
Darth Manfred
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Bartolo the wise?
There are too many owners. What are we going to do?
Star Wars: The Manfredlorian
Hahaha I‚Äôm crying man. I fucking love you
UNLIMITEEEEEEED 

LOCKOUT 

(Shoots lightning out of his evil smile)
#"I *am* the MLB."
155 games? Impossible. Perhaps the  2022 season is incomplete?
Master Manfred! There are too many games! What are we going to to?
Pujols lying about his age again.
I see this everyday on r/all and I up vote this everyday. As an Aussie I have no fucking idea who or what a Mike Trout is but I love it.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Noooooooo Manfred, not the younglings!
I hate the circumstances that had led up to this being the best picture yet üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Omfg this is it. This has to be the peak. It's a masterpiece.
Lmfao this is perfect
*‚ÄùSo this is how Major League Baseball dies. With thunderous applause.‚Äù*
I was wrong. This one is my favorite.
Commissioner Manfred, there are too many of them, what are we going to do?
From my point of view, the players are evil!
Mastah Skywalkah what should we do?
I feel confident in saying that this image here is the single greatest piece of content the sub has ever seen
I would still like to request Mike Trout as Eren Yeager facing a giant colossal Manfred

Edit: or Mike Trout as ginyu and the rest of the ginyu force being angels players
I fucking love you dawg ‚ù§Ô∏è
Goddamnit, it‚Äôs perfect.
Now I need the invincible scene with Trout standing over Manfred pointing to his head saying ‚ÄúThink, Rob, Think!‚Äù
[deleted]
Not the younglings!
Manfred is the dark side confirmed.
~~Manfred~~ Manakin thinks that the infield dirt is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
I cackled so loud my wife yelled from upstairs
Manfred cancelled games. And not just Manfred, but womanfred and childrenfred too.
This is my favorite.

Who is Darth Sidious in this analogy?
Every time I get a free award, I‚Äôm just going to come back to this drawing and give it
Now that the light at the end has been extinguished, it‚Äôs gonna get dark in here.
This up there with Borat on Day 69. But while that one made me laugh, this one made me sad.

Edit: and would you look at that, it‚Äôs #1 on r/all.
One of the few joys that the lockout brings is knowing I get a new drawing every day
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
You were supposed to bring competitive balance to the sport, not leave April* in darkness!

*Optimistic
Broooo
66 game season confirmed.
He doesn‚Äôt miss
Hello there!
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Manfred The Greedy? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story MLB.com would tell you. It‚Äôs a corporate labor lawyer legend. Darth Manfred was a Dark Lord of MLB, so powerful and so greedy he could use his hatred of baseball to influence the fans to stop watching‚Ä¶ He had such a hatred of baseball that he could even keep some fans from caring. The dark side of ownership is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
Man. How amazing how the drawings looks like he‚Äôs just scribbling like a kid but you can tell who is who. That‚Äôs a high level of skill.
While I don‚Äôt give a shit about baseball and I‚Äôm not even part of this sub. I appreciate some how seeing these every day.
^*Bwooooom*
Master Manfred what are we going to do?
I hate MLB owners...they're rough and course, and they don't get anywhere in negotiations!
I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new season.
Honestly the best one yet, not close either
"Always two there are. No more. No less. A master and an apprentice."
- Yoda

So Manfred is only the apprentice ü§î
Best one yet and that‚Äôs hard to do
Manfred looks confused and constipated, it‚Äôs perfect.
Not just the Mikes. The Shoheis and the Alberts, too.
Damn, this one is dark!
I‚Äôm not a baseball guy but I fucking love seeing these show up on r/all lmao. Keep it up. Hoping for a longer lockout for more drawings üåù
Goddamnit DIFTS you‚Äôve done it again.
This thread made me giggle like a schoolgirl
May the force be with us all while we wait for these dark times of no baseball to be over
Just when you think he‚Äôs run out of ideas.. he‚Äôs returned. with more. bravo 11/10
Long time lurker here. Both me and my so think your drawing has improved tremendously! It‚Äôs amazing! Keep up the great work.
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Trout the wise?
He was not the chosen one.
Rocking a Louisville Saber
Anakin looks super old here man you sure this isn‚Äôt palpatine
I am the MLB
Definitely the best one yet.
NOT THE YOUNGLINGS!
This is beautiful
*I hate you!*
Oh shit this is a good one
Love it!
We should maybe take up a collection for drawing supplies for you since my money isn't going towards the MLB anytime soon.
This is the best one by far lmfao!!!!
Holy shit this one is so good!
My favorite one.
Somehow these continue to get better and better while taking a direction that no one expected
This is The Chosen One
This is indescribably amazing on every level of each dimension you can think of.  

Well

Fucking

Played
I‚Äôm dying haha
You won me over a week ago and I forgot to tell you.

Also I do art and I see a growth process even though it‚Äôs LOL.  Thanks for the chuckles.
This is the best one yet
Mother of god this is by far my favorite. Way to go OP!

Edited to add: not only absolute gold alone as a piece of artwork, but how it can inspire this amazing comment thread. I want to congratulate and thank everyone for their ability to mix baseball and Star Wars memes‚Äîtons of creativity on display. I‚Äôm grateful to be able to enjoy while there‚Äôs a lot of bleakness out there. Cheers fellas!
You missed an opportunity to turn that into a baseball bat.
Oh, you've been saving this one for a dark day.
Lol I bet some in r/prequelmemes would love this
This is one of the best ones yet
This is my favorite so far. Thank you for the joy in a shitty time.
I don‚Äôt watch baseball or know who this is but i really look forward to seeing this every day
Your illustrations are my only awareness of this individual‚Äòs existence or some kind of lockout happening in the sport of baseball right now. 

Keep spreading awareness man.
Man I don't even know who Mike trout is and I don't watch baseball but your drawings shoe up everyday on my reddit feed.

That's some dedication man, I respect it.
Man, I don't watch baseball or even know who this Mike Trout is but damn I love seeing these every day lol.
I don't have anything important to add, just want to comment so I can be a part of one of the greatest reddit posts ever.
OP, I have no idea who Mike Trout is or what the lockout means, but I look forward to your drawings every day lol
I don't care to watch baseball and I have no idea why there's a lockout, but I've really been enjoying these drawings. This is one of my favorites.
I just want to say if you read this, you are a gift and incredibly creative person. Great job in these dark times.
You outdid yourself with this one. It's just.... it's so perfect
I don't usually upvote these drawings despite seeing nearly everyone. 

But this one deserves my upvote and my award given the state of our sport.
You get better every day. You are an international treasure.
I still have no clue who Mike Trout is, but I've really been enjoying this series of art that keeps popping up on the front page!
I have no idea who Mike Trout is, how op is able to draw these everyday, or why this is the only series of posts from this sub that I see on the front page.

But I guess I hope the lockout ends for y‚Äôall soon
> Master Manfred, the owners are not letting us play! What are we going to do?
Well, at least we're getting more of these cartoons.
No
I don't like fat dongers. They're long and hard and they make all the fans happy. Not like golf swings. They're all soft and smooth
Your masterpiece
Lmfaooo this is my favorite one
This is where the fun begins!
Because of Obi Wan?
Have you heard of the tragedy of darth manfred the wise?
RUN MIKE RUN
At the very least these will still be around to make our days.

Thank you OP ‚ô•Ô∏è
Your best one!
Your finest work to date. Beautiful.
Best one yet üíÄ
This is so dope!
Well, SITH is an anagram of SHIT, a piece of which Rob Manfred is, so I think we are onto something here.
This is where the fun begins
lmao
I thought this was Belichick lmao
That‚Äôs not Pujols that‚Äôs Bob Wickman
I hope you got more ideas man cause looks like you‚Äôre gonna me making these for awhile :(
Beautiful.
Mike, Commissioner Manfred is evil!
Commander Stu. Execute order '22
Looks like Hannibal Lecter. Clarisse.
These entertain me way more than they should lol.
Not just the baseball players, but the softball players, and the tee-ball players too!
Simply brilliant. Screw them younglings...  LOL
Incredible work
Master Manfred, there are too many of them! What are we going to do?

*zzzzzzng*
God damn it fuck the owners but thank god I get more of these drawings everyday. May the fastball be with you
Maybe the owners just love these drawings so much they don't want it to end?
Hello there!
Lol
This is the chosen one.
Do you know the guy who draws Paul blart every day at r/Paulblartmallcop
I see this from time to time and think the comics are genuinely hilarious, but I'm scared to ask -- who is Mike Trout and what is this lockout?
The best yet
NGL, I first thought of Bill Bellichick here.
Best one yet
Best one yet
Looks like fuckin' Lahey.
Hang it in the Louvre
I have no idea who this is but I do enjoy your drawings
This is easily my favorite one my goodness
He killed Troutlings??
Good choice for today.
This is where the fun begins
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
This is my favorite so far
He don't miss
Favorite one yet!
Dark but funnier of it was a baseball bat
My husband has been surprised a few times because I know exactly what day of the lockout it is. I only know this because of the daily Trout drawings. I look forward to these lol
This one brings a tear to my eye
This is the highlight of the lockout lmaaoooo
This is my new favourite. Omg this broke me LMFAO
Damn, this is amazing
Definitely my favorite so far lol so good
I think this is my favorite on yet, A+
These keep getting better üòÇüòÇ
this is the funniest one yet
That's not the deal your looking for...
At this rate you might get carpal tunnel from the amount of drawings you‚Äôre gonna continue to do.
I feel sad for the guy but it's gotta be the best thing ever to do. Love this guy.
Draw Mike Trout fighting Mike Erhmantraut for battle of the trouts
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Oh no, this shit got dark. 

I love that you‚Äôre drawing these. I hate that you‚Äôre still drawing these.
Could he waste owners instead of younglings?
‚ÄúThe lockout is a path that some would consider, unnatural.‚Äù
Oooh this is my favorite
This one is my favorite so far
Can you draw Mike Hawk, too?
Jokes aside, I have no interest in baseball but I have absolutely loved all of these. You are a tank and make my day better.
These make my day
Dude. You bow to no one.
Manfred has executed order 162.
I just got this suddenly recommended in my Reddit feed, I am thoroughly confused
What lockout
Every time you think they can‚Äôt get any better, they do
Honestly I think your drawings are getting better. This one shows some real progression
Lmao. Is this the most upvoted one yet? I audibly chuckled on the plane w noise cancelling buds in so it might‚Äôve been loud.
This, this is a masterpiece. Clearly the artist understands both his subject and the emotion in the air.
This one is hilarious.
This is by far the best drawing yet
Best one yet! Manfred is really making the case for supporting the MLBPA and turn everyone against the owners - the entire sports world is turning against him, what will he do for an encore? invade Ukraine?
So this is how baseball dies, to incredible artwork.
It's been a long time since "Albert Pujols" and "youngling" have been associated with each other...
I've looked at these every day and never commented, just a silent enjoyer. But this is so good that I hat to say Bravo
I‚Äôve upvoted everyone I‚Äôve seen. But this one, this is fucking spectacular. Legend
I know nothing about baseball but I know what Mike Trout looks like more than the face of my mother now.
I know fuck all about baseball but these are gold.
Holy shit this is so good
You did the best thing ever with the drawing.
This is one of the best moments of my life. today
Your best one yet!
You fix my mood every single day  :D
Imagine a stadium of people all cheering you on, because that‚Äôs how many upvotes this one got today haha
I fucking love seeing new Mike Trout pics pop up on my TL they are literally warming my soul. Thank you OP needed this üòÇ
Best one yet.
Pain
r/prequelmemes
r/prequelmemes
These are so great. Thanks for keeping up creating them!
When Top Gun 2 comes out, can you do one with Trout as Maverick?
just woke up made my day a bit brighter. also your getting better, I see it. thanks for doing these.
This is my favorite one so far. beautiful.
I can't believe you've done this.

Love it.
Dude I‚Äôm living for these drawings. I think the artistry has really improved since day 1 and that‚Äôs so cool to see. Keep going dude! Lockout or not.
I have no idea who Mike Trout is and don't know what the lockout is and don't really follow baseball at all but seeing these pop up every day is immensely enjoyable.
I had just started to get into baseball over the past few years. I can tell you this lockout is a killer for me and many fans like me, which baseball is filled with at this point. Also not helping are these‚Ä¶ Just saying as someone who is (was) trying to appreciate MLB. Probably just unleashed a downvote party but if this subreddit cares about the game, you‚Äôd take it seriously. This lockout is terrible for the middle ground fan lime me. You need the middle ground fan.
Angles ceo vs Mike trouts career
I don't follow baseball, and I don't know who Mike Trout is, but I seriously admire your dedication.
Perfect
Best one yet
Request - Mike Trout fighting a shark but the shark is jesus
i think this is why i want the lockout to be over.
What's a lockout?
Who?
Who?
So this series has me curious: who is Mike Trout? Is he a baseball god or a living meme or just some random player OP chose?
I'm not a baseball fan, but every time I see these the progress you've made in your art amazes  me.   Reminds me of watching /u/Shitty_watercolour progress back in the day!
I don't follow baseball at all. Can't anyone translate what's going here into F1 terms? Who is Mike Trout and why is he locked out?
*slurp* KARMA *slurp*
I‚Äôm sorry if I get downvoted here and totally understand why you guys will, but what is the end-game here? Make Baseball even less popular than it already is?

As a young kid I grew up on Astros baseball and my dad was able to afford the tickets from me being 5 - 14 years old. I distinctly remember going to baseball games at least on a monthly basis. Do you know how many baseball games I watch now? Not much‚Ä¶I only watch if the Astros make the playoffs (and miss half the games). 

The game is boring and way too slow paced. I‚Äôve stopped caring years ago and my kids are definitely not going to care with lockouts like this happening. An entire generation is going to grow up not watching baseball.
Missed opportunity to have the lightsaber as a baseball bat.
No one cares
Everyone is worse and worse.  And that has two meanings.  You idiots are upvoting shitty material which makes yo u the worse in this situation by the way.  Had to explain it because there is absolutely no way you would have been smart enough to get it.  This shit is tired and dumb and had been.  All upvotes do is prove that voting for things doesn‚Äôt work.  This is garbage.
Officer Jim Lahey
I sure hope Trout can stay healthy otherwise no HOF. If Mike lifts heavy weights and that leads to injury I hope he stops, he does not need to be stronger just healthy.
I am mildly confused, not being a baseball fan, and am trying to wrap my head around this as an outsider...

The minimum salary for a player is over 570k$?  Over half a million dollars to hit a ball with a stick and run after it.  No one is being shot at, they are not staying up all night trying to manage the life support ofma dying kid, or guarding a family in a bomb shelter.  There are no landmines on the field.  Surgery is not being performed.  No one is carrying an injured man down a mountain.  You whack the ball with the stick and run; minimum wage is equivalent to 273$/hr.  You can afford gas.  2022 rent is not a problem.

If you lose three months of work, assuming that maps to a pay cut, you are down to a minimum wage of 427.5k$ per year or an equivalent pay of 205$/hr.  Your children are not going to be hungry.  You can actually buy a house in 2022.

How is this situation equivalent to being murdered as a child with a large burning sword?  Can someone explain how this image goes with this situation?
I wish I could block seeing these stupid drawings everyday
I am a lifelong fan of a small market team that under the current rules of baseball is unlikely to ever win, or even contend, for a World Series again. The top teams (Boston, LA, New York, others ) are able to pay one player more than my team can pay the entire starting nine. Unless this labor dispute levels the playing field for teams from all markets
And makes the sport competitive again, I could care less if MLB ever plays again.
You are part of the Players Association and a traitor.. Take him away!
Why is Pujols in the drawing? I thought he just killed ~~kids~~ younglings?
Dawww....dawwww...too real. It is so appropriate. ;\_;
Not the younglings!
Absolutely incredible.
This one had me cackling
Hands down, this is the best one yet. How I wish it would've never had to have been drawn though...
Finally came to Order 66
‚ÄúThe douche is strong with you. A terrible  commissioner you will become‚Äù
There is no way OP thought this was going to go on for as long as he did.  I bet drawing these is painful now
Hey, this isn't the Mike Trout version of Randy Marsh microwaving his testicles to get cancer!
Most importantly where‚Äôs Grogu???
"Mr Manfred, Can my treat just be a hug?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MLvZcd4Tt0&ab_channel=Dezebel
If I had an award it‚Äôd be yours. Except youglings should be manfred and the owners
Trout looks like Bobby from King of the Hill
The best yet
Too soon.
dude...
Still asking for Mike Ehrmantrout
They cant do that. someone lock them out, or something!
We will watch your career with great interest!
Have you ever heard the tragedy of darth pujols the wise?
Did¬†you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Selig The Wise? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story the MLBPA would tell you.
I'm not a baseball fan and I have no clue who he is, but I really love seeing these drawings of Mike Trout.
That's Jim Lahey. Or should I say Darth Liquor.
I would love to see the Twitter bots that are promoting the owners make an attempt here.
I thought that Manfred was that drunk bastard Jim Lahey for a minute there.
My favorite one yet, dude! 10/10
Who‚Äôs that??
Who is the guy in the hood supposed to be?
More MurderFred, please.
Lmao God bless you
Senator Manfred is left permanently disfigured after the attack
Strap on boys, it'll be a while
Too soon.
This is the best one yet. I love it.
Fantastic
RemindMe! 1 year
Wait, the mlb is in a lockout?
Found my new favorite. This is awesome!
Hello there!
Its half a season then
I am repeating my calls: this series is a reminder that this crisis is not over. Rather, it has futher divided the baseball fanbase, and the damage will take long to recover.

Instead: support college and high school teams, Little League and youth and amateur community ball and travel ball. Support the minors and independents (including both MLB partners and non-partners), which begins next month, the other leagues in Europe, and the MLBers in Mexico and East Asia. Don't forget to give your support to the national baseball federations.

We hope that we will endure till the end of this crisis. Thanks once more u/DidItForTheStory!

John
This is the best one easily. This is fantastic.
Best one yet!
So THIS is collective bargaining!!
Day 90 will be a whole new mission
As someone who had no idea who Trout is or what's going on, I have been thoroughly enjoying these pics.
I love when I see r/prequelmemes in the wild
Darth Manfred
This one is particularly gloomy. :(
not the younglings!
Shoulda been holding a bat imo, but this is brilliant!
Bruh üòÇ
Please send this to r/prequelmemes
Damn, this is savage.
This is epic, man!
This is getting me through the lockout!
r/prequelmemes
Can anyone tell me what the lockout is about? Once it is over I get to move into the MIL suite at the house and I'm hoping it happens soon! (Plus he can actually start working again)
Man this is a great one.
This platform doesn‚Äôt deserve this level of art
But Mr. Manfred they‚Äôre too many of them, what are we going to do?
This is the best one yet
I haven‚Äôt been following this until recently so sorry if im behind here, but could you do a Mike Trout Texas Chainsaw Massacre imagine plz?
Wtf.. my friend.. Mike Trout.. was shot in the head and died in the 90‚Äôs. His mom was a nurse and had to clean his brains off the kitchen floor. 
I went to his funeral. For fucks sakes. He was 22.
Damnit, Bobby
**I AM THE LOCKOUT**
The bubble of friends I have that know enough about baseball to know Mike Trout are not the same bubble that watched the prequel trilogy.
‚ÄúThis is where the fun begins‚Äù 

- Manfred, probably
Do simba next
That was some good peein'!!
"If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Manfred's leadership." -Queen Amidala
Owners: ‚ÄúYou were right about one thing, Manfred. The negotiations *were* short.‚Äù
The Saga continues...
This is the first Daily Trout to have multiple panels. How long until u/DidItForTheStory is doing Kentaro Miura style panels for the full length Daily Trout manga?
Love it
Took me a second but fughk yeah!
I love that you‚Äôre still drawing Pujols in an Angels uniform üòÇ
This was really funny!
I can't believe owners and the MLB would rather lock out than watch Mike Trout in his prime üòû
This is where the fun ends.
You were right, the negotiations were short
Yes
Haha this is one of my favorites
