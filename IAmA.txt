I am Barack Obama, President of the United States -- AMA
Hi, I’m Barack Obama, President of the United States. Ask me anything. I’ll be taking your questions for half an hour starting at about 4:30 ET.

Proof it's me: https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/240903767350968320

We're running early and will get started soon.

UPDATE: Hey everybody - this is barack. Just finished a great rally in Charlottesville, and am looking forward to your questions. At the top, I do want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with folks who are dealing with Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf, and to let them know that we are going to be coordinating with state and local officials to make sure that we give families everything they need to recover.

LAST UPDATE: I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to http://gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

Here is a collection of all the questions and answers:

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)
>I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?

Answer:
>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.

>What's the recipe for the White House's beer?

Answer:
>It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)
>What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?

Answer:
>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)
>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?

Answer:
>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)
>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?

Answer:
>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)
>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?

Answer:
>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.

>Who's your favourite Basketball player?

>Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)
>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?

Answer:
>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)
>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?

Answer:
>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)
>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?

Answer:
>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

How in the fuck was PresidentObama not already taken?
What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term? 
the title of this should have been obAMA
Mr. President, do you feel that there is a problem with the "revolving door" of congressmen and prominent lobbyists? For an example, I'd point to former Senator Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for the MPAA. Is there anything to be done about it?
What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?
Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?
[We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom](http://mashable.com/2012/08/29/republicans-internet-freedom/). Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?
The current US Patent system is hurting small businesses, in response the EFF has released [seven proposals for fixing the patents system](https://defendinnovation.org/). What plan does your administration have to address these issues?
Coming up: Tactful avoidance of marijuana questions and disappointment from /r/trees. 
What is the purpose of the embargo on cuba? will you consider lifting it? (Thanks for doing this AMA)
The moderators and admins have confirmed this thread; this is actually President Obama.

Edit: [and he's confirmed via twitter](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/240903767350968320)
It's been stated that your favorite television show is The Wire. How do you think the war on drugs has affected America, and would you work to end it?
My question is this: Why would you sign the NDAA when it included language that would allow the indefinite detention of Americans without due process. I understand that this was the de facto case for awhile. Now it's law. This passed by overwhelming bi-partisan support, despite being hated by most citizens. It feels like the government, including the Executive branch, no longer work for the citizens that elect them. (By the way, I fully supported your first campaign, but I'm now disillusioned and disappointed.)
What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?
[removed]
Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?

Edit: grammar
If you had the ability to automatically enact or repeal only one law without congressional approval, what would you choose and why?
I can confirm that this is indeed legit. 
Mr. President,
What are you doing about returning soldiers with PTSD, particularly those that have acquired various drug addictions.  I know there are a lot of VA facilities available, but they still have long waiting lists for the best inpatient programs.  I ask because of my brother, who did three tours in Iraq, was prescribed oxycodone for a wartime injury, and came back with a bad heroin addiction.  Please do more for these troops!  Thank you.
Sir, do you anticipate the SEC convicting anyone for the massive banking and securities fraud that caused the 2008 financial crisis?
Your administration has been very quiet regarding Americans' issues with the TSA and their invasive security procedures. Your administration even [pulled](http://www.infowars.com/white-house-pulls-down-tsa-petition/) a petition regarding making them answer a court order regarding the naked scanners.

Do you have any plans to reel in the over-reaching, rights-infringing bureaucracy the TSA has become?
Marijuana prohibition has resulted in the arrest of over 20 million Americans since 1965, countless lives ruined and hundreds of billions of tax dollars squandered and yet this policy has still failed to achieve its stated goals of lowering use rates, limiting the drug’s access, and creating safer communities.

Isn’t it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?
Let's skip the marijuana legalization question that'll show up at least 50 times on this page and get to a related issue: After promising that you wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis, how can you justify utilizing federal funds and agencies to shut down dispensaries and arrest people who are legitimately sick?
How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?
Since this is the house that kn0thing built, let me ask a tech entrepreneurial questions.

1. I just found out yesterday about the changes your administration has proposed for tax rates on C-Corps (dropping the rates to 28%).  Why isn't anybody talking about this?  I feel like this is something that you'd want to make sure to get across to folks in the entrepreneurial world!

2. Does the democratic party know how much distrust it's sown through the SOPA/PIPA efforts?  I'm a staunch liberal, and made sure to call my congress critters over this issue.  Despite the extents to which your administration has done on awesome tech issues, SOPA/PIPA hit a really sour note for folks like me.
President Obama - How can we help to increase the standard of debate in this country so that it's not simple soundbytes and broad generalizations of complicated problems?
Stop asking questions.

This AMA ended.... A Month Ago.

Also, it even says 
>I’ll be taking your questions for half an hour starting at about 4:30 ET.

What are you going to do in your second term to address the failed war on drugs?
Hey, I'm a Canadian and I've always wondered what you thought about the Canadian health care system compared to the US health care system!

Thanks for doing an AMA!
Mr President, are you concerned about the division the US has? Red and blue, christian and secular, pro-life and pro-choice... its become almost like a football rivalry where you want the other team to lose even if it is not in the benefit of anyone. 
What can be done to amend this?
Mr. President - What issues, if any, do you agree with Mitt Romney that are not commonly endorsed by the majority of the Democratic Party?
Isn’t it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?"
What do you have to say about the drug war? Do you think it's a problem that millions of Americans are in jail for non-violent crimes?
In what ways will you attempt to make university a more affordable path for students?
Are there any plans to reduce military spending throughout 2013/14 and put the money into other areas such as the space program or helping to overhaul the education and health care systems?
Mr. President, you do realize you are going to break the Internet, right?
Who's your favourite Basketball player?
Mr. President, when will the United States officially move to the [metric system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system)?
What's the recipe for the White House's beer?
The landing of Curiosity on Mars shows Americans still care deeply about our space exploration efforts. What are your plans for NASA if you get re-elected?
With all the patent lawsuits taking place recently, it has become painfully obvious that the system needs revision. Action or inaction on this issue can affect innovation for years to come. How does your administration plan on dealing with this issue during the next four years if you are re-elected?

Mr. President, can you stop the NHL Lockout? Please?

President Obama, why didn't you close Guantanamo Bay as you promised you would?
Mr. President, why did you insist on the continued imprisonment of Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye?  Is he being punished for revealing that it was a US Tomahawk missile that killed 14 women and 21 children in al Majala on Dec 17th 2009, not a Yemeni air strike as reported by the pentagon?

Mr. President--Thank you for doing this!

You're likely to get a lot of questions about policy, and those are important; but I'm interested in hearing a story. Can you tell us about visiting a favorite town or location, anywhere in the world, and why the experience stands out in your memory?

Why don't you tax the movie stars and celebrities and producers who make crap remakes and then earn millions a year for the rest of their lives? They are ones people should be angry at. The best they contribute to society is a short stress relief. Then they have the audacity to demand massive fines and law suits while they sit on millions because some one pirated one of their movies? That is a complete mutilation of intellectual property laws. Everyone knows that John Doe didn't create Avatar so why is he and other innocent bystanders getting hit so hard just because he watched it without paying $30 for it? 
Dear Mr. President

You responded to my little sister's letter once, thank-you for being an actively involved leader. It meant a lot to her. I am a first year medical student. I am worried about the debt I am taking on. I have read a lot about the healthcare bill and the student loan bill. I have also been hearing a great deal (from my professors and peers) about how America has the most expenditure on healthcare while being ranked rather low on our healthcare system. Is your bill the first step in a larger plan to remedy our failures in the system? I did not choose to become a doctor for money, but should I be worried that I will not have the opportunities that my father had once I get my MD, especially while the debt I took on is greater? Thank-you again for your time.

Sincerely,
American Boy from NY
I have an 11 year old and a 13 year old child. I currently pay more for them to go to private school for one year than I paid for my entire master's degree. 

What can you do to heal our very broken public school system (which I want to love)? What can I expect for them when they go to college in a few short years? 
Why are we still in Afghanistan?
What is being done to prevent future (and investigate past) tampering with election equipment?  There is some pretty damning evidence of vote tampering in 2004, most prominently in Ohio.  As a resident of Ohio in 2004, why should we even bother voting if our votes are filtered through Republican-owned data centers?

Edit:  [Recent front-page link on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yxb2q/flashback_last_year_it_was_revealed_that_the_ohio/)
Mr. President : are you going to reach out to the Libertarians on some level to garner some votes on a few issues like pulling out of the middle east?
Barack, I know you've received a lot of criticism for "Obamacare", and it may not be a perfect solution, but I think it's a step in the right direction. It has personally been a big help within my family.

I lost my big sister to cancer exactly 3 months ago. If it weren't for some of the laws you helped create, she would have left her husband millions of dollars in debt. Because of those laws, she was able to fight it with every possible treatment we could find without worrying about where we would get the money.

Thank you. 

I only wish she could tell you that herself, she was very grateful for the chances she was given. My whole family is grateful. 
Is there anything going to be done about the current state of student loans?

What has been your favorite moment of your presidency?  The saddest? 
Have you ever seen EpicMealTime on YouTube? If so, do you like it?
Wow! Regardless of what anyone thinks politically, you can't say that our leader is not in touch.  Very impressive, Mr. President!
1) Why are you taking money from Wall Street and then your Justice department pardons Goldman Sachs?

2) Why do you aid Israel (An apartheid country that lives on blood and money of Americans) ? Also explain how is Zionism not bigotry? (Actually any non-secular policy is bigotry)

3) Why are you having a kill list and killing innocent people to make more terrorists? 

4) Why are you expanding US military presence abroad where it is not our business? 

5) Why are you supporting NDAA and extending the patriot act? 

As a small business owner, my biggest issue in expanding and hiring more people is the necessary funds to do so. What can be done to encourage banks to lend more to small businesses in order to encourage growth. Thank You.

What is the plan for Gitmo Bay?
and for marijuana legislation? 
Why does your administration raid so many state-approved medical marijuana dispensaries?
Do you think it's justifiable to imprison or fine someone for a crime that doesn't involve violence against someone else? Has a family member or friend of yours ever been charged with a victim-less crime? Do you feel that was the most effective way to change their behavior?
Dr. Obama, several months ago you rode your big 'ol bus through New Vienna, Iowa and waved at people on the street. I believe you waved directly at me as well, during this very presidential visit.

President Obama: What is one belief or principle about government that you want to let the Reddit community know that separates you from your political candidate, Mitt Romney? 
Thank you for doing this AMA
Hi, big fan here.  I've got two quick questions:

Do you consider the War on Drugs to be a failure. Why or why not?

And second, what do you say to the families of the US Citizens you've ordered droned to death by executive fiat, and how does such an order comport with your understanding of constitutional law.
Hello, Mr. President!  Big fan. :-)  I'd like to know what you feel about what I think is a very under-talked-about issue...assisted suicide.  I'm 35 now, but when I'm older I don't want to suffer with some slow-moving cancer or other terrible, uncurable disease. It's a big fear and it's sad so many people have to die with so little dignity.

What's your position?
Mr. President, I am a resident of the District of Columbia.  It seems like voting rights for DC has been a ridiculously politicized issue, with Democrats generally in favor and Republicans generally opposed.  If you are re-elected President, what do you plan/hope to do to break through this stalemate and provide some basic level of elected representation to the 600,000 tax-paying citizens of the District?
The republicans have included 'Audit the Fed' in their platform. Something that I agree with. Do you agree with this or plan to look into the Fed in your second term?
President Obama. With everything that is going on around the world and our debt approaching 16 trillion dollars, don't you think it is time we stop the wars and close down at least half of our bases?
Is anyone else reading this in his voice?
What, if anything, can you do to block the voter suppression measures in swing states like Pennsylvania?
I know he's no longer answering, but I feel this question should be higher up. Why are you allowing suppression of third parties? Obviously, a third party taking votes from you isn't your favourite idea, but shouldn't America have more than two choices?
President Obama, I have two questions for you. While each are equally important to me, feel free to answer either one. I am a sixteen year old female planning on joining the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. If elected for a second term, what would you do to ensure that alternative energy is moving forward? I am asking this because after serving in the Navy, I would like to see a substantial growth in support and funding into the search for a cleaner and more efficient  energy source. Thank you in advance for taking the time and consideration to respond. 

Now for my second question. If faced with a sudden outbreak leading to the dead rising and attacking the living, what would you do? What is your zombie apocalypse plan? Once again thank you and I really hope that you get a chance to respond. Have a good day. :)

Even though I know this post is late, and will most likely get buried and might never read it, I want to simply thank you for the Deferred Action Process. You have brought hope to me and my family. I promise to do something good for our country as well as to give back to those who need it. 
You know? I never would of imagined that I'd ever have a chance to interact with the President of the United States. I am appalled by the actions of the government, those on the campaign trail, and the companies that make the rich and powerful take precedence over the poor and weak. I am ashamed of a government dominated by supposed "Christians" that's agenda has been sending off our friends, siblings, and other relatives off to fight for the interests of corporations. I am ashamed of the desperate need to expand the size of our miltary forces instead of working to diminish the size of the military. I am upset that being an economic hitman is supposedly what is good for me as a member of the LGBT community and yet homelessness, poverty, and injustice strikes many LGBT people and threatens to destroy them. I am saddened by the fact that many people do not have homes and instead we have private prisons that uses inmates for cheap labor.

You know Mr. President? I was wanting to post something incredibly angry, but all I really want to know is what are you going to do to fix it?

President Obama, if another country was treating a captured U.S. soldier the way that PFC Bradley Manning was treated in the brig at Quantico, VA (conditions deemed "cruel, inhuman and degrading" by UN Chief Rapporteur on Torture Juan Mendez), would you deem that acceptable and [appropriate](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/11/obama-bradley-manning-tre_n_834669.html)?

Are you happy?
I'm a 25% owner in a small family business (125 emps). How do I convince my 3  partners that the local and sate chambers, business news about how much more Obamacare and Fed regs will cost us is BS? Some great infographics from your campaign team would be really helpful! 
Protect Net Neutrality. Save the Internet.

Here is a White House petition to [save Net Neutrality.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality)

Edit: Please share this link. We can achieve more than 100,000 signatures and show the White House how we care about Net Neutrality. 

Edit: We did it Reddit! Over 132,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. Don't get complacent, though. There is much we need to do to make sure Net Neutrality is saved. 
This is nuckingfuts... I entered in two different zips and both my representatives were NOT accepting calls or voice mails. 

I called the FCC directly from their website and they said they were "longer than average wait times". Then they gave an alternate route to make a complaint about the long wait. Then proceed to read long URL transcript... over the phone... not as a link. I tried to connect with a department NOT RELATED TO THE FCC CHANGES and a machine said they were not accepting calls and then hung up on me. 

I mean... why would they make it so hard for my voice to be heard.  
Companies like Comcast and At&t are just wringing their hands in excitement thinking of all the possible charges they can hit us for. Call/email your reps today guys and gals! Don't let the piss in our faces and say it's a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
*** PLEASE CALL GUYS! ***

Every call helps, we can’t let the FCC take away our protection to a fair and open internet. This WILL affect YOU in major ways!

Verizon user?
Boom!

*Using your G-mail account is now a 3$ monthly surcharge since you aren’t using a Verizon email service.

*Google itself will be throttled because In a buyout this year they now own Yahoo! And why would they want you using a competitors service when you can use their own service?

Boom!

*Netflix is now a 5$ a month surcharge since Comcast doesn’t own Netflix and would rather you use Hulu since they own a 30% share of through NBC-universal.

*Buying any movie tickets not on fandango is blocked by Comcast since they own fandango.

And this is why we need to fight for an open, free internet.

Rules I like to follow :

• Always use a VPN (/r/Nologsvpn). This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling.

• Keep your social media usage as little as possible.

• Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. Especially if you give away identifying information or post in local subreddits.

• Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.

If anyone has any extras please share! :)

Glad this is everywhere *here,* but is it on Facebook and YouTube too? That's where the dumbos that got us in this mess in the first place will see it.
What if you aren't in the US?

Edit: What can I do if I live outside of the US?
What is happening to the US? As a non-american, Everyday in the the news there is some issue that shows the US in bad light. The Hollywood sex scandals, Net neutrality, regarding elephant trophy hunting, the climate pact,etc. It's like the govt is taking a step backwards, not forward. So sad to see this. 
Just a reminder not to just upvote shit on Reddit and actually call these cantankerous slimey fucks. 

Ajit Pai is *literally* a corporate crony that was Verizon's go-to lawyer when they wanted to fuck a bunch if customers over. He's a degenerate and now he runs the FCC. 

#DONT LET THESE GREEDY BAGS OF SHIT GET AWAY WITH THIS. IF ANY OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS VOTES IN FAVOR OF ABOLISHING NET NEUTRALITY, VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE#

IAmA citizen of America who is always screwed over by my representatives because I don't have millions of dollars to bribe them into doing what I want them to do. AMA 

This net neutrality "vote" is a just a huge middle finger to every American in this country. I hope it is shot down, but I will not hold my breath. I really feel like once again, money and corruption will win the day and the American people will have their faces spit in....again. 

It really would be a nice change of pace if our elected representatives really represented us instead of just paying lip service. I don't care what anybody says about this being because Trump was elected, this is what they have collectively wanted for a long time now, and either way, they were going to wear us down until there was no fight left against it.

Maybe when people have to start paying for Facebook, or they can't stream their Netflix or whatever else it will be worth their time and effort to do something. The apathy that lets these kinds of things happen is appalling.   
well here in Arabic countries ! ALL calling application are blocked , many websites are blocked too . So I already know the feeling :)
And they call the US government a democratic government, glad I'm from a country not controlled by jackasses and clowns, ffs, America doesn't have freedom, you have to pay for it...
If you haven't already, text "resist" to 50409. It's incredibly easy. All you have to do is give the bot your name and address and it will contact your congressman / senator etc. I've been sharing this with everyone I know and it seems to be the most well received because it is easy even for the tech illiterate. It helps to add a personal message as to WHY you oppose the repeal (ex. 'I'm a small business owner and this repeal greatly concerns me because it would limit the customers who will be able to access my content and therefore threaten my livelihood.') Best of luck to you all. (cross posted on multiple threads.) 
I'm currently abroad with the Peace Corps. What can I do while away from home?
Serious question: Should I, as someone who does not live in the USA, care about this?

These are the Twitter's of the 3 people set to vote against net neutrality during the official FCC vore, not sure why I haven't seen more of this compared to stuff about contacting local representatives
guys i am gonna give you a real proof about how scummy is isp without net neutrality. [this](https://i.redd.it/zkqn68pb6bzz.png) pic is a screenshot from an app of one of the biggest isp in indonesia. as you can see you have 5 gb data left under the "sisa kuota" mark. but there is more. the "kuota lokal"(local data) mean that he can only use those data in the teritory where he bought those data plan so for example if you bought data plan in new york you can't use those data in washington DC. the "internet" mean that it's a universal data that you can use everywhere. "internet perdana" is free data from the ISP that came with the card. Videomax is a streaming service that can only used on their streaming service like HOOQ (netflix equivalent in indonesia) and supersoccertv for straming soccer matches everywhere around the world. the "kuota fb and BBM" can only used on facebook and blackberry messenger which nobody use anyway.

so only have 1 gig of data for browsing the internet, 500 mb if you are out of the city and if you want to use the rest of 4 gigs you need to use their aplication. pic from /u/reardaranda in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/7eh08w/when_a_country_doesnt_have_a_net_neutrality_laws/)
As a non American, is there anything I can do to help you guys out? I feel that you may be first but that it won't be too long until we have similar proposals in Europe.
We must save it before it takes 45 min to load a video of a cat playing the piano, dammit.
I´m from a third world country, is there something we can do? It is annoying just to sit down and watch like some poop head tries to push this damn thing every year.
Kind of funny none of this is being talked about on the news

Is this not essentially a start down a path towards the internet regulations seen in China and other Asian countries? 
How can somebody like myself from England help with this? 
How do so many people not know about this? I’m a freelance writer and I just checked a work-related forum and there’s not a single post about this. This could, and probably will, put most of us out of business because our clients will either go out of business or will have to choose between paying for visibility and paying for quality content.

Any suggestions on what Canadians can do, since we (I would think) cannot write letters to members of Congress? 
Serious question from a non-american non-lawyer who is probably talking out of his ass but is an absolute cunt and rules sharks based on the exact wording of things in card games. (If I can out argue an MTG judge I think I can do this too, right?)

Here is the exact wording of your 1st amendment:

>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances

I see several ways this can be used to protect Net Neutrality forever:  
*(I'll go from most to least serious suggestion)*

1) "abridging the freedom of speech" - The internet is a place where people can speak freely, yes? Without NN this can easily become harder, therefore free speech has been abridged, no?

2) "or of the press" - If I have to pay a service provider an extra $3 to look at Kotaku (let's just say I wanted to for some mad reason.) but CNN is free - then the freedom (as in open accessibility) of the press has been restricted.

3) "petition the government" - THE LITERAL WAY YOU DO THIS NOW IS ON THE INTERNET???

4) "religion (...) free exercise thereof" - Ok so this one is a dumb fucking suggestion but *if everyone on reddit claims that the internet is their religion and worship requires net neutrality, then that means they can't ever touch it, right?* - is that dumb enough that it might actually fucking work? Because after all what is a religion but a set of common beliefs shared by a lot of people?

Have these arguments been made and seriously considered by courts yet? Because it seems to me like any sort of repeal of NN is a massive breach of the constitution in several ways.

**Note: I genuinely want people to point out to me if and why these arguments don't work - please do not downvote anyone who plays devil's advocate in this discussion!**
WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE A LAZY REDDITOR WITH ANXIETY WHO TRIES TO HELP WITH JUST UPVOTES:

Here are 2 petitions to sign, one international and one exclusively US. 

International: https://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home

US: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality

Text "resist" to 504-09. It's a bot that will send a formal email, fax, and letter to your representatives. It also finds your representatives for you. All you have to do is text it and it holds your hand the whole way. 

WAY too many people are simply upvoting and hoping that'll be enough, this is the closest level of convenience to upvoting you can find WHILE actually making a difference. 

This effects us all.
DO. YOUR. PART.

Edit: Shoutout to u/MomDoesntGetMe for putting this together.
A month or two ago an article came out that showed a South American cellular company who had data packages segmented by web offering (a social media package, a video package etc). I'm trying to make some Net Neutrality content that will cite this example but I can't seem to find it.  Anyone have a link?
JUST SIGNED MOTHER FUCKERS!
If this issue is as serious as I'm reading, why are assassinations out of the question? a few CEOs heads rolling might get the message across better than complaining on the internet while they do what they're going to do anyway.
*Laughing in European*
I thought a free country like America listens to their citizen but It seems free country is just for Corporate house to fuck the people?
How will this affect non US countries?
Is this a losing battle? I feel like i sign these petitions and call these people every couple of years. Why does this issue need to be defended time and time again when the consensus is clear that we want net neutrality
Out of pure curiosity, who’s paying for this campaign and what do they have to gain?
[deleted]
Is there anything us europeans can do?
This thing is clearly on the negative side,
Yes you may have a point but you didnt think about the people who couldn't more money just for some sites. The internet is supposed to be open for everyone,not just for someone who can pay a lot
Can someone explain what’s happening?

With best regards a swede with no idea why my whole front page was filled with this
Couldn't they just define internet access in a way that conforms to net neutrality rules. That way any contracts that ISP's have to provide internet access would require them to follow the net neutrality rules. They could provide their crap service but would be unable to call it internet access and any exclusive deals they have with cities would require they follow the rules or breach their contract.
Olympia,WA mailbox full...good news?
As a European I want to help but don't know how besides contacting my American friends.
called my local congressman's line, "mailbox full" what do

What can Congress possibly do about this? I thought it was just up to the 5 people that lead the FCC... 
Its a shame you Americans dont feel the same level of urgency and same sense of unified action/mobilisation etc when it comes to your outta control gun culture & the lack of gun control. But i digress.. why does such a huge country as the USA have so few ISPs and hardly any competition?.. Here in the UK(a much smaller country) we have waaaay more. Surely it should be the other way round?..
I️ live right smack dab in the middle of the Bible Belt. This morning I️ decided to listen to the only political station available in my area. Which has a local conservation host from 6am-10am. To my surprise net neutrality was the main topic of discussion. I️ was also very surprised when I️ realized after about 10 minutes of listening that even conservatives in my area are heavy against the bill to end net neutrality. Even the host displayed a very strong dislike to it. So there is still hope yet!
Sign the petition! https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality
How many times do we have to go through this? It just seems to me they will keep trying until they win what they want. It is frustrating to have to go through this battle year after year. 
Is there anything a person from Eastern Europe can do? I want to help too.
As a non American (Australia) anything I can do?
If this thing goes into effect won’t people just abandon their Internet service provider? Or wouldn’t we see a drop in the amount of subscribers? I don’t understand why the FCC thinks this is a good idea anyway it would affect them too!
What if we're European? How can we help? 
As someone who's not a US resident, is there anything I can do about this?
Can I do anything as European citizen?
What can non-us citizen did to be part of, or to be helpful on this cancelling this greedy corporate efforts to erase net neutrality??
Everyone's mailbox is full.  Going to guess that makes them less likely to answer or respond.  Swine.  2018 is coming.
How can I join the fight from outside the US? I'm an American citizen and I hate this, but I can't make any calls from where I am, how could I help? 
Is there any option for us citizens currently abroad?
Assuming net neutrality is gone on the federal level, will states be able to legislate their own net neutrality law? 
100K UPVOTES ON MULTIPLE THREADS BUT ONLY 20,000 SIGNATURES??? CMON REDDIT!!!
I hate to be negative but this same thing happened when trump nominated Betsy devos and several other cabinet members, they received millions of calls and emails to not confirm this woman and she was passed through easily... congress doesn’t seem to give a shit what people want
If you guys really want to do something, have everyone at your thanksgiving gathering agree to call. Do some prep work, have a laptop out so you can look up their representative for them, and give them the info they need to either call or write an actual letter. https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative

I did! My representatives are on our side! And I left a message on the public comment page!
I'm a little out of the loop on this whole thing. Will this affect European countries aswell, or just the US?
I'd like to know how many people losing their shit about this didn't vote.  58% of eligible voters voted in 2016, which means some of you cunts have only yourselves to blame.  This is a shitty situation, but it shouldn't be a surprise.  This will pass 3-2.  Instead of signing online petitions and robo calling representatives who were already ignoring you, maybe go fucking vote.
I froze when an actual human answered... lol.  mumble mumble...I support title 2 blah blah.. hopefully they understand that.

Is there a low-key way to vote as a Canadian 😕
I live in a country where everything is under strict control. Do not let your neutrality taken away. If they take it, in the future they would take everything.
Don't fall for the bullshit people. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnP5ZgfnN58
Why would you want the Trump administration in control of the internet? Or any administration for that matter? 
If you’re not sure what net neutrality is, give this video a watch (very entertaining and informative). You WILL be effected by a lack of net neutrality!!

Good luck to you Americans
Mailbox full and no one answering. What do I do?
my rep has a full in box. is it full of constitutes  or full of corporate interests. that is a key question.
Do you really think the government will stop at regulating one single practice? What I don't get is people saying the head of the FCC is a bag man yet they want to give the FCC the power to regulate the internet as a utility.. People point to cable companies as an example of what the internet will look like without the FCC regulations and yet cable is regulated by the FCC. The fact that you don't see this is simply proof that you haven't taken the time to actually THINK.
Why not use something like IPFS that negates most of the issues that we have with ISPs in the first place.  It's decentralized and keeps everything forever.  Which is better than the current model that we use.  So... Why not?
In 2015 everyone was signing a petition to stop Net neutrality now everyone wants to protect it. The internet became public in 1991. We had a lot of years without net neutrality. I’m sure the sky won’t fall if it gets taken away. I’d be more concerned about the debt ceiling and a govt shutdown. 
Net Neutrality is the government way to take control over a the free internet we grow up with to censor the information we receive. We got to this point in history thanks to a deregulated internet. Everybody, please read. Get informed. 
Serious question here: net neutrality didn't exist until 2015 and the Internet wasn't much different than how it is now. Why would a removal now make any difference?
So you willingly want to give the government MORE control over the internet? Thought people hated the patriot act. 
Whats net neutrality and cons and state the reason we are all willing to call but when I press the post, it redirects me to vote to see every matter being voted on in Congress right now.
In the two years net neutrality has existed, what has it accomplished that a free market didn't accomplish in the 30 years prior to meet neutrality's existence?
Lol
We...did it?
So how much is everyone paying for Reddit these days? Just curious, because everyone was screaming that we'd have to pay extra for it. I haven't hit any paywalls yet, have you?
Whelp.
That didn’t work.
Shut the fuck up, who's paying for all these ads? The internet isn't going anywhere, it was fine before 2015 and it will be fine after. The FTC will have jurisdiction over consumer protection, again, so it's not like you'll be exploited to death over your precious internet. I support consumer protection, but handing over the internet to a bunch of incompetent regulators doesn't help shit. Wish they would get this utility shit out of here and pass a law that explicitly grants simple net neutrality protection, so we don't have fucking convoluted legal battles over it, but nope, that's too fucking hard because there has to be fighting, grand standing, and partisan stupidity over every fucking thing.

Recognize the fact that 90% of you idiots don't know what the fuck you are talking about, that you get your information from some partisan hack like John Oliver and suddenly become an advocate for the new flavor of the month. I'd say the same thing to a conservative base if it existed here.
I sympathize with you Americans, I really do, but why are you spamming every Reddit page with this?! Why is Reddit allowing this? 

Reddit is used by people all over the world who aren’t effected by this and would like to browse Reddit as it is  intended. I’m scrolling past net neutrality posts like mad right now!
This spam is on every subreddit today. Unacceptable. 
What is the impact of this on non-americans? I can only assume this will also have a negative effect on visiting any American websites or using American streaming services?
[deleted]
I'm from the EU and therefore I don't know that much about this whole debacle, but understand some of the implications a possible repeal might have.

Can someone explain to me how "the internet" worked in the US prior to 2015 and the Net Neutrality thing?

As far as I know there was no throttling, no limiting or any of that sort of thing before 2015, so why is everybody certain it will happen if they repeal Net Neutrality? Is there really no bad thing about Net Neutrality? 

Contrarily, is there really no good thing about repealing Net Neutrality? 

I'm asking because I don't know much, and to be honest, I haven't really seen much discussion about this - it's completely one-sided, like an echo chamber. You can't really disagree with the arguments that people post all over reddit, but my experience is that this kind of thing rarely is that simple, so please enlighten me!
It's gonna pass. And it's going to kill the internet and everything it represents. And that sucks big time.
Because the government regulating the internet is a GREAT IDEA!!!!!! 
Lmao
OH MAN THE INTERNET WAS LITERALLY HELL BEFORE 2015 s/.

Instead of making hard for people to enter the market and innovate why don't you guys pour all this energy into breaking up the ISP monopolies and deregulating  so small guys can compete.
If reddit is pushing this, it's bad news
Omfg you guys have no idea what you're shilling. 

NN will to absolutely nothing
to fix the real problem, which is local 
governments allowing the 
monopolization of ISPs in their area, 
which restricts competition. This 
gives no incentives for those 
companies to update their old wiring, 
resulting in our country's internet 
speed being among the slowest on th € 
planet. 

Oh, but here is a great solution: Let 
the government frx it. The same 
government who tried to control the 
internet through SOPA and PIPA. 
* sarcasm* 

You regards just see a nice name like "NEUTRALITY" and your ALL ABOARD w.o. even researching the history of how it got here and shit.
But America is not the internet right? Like this just doesn't affect as much of the world as people think. And if reddit is a worldwide site (www - world wide web), than why should the rest of us care? In so much as that there is a lot to care about in the world right now and mass social communication has proven nothing but disastrous. Please enlighten one so naive as myself.
I don't really understand why everyone is so worked up.

Or get rid of it and just encourage more national and regional ISPs to be built. Let it be a competitive market.

The fact that data-stealing behemoths like Google and Facebook are supporting Net Neutrality leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
It's funny how Reddit screams as whines over the Russians influencing elections through social media. Then turns around and spams it's website with the most useless shit.
I'm an ISP and I have 2 customers; Peter and Paul. They both pay me 50 dollars a month. I'm an evil greedy capitalist ISP so I'd like to raise the price but if I do then one of them will probably leave so I have to keep it at 50. Peter watches Netflix 12 hours a day which uses 95% of my bandwidth but Paul only goes on Facebook for like 30 minutes a day which uses 5%. Because of net neutrality I can't charge Peter 95 dollars and Paul 5 dollars, because all traffic must be "equal". I go and lobby the government to lift net neutrality, but Netflix gets a bunch of Reddit sheep to stop me because Peter would probably cut back on his Netflix usage which would hurt it's bottom line.

Build an ark! Repent! The flood is coming! Why God!? Why!!???

It is an important issue and we should all take it seriously; but people didn't take health care or the fucking presidential election this seriously. In fact, I've never seen people on Reddit take anything more seriously than this, which makes me wonder what's really at stake here.
JESUS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FRONTPAGE???
We crushed EA. Now we need to crush this. Fuck Comcast and Verizon if they win they'll make the ultimate pay to win and we'll be fucked.

[AMA Request] Victoria, ex-AMA mod
**My 6 Questions:**

1. How did you enjoy your time working at Reddit?
2. Were you expecting to be let go?
3. What are you planning to do now?
4. What was your favorite AMA?
5. Would you come back, if possible?
6. Are you planning to take [Campus Society's](http://blog.campussociety.com/an-open-letter-to-victoria-previously-of-reddit-become-victoria-of-campus-society/) Job offer?

**Public Contact Information:** @happysquid is her twitter (Thanks /u/crabjuice23 And /u/edjamakated!) & /u/chooter (Thanks /u/alsadius)


Edit: The votes dropped from 17K+ to 10K+ in a matter of seconds...what?

Edit again: I've lost a total of about 14K votes...Vote fuzzing seems a bit way too much

Do you remember the last time a fired Reddit employee did an AMA? I highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative PR job. 
"Victoria will be helping me out today!"
Her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired 
Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :)
I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing. 
Did this just drop 6000 upvotes? 
Let's hope OP doesn't get shadowed and this whole thread removed 
Surely the first question has to be "why were you fired?"
IM trying to find her contact info since her email wont work most likely. anyone got a lead?
She almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement
What the fuck?! I leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k?

Uhm... something's fishy, here.
Holy shit...14532 and 97% upvoted

Never thought I'd see that unless Snowden and Assange announced they were getting married. 
Did this post just go from 17k to 10k upvotes?
/u/chooter, you're our only hope.
Dude, you're about to overtake Obama's AMA in terms of upvotes after only one hour. This is a little bit mad.
An hour ago, this post was at 8000 upvootes with a 97% upvote rate. Now its at 6222 with same upvote percentage. I smell something funny.

Edit: Okay, now it's at 5300, and still at the same up vote percentage. Fuck this man. This pao bitch is on some other shit.
[removed]
This went from 13K points to 5.5K in roughly 5 hours, and this post is 97% upvoted. 
She wasn't a mod. She was an admin.
This thread dropped from 17k votes to 5k votes due to vote fuzzing... would easily have been the highest rated AMA post ever, but no, the admins had to censor it.
Realistically she won't do this because it may affect her chances of finding new employment if she speaks badly about reddit regardless of how mishandled the situation was.
Now do one for the creator of secret santa too. It's not just Victoria. Reddit wants to gut the heart of the company apparently. Apparently having a popular site isn't enough for them, and so they want the real fans that helped build the site, get stepped on until they fall in line. 
Guys, can we please stop buying Reddit Gold for a day. I feel like that'll make more of statement than the blackout bullshit. That money goes to support Reddit's higher ups. 
Who the fuck is going to moderate this, though?  Who watches the watchmen?!
When I first saw this, it was at 17,000 upvotes, now it's down to 6,200?

Why reddit? Answers are preferred...
Why the hell would she want to come back to add publicity to the site she got fired from? And why would we want to demean her by asking her to do that?
This had way more upvotes, admins are taking them away so it looses popularity.
17,000 x97%= 10,000

Checks out.
/r/justsaynope

July 10 has been suggested as a no reddit day. Don't post, comment, or even load the site. Go through the weekend if you can.

Edit: If every person that thought "this will never happen" actually went along with it, it would happen. There seems to be a lot of people upset and few willing to even find something to do other than reddit for a few days. 

I'm open to other ideas, but this is the only hope normal users have to make any kind of meaningful impact here. 

EDIT2: spread the message guys, copy this comment on big subreddits, comment on high karma posts, make posts with this message. We need people to see this in order to work and to hit where it hurts!

EDIT3: Thanks for all the support guys, hopefully with this we can show that we, the users, have a say on how Reddit is managed.

How did it go from 16k upvotes to 10k in 2 min???
You know, as much as we'd all like to see this happen, there's probably a non disclosure agreement she had to sign... Not an uncommon thing
It's a shame she was fired. I'd love to see her thoughts and opinions on current events, she's always seemed like a great person.
>Edit 3: The votes dropped form 17K+ to 10K+ in a matter of seconds...what?

Vote fuzzing. Happens to all super-big threads like this.
>Edit: The votes dropped form 17K+ to 10K+ in a matter of seconds...what?

Vote fuzzing.
I saw the post 2 hours ago with 15 000 upvotes, how does it have 7000 upvotes now with a ratio of 97%. 
ELI5 please :) ?
The vote count on this completely crashed. Messed up. So much for free speech.
Where did 3,000 votes just go? 
Didnt this thread have 14k upvotes like an hour ago? 
Seems pretty logical to have her do an AMA, even poetic maybe.

Bring her back Reddit
[removed]
97% upvoted, but went from 15k to 7k.

Something fishy is going on here.
Looks like someone at reddit HQ is messing with the up votes again...
[deleted]
How did this go from having 12,000+ upvotes to only 6,000? Bots 
Someone is fixing the up votes. 
What's with the downvote army?

This post was at 16000 upvotes, now it's below half that. 
Could dumbasses stop buying gold for people? Everyone is all up in arms against reddit yet people are still paying reddit by buying gold. 
Post is gilded. Are you guys serious about your feud with Reddit/Admins or not?
All hail Queen Victoria of House Taylor, First of her name, Queen of the Ama's, moderators, and the admin. Lady of the subreddit, and protector of the realm.
Looks like we all want Victoria's secrets 
I've also noticed the votes. Something is up with that. It went from over 16k  to just a a little over 9000, within just a few minutes
Victoria will be banned from the subReddit before she can make her first comment.  Emperor Pao will see to it, and any mod helping to make this AMA happen will be executed without a trial.
Wtf is going on with the votes? they went from 12k earlier to 10k now, ontop of it going from 17k to 10k earlier. I think Reddit is being used aganst us. 
The fuck? From 17k upvotes to 7k in an hour? How does that work?
did anyone realize that the upvote count was cut in half on this thread?
Clearly this is manipulation. 15k to 7k... "Pao's great leap forward"
There it goes again....this post was submitted on 03 Jul 2015
7,524 points (97% upvoted)
8,004 votes

Was in the 10,000's just a few minutes ago.  I also don't see IAmA on my front page where this was first post 

I love how it was 10,662 when I saw on on the frontpage, and when I clicked it, it didn't even have that many votes. I guess Someone doesn't want this happening. :P
I think that's more than just vote fuzzing… reddit is failing hard at damage control.
15k up votes in one hour, but now it has halfed. Hmmmmm.
the amount of upvotes suddenly dropped from around 17000 to 10000.. is that supposed to happen?

Edit: here's the proof: www.imgur.com/W8rmdvN (before) and www.imgur.com/wuwYedd (after)
I just sat here for 2 straight minutes refreshing just to see how fast this post was gaining up votes still, astounding. 
About the lost upvotes: https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/29j5uh/reddit_still_artificially_introduces_downvotes_on/cilwjgn?context=2

This is whats happening, and it has been happening for plenty of years now.

Without this, you would be seeing posts going into the 20k+ range on /r/all ALL the time.
If you are very interested in seeing this happen, consider posting in /r/IAmARequests and offering Reddit Gold for contacting this person and arranging the AMA! Your request will have a better chance at being fulfilled than just being posted here! And if you do post in /r/IAmARequests, make sure to tag your request with [Reward] if you're offering one, or [No Reward] if not.

Users, if you want to help contact potential AMA participants (and earn Reddit Gold) then subscribe to /r/IAmARequests!

Any chance you can get Anna Kendrick when your invevitably hired back? I need to ask her out
I was on reddit all day and just read in the news reddit shutdown. Talk about out of touch
*Never* going to happen
this appears to be getting ~ 5 upvotes per second right now.

Holy shit over 10000 now
'When an employee is dismissed from employment at a company, the policy of almost every company (including reddit) is not to comment, either publicly or internally. This is because companies have no desire to ruin someone's future employment prospects by broadcasting to the world that they were fired. In return, the polite expectation is that the employee will not go shooting their mouth off about the company especially (as in your case) through irresponsibly unfounded speculation. Signing a non-disparagement indicates that you have no intention to do this, so the company can then say "Ok, if anyone comes asking for a reference on this guy, we needn't say he was fired, just give a mildly positive reference." Even if you don't sign the non-disparagement, the company will give you the benefit of the doubt and not disparage you or make any negative statements first.'
What I don't understand is why, considering how huge Reddit has become, all these sub-reddits pretty much put all their faith into only ONE person. How very short-sided of them that one person being removed instantly brings them their to their knees.
I love that since Voat has become the go to site all the popular subs have come back up
Pretty sure there is some kind of NDA where she really can't discuss details...
50 dogecoins says this becomes the #1 upvoted reddit post of all time. :D
Holy shit, 15,000 upvotes for this?
What the fuck just happened...
Honestly like wtf. Is reddit plotting against us lol
Do NOT buy reddit gold. You need to stop funding them. The only way they will learn this has negative effects, is to hurt their cash flow
This was on around 17k upvotes just ten minutes ago.... now it's 11k?..
The drop in points is (likely) caused by a reddit algorithm called **vote fuzzing** . [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/1vehg6/gopro_on_the_back_of_an_eagle/cersffj)
Holy shit, this has more upvotes than Obama's ama already

Or not.
This thread went 6k votes down in 5 minutes... 
This fell from 15K to 9K upvotes within minutes. Shady as fuck reddit, come ahead and shadowban me
One minute this had over 15000 upvotes, and the next it's below 10000...?
This was on 15000 + upvotes when I checked last. What happened? 
Is someone messing with the algorithm so this doesn't look so popular? 
From 14k+ to 9k something? This smells stinky....
15k to 9k
Dropped another 2k votes
Let's just hope the Australians get involved!!!
[deleted]
I feel like SRS is vote manipulating. This was at 17k and then 14 and now 10? Something fucky is afoot.
Why support Reddit with another AMA. 
Another vote drop. From 10K to 7K
You mean to tell me that ~8k people just down voted this post? Fishy folks. Very fishy.
WTF IS GOING ON HOW IS THIS DOWN VOTED SO MUCH?????
Um, I could have sworn there was something like 10k likes on this a couple hours ago...
the upvotes went from 12k to 7k on this thread
I want to know all of Victoria's Secrets!
This would be the most upvoted post of all time OP
What the heck happened to the votes 
She's got twitter. @happysquid
Victoria, no question but I hope digg pulls the trigger and pulls out the wallet to get you running AmAs on it.
It appears mine and your post are still loosing upvotes. You from 17k-5k. Me from 15k-4k. 

I'm going to assume this drop is going to continue.
Pao created 7k new accounts and down voted this. But we'll create more and up vote.
Love how the upvotes say 97% upvoted but it went from 16k upvotes down to 10k. Nothing suspicious there. *cough*
Wtf the upvotes went down ?
What the actual fuck. Don't tell me they aren't messing with the upvotes now.
1. Why are you so awesome?
2. Will you be my friend?
3. Considering all you have done to help the reddit (AMA), community, how would you like to see the sub evolve, grow, or change (or not)?
4. Coke or Pepsi?
FROM OVER 16K TO NOW UNDER 10K UPVOTES?? WTF ?!?
This topic had 17K votes a a little bit ago? With 97% upvotes, how did it lose almost 50% of it's votes? seems shady.

After I posted this, it went back to 10k, now back down to 7k. Way to make a bad situation worse. Is Reddit tampering with it's vote system? The entire basis of it's existence. Great job EP.
Before Reddit flips out over the upvotes, this always happens when a post  rises fast. No big conspiracy going on, just the normal upvote program. I've seen it many a times. Just fyi /u/korantano 
"Hi there! I'm Victoria, and nobody is helping me with my AMA because I'M FUCKING VICTORIA!"
Can anyone shed some light on what is going on with the vote deletion? 

Have we lost control of /r/IAmA?
With the votes thing... TIL Reddit only lets you see what it wants you to see, lost a lot of respect for this site. Reddit feels a lot like it is crashing and burning.. 
This is down to 5k up votes, In total I believe it has lost at least 20k up votes. How is this normal?
Just noticed the upvotes dropped... Someone doesn't want this post at the top of top,all.
17k to 10k votes....I made this account earlier and did a TIFU post that was on the frontpage, it was then censored and removed.

Someone is definitely fudging the numbers and hiding things.

Edit: the post TIFU by firing an employee.

I only wanted to totally monetize a popular website and now I'm the bad guy.

http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3bz1jm/tifu_by_firing_an_employee/
How do you feel about Reddit's reaction to your departure?
Don't all ask questions that would obviously break her NDA and this might happen :).
this needs to be done
Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :)
Guys, I know this is sweet and all but may she'd like to be left alone for a while? 

I know I would but that's me. 
Q6. Are you free? Tonight?
Oh shit Iama is back
The Users could donate 5 bucks each to makeup for the severance losses - no? This AMA must be all revealing.. 

Will be better than that boxing match between some well built, fit people hugging each other for a few hours in the pretext of fighting, instead of actually doing it.

Victoria here today with Victoria. 
Yeah, if it were to happen reddit admin would just delete any answers that they don't like before 99% of us ever get to see them.  I would suspect lots of censorship would happen.
Less than an hour to make the top of the front page. Ha, holy shit!
I will transcribe Victoria's responses for her in case she, uh, doesn't know how to use computers.
FCC just voted to kill Net Neutrality. Now we will SUE THEM and FIGHT in Congress! We are Free Press & friends. AMA
The FCC just voted to throw out the Net Neutrality protections. Now cable and phone companies are free to block, slow down, or charge for fast lanes for content on the internet. This vote was a complete disregard for public opinion, facts and the law itself. 

Free Press will be suing the FCC and fighting this in Congress in the coming months. I'm a lawyer for Free Press here with our friends & allies and we're happy to answer any of your questions on Net Neutrality. AMA!

What specifically are you planning on suing them for? I completely agree with your motion by the way, I just want more information.
What's the timeline for all of this going to look like? And what are the legal battles and congressional actions that we should be keeping an eye on in the coming months?
As a run-of-the-mill American citizen, what can I do to help at this point?
What exactly can you do that people haven't already tried? 
Fuck them up. 

Please?
>Now cable and phone companies are free to block.

This is by far the biggest issue. Everyone is up in arms that their Netflix/FB/Instagram might get throttled. But I don't think any ISP in their right mind would do that because they would either be facing riots or hemorrhaging customers. (Edit: see edit below) 

Blocking information in the internet allows ISPs to manipulate and groom their customers for whatever agenda they want. This is beyond just a politics. This is a violation of 1st amendment rights. 

Are you guys thinking along these lines?

**Edit**

Okay to clarify - they may not be hemorrhaging customers, but if you do anything to take entertainment away from Americans you will not have a good time. Its like the kid that wants candy at the grocery store. They are gonna start yelling and screaming to make a scene. 

But my main point here is people seem so fixated on the Netflix/Fb/etc. But the real problem is that ISPs can now control knowledge/information. Now apply Murhy's law. 

The FCC chairman has claimed there is no proof of bandwidth throttling, yet I do recall that Netflix and Comcast had many issues in the past.

What proof will you bring to your case? Or do you have any tech experts on your side? Can you get Bill Gates?
Has anything like this (from the FCC or other regulatory organization) been overturned in court? If so, how long could it take? The courts are very slow of course, but could public interest increase the speed? Are you thinking within 2 years? 4 years / in the next administration? 

*edit: fixed some spelliing
To what extent does the FCC's decision to disregard (1) the quantity of pro net neutrality comments, and (2) the "cyberwar" campaign to flood the site with fake comments affect whether a court will conclude today's vote was arbitrary and capricious? 

The "arbitrary and capricious" doctrine sets a high standard of proof necessary to prevail in a civil action. 
Just me being curious here. Is there any way that I as an European would be able to show my support for American net neutrality? 
Do you think there is a chance of success of repealing the repeal?
Serious question.  Did you sue them before 2015? If so what was the outcome? Is that how we got NN originally?
[deleted]
I'm a lawyer and would love to join your cause. Do you need more litigators?

What's to stop every state from just making their own ISPs that don't charge for fast lanes? How is Comcast stopping them? 
How can we help from the other side of the world?
This whole thing infuriated me so much. It’s blatant disrespect, we’re losing our rights to the internet which is a HUGE part of communications in society. And for what? So a select group of people can profit while millions are fucked over. If we are actually a part of a democracy then this topic should have died a long time ago. Just goes to show how much the people of the US are valued in the eyes of our government. What as average citizens can we do if this follows through?
[removed]
Will the ISPs be able to screw over its customers while the lawsuit is ongoing or would they have to wait till it’s concluded? 

Edit: just in case you can’t see the answer because of the deleted comment below me, they will be able to start screwing us over. 
I hope I'm not too late to get an answer:

Assuming we contact legislators who have come out **in favor** of the FCC's decision, what are we likely to hear as support for the decision? What would be a suitable counter argument?
Hey, I've supported NN regulation unwaveringly for awhile. Recently I've started seeing some articles that are providing counter arguments to some popular pro-NN points. Primarily a) it's going to help competition b) the examples of NN violations in the past were over-exaggerate and/or eventually fixed themselves and c) fast lanes and zero ratings aren't that big of a deal and won't really hinder innovation. I'm curious what the counter-counter argument would be. Secondly, will it be legal for comcast (for example) to throttle all other services other than NBC or would that be considered anti-competitive? Thanks! 
What does the waffle sign behind you say? 
Doesn't blocking content count as a restriction of free speech?
I have a friend who thinks that net neutrality is a bad thing, because "with it the government can control what we see" rather than providers.. Even when informed about the protections under the first amendment from censorship (besides what has been established as censorable) as well as the permanent internet tax ban, he still believes it is worse to have net neutrality than not. 


What further points or information can I bring to the table (from a legal or economical standpoint) in order to show him what net neutrality really means?


Thank you, as well, for taking the steps to reverse the FCC's actions

How would this affect the users of Tor?
Why is the repeal of Title II bad? I keep hearing that it'll let ISPs throttle and unfairly favor their own services, etc, but what about Title II prevented them from doing that?

How many lawsuits do you think got filed today?

Is the goal to get Congress to introduce legislation that is better suited to the unique nature of the Internet?

Is there any danger that this is a ridiculous chess game, that the FCC ruling is a trap, and that Congress is going to introduce legislation favorable the ISPs "because the people want it"?

How does Net Neutrality improve the service that the ISPs provide? It should prevent them from unfairly throttling traffic, but how does that address the accused regional monopolies and harcore lobbying to prevent municipal broadband, or introduce ways to increase competition amongst ISPs?
With all this taking place, I think that it is important to say this.

While this is something that we all need to be fighting for, Please remember that at the end of the day threatening someone is not acceptable. Do not threaten to end someones life, LET ALONE THEIR FAMILIES, over this matter.

If you want to be taken seriously, be a grown adult, speak your piece and move on. Do not threaten someones kin, you just look pathetic then.

I cant say this enough, you are no worst than them when you make threats.


So ask yourself this, "Am I being respectful and morally just"?
 I knew this would happen. How can we the people do anything when we are obviously being ignored? Will the suing do anything or will they just find another way to get rid of net neutrality?
Hey, thanks for taking the time to fight the good fight.

That said, is anything a humble network engineer can offer in terms of technical insight? Especially as to how this could potentially affect consumers. Obviously this is a very complex issue and I'd be more than happy to help.

Best of luck.
Your brilliant work on there actually being an increase in infrastructure investment pre and post 2015 Open Internet Order is directly contrary to the FCC's erroneous finding that Title II classification hurt infrastructure investment.

Are there plans to double down and fight this misinformation?
Does the FCC ever act in the interest of the people? It seems like their only purpose is to fuck over citizens and make money for evil companies. Good luck suing those corrupt fuckers.
How likely is it that they are going to get away with this in the end?
Maybe a stupid question here (and maybe someone else asked?), but if the American majority is against something, is it legal to sue for false representation from our senators? I mean, we are clearly not being listened to by our Congress if the statistics I read are true (80% of people against the repeal). So what of that? 
When will they start charging me? When will it go into effect?
Is there anything you can do as someone that doesn't live in the us? I remember a petition needed a us phone number a while ago, so that didn't work out.
Can anybody tell me- why was this decision left to the FCC and not to Congress? Or is this one of the reasons people are mad? I've been wondering this since I started hearing about net neutrality but I missed something.
Why do congressmen even discuss something that is so obviously bad for every American except for the few that stand to profit from this?
should we prepare to move to lower tier packages for our internet? i imagine ISP companies will start raising the price of pre-existing tiers.
If i hit the send letter button, but I don’t call congress, does it still send the letter? I don’t have time to read off a script.
I'm a big Obama fan, but couldn't understand why he appointed Ajit Pai as the head of the FCC. Ajit Pai was one of the authors of the legislation proposed in 2014 to allow cable companies to regulate bandwidth (remember Netflix telling people "it's not us, it's your ISP that won't let you stream?)

My question is what influence do the American people have over the FCC chairman? I think the biggest problem is that Ajit Pai it's just a cable company patsy and has no place as the head of the FCC.

Edit spelling
Since they didn't listen before, what can I, a high school student, do to help save what I love?
As a canadian is there any way I can help you guys out in this fight? I don't think writing to congress via these links will work since I'm from the land up north. I'm donating money to you guys though. Just wo dering if there is more I can do
We need more than just net Neutraility. Something has to get comcrap and att to get their shit together. They put laws in my municipality to prohibit community broadband and then let the infrastructure rot so they can say we need to repeal net Neutraility. Getting the title 2 protections back is only half the game. How can we next punish the incumbent isps for doing this?

How long is it going to take before this case is heard?
What do you think of the U.N. announcement that internet is a human right back in 2011?

Remember how David Miscavige got Scientologists to completely backlog the IRS with lawsuits until the IRS finally gave up and declared Scientology tax-free? Could a similar tactic work here?
Will you sue Verizon as well?  There must be some way that they violated the rules before they were actually changed.
Can’t everyone just stop paying for the internet? If hundreds of thousands or even millions of people stop paying this will cause massive issues.
How can I help? 
What’s stopping someone from starting an ISP with a NN business model? For some reason I think it would be near impossible, but I honestly have no clue why. 

EDIT: and is it conceivable that an existing ISP would do so as a competitive advantage? 

Edit two: Found this comment by /u/odaeyss on another post, which pretty much answers my question:

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7jtkqp/comment/dr9ez3y?st=JB76T03D&sh=de6ec154

the text of which is:

Verizon and Comcast managed to achieve regulatory capture sooner than Google anticipated, and basically Google can't touch the poles that might be public but contain private lines *and a monopoly on access to those poles*. So Google needs to lay some fiber, that means they need to run it on poles, or through conduit... but let's say it's Comcast territory. Google might get all the permits to do the work, but Google can't access the poles or conduit themselves. They need Comcast. And that went about as well as you would expect. Comcast has no interest in doing anything that will harm them by allowing competition.  
That's a super-simple drunk history of what happened in a few of the places Google was trying to run fiber, and why they gave up.  
Mr. Laroia, is Ajit Pai your evil twin brother?

In all seriousness, I strongly believe you and everyone with you will restore Net Neutrality. May the Force be with you all!
Is there any sort of tracker to show ISPs' actions following this decision to remove protections?
what can people outside the US do to help? 
Does anybody remember Free TV? It was Free because of Commercials and homeowners had a Antenna on the Roof which received a signal from Huge TV antennas in all cities and blah blah blah.Watch Buzzr TV and the old game shows, they did live commercials.That Money payed for the TV's operation cost and Employees.When cable first came out and My 82 year old Mother can attest to this and She still has the Receipts.A Comcast door to door Salesmen knocked and She let Him in and listened to His speech and the main selling point was there are No Commercials that's why you pay a small fee for the commercial free service.Eventually there were Commercials but very little and Comcast slowly introduced more and more and at same time raised prices little by little.These Company's get plenty of Money from commercials it's a  staggering amount.So now all these Company's follow Comcast way of Business which is greedy.The Money You spend on cable, satellite and now the Internet is Free money for these companies.All those ads you see goes to these companies.You know that extra fee to get HD guess what it's free.I Cut the Cord when everything went digital and now I use the antenna on My roof that's been there since the 80's and everything is in HD while dummies pay for it.These companies slowly try to get away of charging erroneous Fees and charges.If nobody says anything they will continue to Screw the consumer.
I know I'm late to the party but, I spent the entire day without the internet thinking of how to protest effectively and without violence. After watching the live stream, it was evident who was for a dollar and who was for the citizens of this country. It was spot on how the two women chairmen  (I forget their names, please forgive) almost tore the house down in opposition, saying everything we all thought. 

They said the last year and the current they have hit their cap of four-hundred million dollars, while actions of the FCC's vote are in question; in the longer term the financial usage that led to those caps should be put into investigation as well. While people can't afford 900 dollar pills because they have a disability that they could not help; the chopping block has programs of the health of the people square in its sights but not something as suspect as this? The night before, various large companies put out updates that say "speed and optimization".

Specifically calling out Facebook for putting adds on video's that have no skip but promote ISP's, at the same point Google announced a wireless program that basically was crafted specifically around NN going away, a plan that would take more than short time to plan and implement while both were noticeably silent on the issue. Not to mention, the places ISP's own that are news outlets had little to no coverage at all about a vote that changes everything.

Despite all of this, and despite the FCC being an independent sect of government; multiple officials were denied entry even through the door, two million stolen identities confirmed before the vote even happened, over twenty-four million comments, letters, and outcrys with and estimated 83% favor of keeping Title 2, all of this was neither entered as fact nor even a concern save for the only two representing the people in the room who voted no and jokes about language and comment from Sir Spud about looking like a "potato" and retorts from the benefactor in-cheif about ads and promoted tweets already happening.

First, that's offensive; a potato has more substance and is a food many people like. Second, if the ads were running and promoted tweets were against the rules of Net Neutrality; you should probably resign as this admission was a direct statement claiming knowledge of misconduct from companies in public view without any punishment or investigation by the head of the FCC himself. Knowledge of an act against a department of government's law without action seems like a crime right? It is. Just to be clear, it is. Also, if any donations or money or even a half eaten donut were taken as a bribe and at least three were involved, it's not only a crime of accepting a bribe but technically a federal conspiracy to commit a crime. It's called a RICO Conspiracy and all can be charged the same (thank you The Dark Knight for this. It's bad when a movie is more factual than the FCC). 

Furthermore, even if they believed in the vote, the country that gives them power is a Democratic nation. If, a government branch of the United States (even if elected to make decisions), makes a decision while publicly ignoring the majority or the public at all for that matter, this would be an act against the people of the country. It's true, it's what we founded the country on in the first place. Remember learning about the Boston Tea Party in grade school? It's fortunate because history is almost not being considered worth teaching in schools yet those same schools require Internet connection for students who are issued laptop's that are mandatory. Today, the Tea is taxed and tainted so much that we have to dump it into the harbor and ask how the Tea keeps ending up in this harbor!

Now despite my own concerns about utilities like water, electrical power, or... say, the INTERNET; there is no question that the Internet is now no longer a convenience, it's a part of everyday life that makes it essential to function. We pretty much made this set in stone when we started giving four year olds Iphones and made it more normal to facetime with your neighbor while playing GTA instead of going outside and like... doing... play. No, slides and swingsets are more obsolete than what the kid on multiplayer say's he's made your mom. We might stomp that little newb into a k/d so low that they throw their controller into a tv, but like it or not, it's how we are evolving. Technology, is the glassware we use to hydrate; the Internet is almost water. That we drink. To live. UTILITY.

It's the day after the vote to take away something that has become a part of us and put a fee inside a hidden fee on it. The Senate is next, after that it will already be violent because the changes will start stacking and the people won't even vote. It'll be 88 mph all the way to the steps that lead to a nation. This why history is so important, we learn from our mistakes, we use what we learn to avoid more mistakes, we grow and in the process try not to start actually battles over something that brings people together like the Internet should.

If you skipped or made it this far, I fully support the overturn of the vote yesterday and pursue criminal action for infringement upon our civil liberties, rights that founded this very nation.
What can I say to my representatives to convince them to fight for Net Neutrality? ( for emails and phone calls) 
Go get 'em, guys. 

Title II "Telecommunications Service" was always the correct classification.   The Internet was never akin to CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy ... these are "Information Services", the wrong classification that the Internet was classified as prior to 2015.    

**Is there a legal basis for fighting this repeal because day is not, in fact, night  and oranges are not, in fact, apples?**  
I heard it mentioned more than once in the proceedings that the current law allows for ISPs to throttle/block/provide "fast lanes," but they aren't. The argument they are making is that repealing NN title 2 legislation will not suddenly spur these ISPs to take these actions for fear of consumer backlash. What are your thoughts on this?
What can people outside of the US do to help?
First off, thank you for offering the AMA.

Can you help me understand why we should support Net Neutrality in spite of the recent global trend towards a la carte everything in the telecom world, which has been widely supported and recognized as the proper model for innovation?  If you look at cable television or cellular service providers, for example, these industries have been revolutionized because of a push towards pay-for-use models.  Companies like Netflix, T-Mobile, and Sling TV have found success specifically because they've flown in the face of the old one-price-for-all formula, and instead began offering consumers the optionality to pay only for what they needed and used.  The fundamental idea driving this is that those users towards the bottom of the usage pool essentially subsidized the costs of the users with the highest usage.  The innovation towards the a la carte business model has led to lower costs, greater optionality, and an increased number of offerings for consumers.  Why, then, wouldn't we want to do the same for the internet?  It is a fact that the United States, on average, has among the lowest speeds and highest prices in the world.  For all we know, prices may go down for the average user by repealing Net Neutrality.  Would appreciate your comments.  Thanks!


What if I told you there was nothing in the existing net neutrality rules that stopped providers from throttling speeds, blocking content, or creating fast lanes?

https://techliberation.com/2017/07/12/heres-why-the-obama-fcc-internet-regulations-dont-protect-net-neutrality/

> The 2016 court decision upholding the rules was a Pyrrhic victory for the net neutrality movement. In short, the decision revealed that the 2015 Open Internet Order provides no meaningful net neutrality protections–it allows ISPs to block and throttle content. As the judges who upheld the Order said, “The Order…specifies that an ISP remains ‘free to offer ‘edited’ services’ without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2017/05/15/can-isps-simply-opt-out-of-net-neutrality/

> But the DC Circuit suggests that a walled garden is fine as long as the provider “mak[es it] sufficiently clear to potential customers that if provides a filtered services involving the ISP’s exercise of ‘editorial intervention.’”

Court document here,

https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf

**TL;DR: Nothing in previous rules prevented ISPs from throttling or blocking content. Just like before 2015.**


How do you reconcile property rights with dictating to certain individuals what they may and may not, must and must not, do with their property?
What grounds do you have to sue them? I don't like losing net neutrality either, but you actually have to prove damages or that the repeal was unconstitutional/violates federal law.
[deleted]
Do you really think this will affect your life that much?  If so, how and provide proof via your own analysis if possible?
Why do you think it is that people haven't realized that telecom companies are taking about charging for content that doesn't belong to them while using lines that for the most part subsidized from tax payers?
Can you explain to me how it passed? It was a committee vote. Pai is the one catching all the blame, but who are these other members and how did they get there?

If ISPs are outnumbered and outmanned by not only corporations negatively affected by the repeal, but also consumers, how are they able to get this passed? The FCC is here to protect the consumer, or so I thought, and if that is heir purpose, how is this ethical/legal? (Knowingly acting in bad faith).

How do we turn the internet into a protected utility or make it a right? 
Just wondering, are there any people who wouldn't benefit financially from this that support repealing NN?
Soon our ability to fight this online will be gone... then what?!?
As citizens, what can we do to help you?
I hear all the time about intentions of taking huge organizations like the FCC to court and more often than not, I'll see a headline saying that some other organization is suing, and then never hear a word about it again. Why is this and is this something that is within the realm of possibility for your case?
I’m American citizen, undecided voter, loving husband Ken Bone, Welcome to the Bone Zone! AMA
Hello Reddit,

I’m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn’t see any of this coming, it’s been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I’m donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis.

I’m an open book doing this AMA at my desk at work and excited to answer America’s question.

Please support the campaign and the fight on homelessness! [Represent.com/bonezone](https://represent.com/bonezone/)

Edit: signing off now, just like my whole experience so far this has been overwhelmingly positive!  Special thanks to my Reddit brethren for sticking up for me when the few negative people attack.  Let's just show that we're better than that by not answering hate with hate.  Maybe do this again in a few weeks when the ride is over if you have questions about returning to normal.

My client will be answering no further questions.

NEW EDIT:  This post is about to be locked, but questions are still coming in.  I made a new AMA to keep this going.  [You can find it here!](https://redd.it/63posi)


What was the process in order to actually ask the candidates your question? Did you sign a form, request using email yada yada yada.

Where did you get your pictures developed?

Hey Ken,

I just wrote an essay about you for my English class. (our assignment was to rant about something we're passionate about) What do you think? Here it is:

&nbsp;

Ken Bone: Our Deliverance From Evil

&nbsp;

As the ever-deepening morass of modern American politics grows ever more bizarrely phantasmagoric, as we descend farther and farther into madness and hysteria, logic becomes foreign, truth becomes elusive, the absurd becomes normal. It should come as little surprise, then, that the American public remembered nothing of the second presidential debate - not the preposterous prevarications, not the vitriolic vilifications, not anything of that turbulent tempest - they remembered nothing other than a portly and mild-mannered man from Illinois, clad in a quaint and charming red sweater, brightly curious about energy policy.

The American people, already nearly devoid of hope, could viscerally feel their last vestiges of optimism being painfully crushed from their souls as they watched two people, one of whom will soon become perhaps the most powerful human being on Earth, hurl invective at each other, talk over one another and the moderators, evade inquiry of any sort, obfuscate rather than clarify their positions. Donald J. Trump, that grotesque, corn silk-haired love child of a toad and an Oompa-Loompa, even went so far as to threaten his opponent.

So, once again, it should come as little surprise that America, seeking some ray of hope amid the ghastly cataclysm of this debate unfolding before their terrified eyes, focused in one the one glimmering point of light that shone through the darkness: Ken Bone.

Kenneth Dean Bone: the Internet’s darling, and a true American hero. Like others before him, he stood, he spoke, he sat, and that was all. But there was something special about Ken Bone; something about his kindly face, spectacled and mustachioed, something about his stylish red sweater, something about the innocence of his manner as he rose and asked the candidates his question, something that spoke to the American people. Ken Bone spoke of energy policy, but the American people heard this: I am a good man, a man worthy of your love. In an election season filled with the scurrilous lies and unbridled hatred of serpentine politicians, here was a man America felt it could admire. And so, Ken Bone was catapulted to instant Internet fame.

America can feel the walls closing in. Terrorist threats, racial tensions, an environmental catastrophe that threatens to destroy us all: the free world needs a hero to pluck us from the brink of the abyss. But no such hero has yet appeared. The rapacious and foul-mouthed Donald Trump versus the hypocritical and duplicitous Hillary Clinton; neither seems nearly fit for the task. So when a friendly-looking and, frankly, adorable red-sweatered man by the name of Ken Bone rises to ask a question about energy policy with - is that a glimmer of joy? Or, at the very least, the absence of utter resignation? His affect shocks us. Ken Bone seems as if he was teleported to us from an alternate reality, in which the world is a safe and good place, where those in positions of power are sensible and moral, in which an upstanding American citizen might proudly and cheerfully do his civic duty, attending political debates and asking questions. Ken seems to have hope; thus his aura of innocence. For who but the most innocent, the most pure, who could have hope in a world such as ours? America wants to share in his hope - it wants to believe in Ken Bone. Ken immediately comes across as warm, affectionate, optimistic, and candid, qualities as rare as unicorns in today’s political landscape. “Ken Bone Is the Only Honest Man in This Election,” proclaims Esquire magazine. Truly, this righteous man was the one bastion of virtue amid the hideous depravity of the second presidential debate, and has been recognized as such by the hundreds of thousands who have flocked to him and what he stands for. Even his name is suggestive of that innocence, honesty, and optimism that he has come to stand for. Ken Bone. Say it: Ken Bone. Who could fail to adore a man by the name of Ken Bone? Truly, say this humble hero’s followers, as long as there are Ken Bones in this world, all is not lost. To which I say: Ken Bone for president.

What led to you asking about the environment? Is that your biggest concern with these candidates or did the topic just feel unaddressed?
I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.
I’m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I’ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can’t wait to answer your questions.

If you’re wondering what I’ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.

Melinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.

One of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.

If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I’ll answer as many as I can later on.

I work in health-care in South Africa and I just want to say thank you for the work that your foundation has been doing for HIV research here. Your willingness to help those who have less than you is something that I truly admire and aspire to.

My question is how do I feel like I'm doing enough? With all the pain and suffering that I see everyday, it's hard to feel like I am actually making a difference in the grand scheme of things. How do you deal with feeling like it's a never ending struggle to actually make a difference and help people?

Edit: I've noticed a lot of people giving gold and silver in this ama. Please consider donating the money instead to worthy causes. I'm sure Mr Gates would appreciate that a lot more. Thank you. And a big thank you to everyone for their kind words, I really do appreciate it.

Hi Bill, what do you think about Rutger Bregman's recent comments at Davos? is it even possible for governments to compel billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes, even if they wanted to?
What do you think can be done to combat the anti-vax movements?
What’s your advice for someone who’s been working for a few years, but is still trying to figure out what they truly want to do in life?

What's your view on various (lack of) privacy policies by various companies (eg, Facebook getting individual health data from 3rd party apps), and how do you think such behavior will shape tech going forward? Likewise, what's your view of GDPR, and what challenges does it impose for major tech companies?

Finally, do you think governments are doing a successful job corralling the desires of private entities when it comes to user's rights? What policy changes, if any, do you think consumers need?

What do you think of Elon Musk?
As someone who lives in a rural area, I'm increasingly frustrated by the lack of access to broadband internet. Where do you see America bridging this gap? Is there a technology on the horizon that will allow for an efficient, purely market-based scaling of broadband around the world (e.g. Elon Musk's grand vision of global satellite broadband)? Or do you believe the government should play a role in expanding the infrastructure into underserved areas (a la the TVA of the 30's)? Do you have a particular vision for this, yourself? (i.e. what do you think would be the best route forward?)
Would you or would you not pick up a dollar on the street?
Universal basic income. Could it work? Should it be the way forward?

If not how do we adapt to the changing role of automation and work?

What are your views on the future of education with the rise of the internet? I find it interesting how colleges and textbooks are more expensive than ever (adjusted to inflation) in a time when one can access all sorts of information for free through internet.     I believe education should be a life long endeavor for everyone and this can be made affordable through the use of technology. I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you!

Hello Bill ! When did you consider yourself a success?
Hi Mr. Gates!  Do you ever like, just randomly get up when you're home and make yourself a peanut butter sandwich?  Or do you have people do that for you?

What is the best book you've read in 2018?
What are the most promising new ways to fight malaria? 
Hey Bill. First off, thanks so much for everything you do for society. You've turned your profound success into opportunities for millions more to succeed.

As for my question - I completely agree with the stance you and Melinda discussed in your annual letter, where you stress that the onus of owning future change lies in the hands of the greater population. Too often, though, I feel that even though hundreds, thousands, or sometimes millions of people can hold opinions and strive for change, corporations still hold the vast power for change. You touched on it briefly in #7, but how do you convince corporations to look beyond short-term equity growth into the big picture of their role as changemakers within an increasingly border-less world?
Is it true that if I forward the email in my inbox to 100 people you will give me money?
Hey Bill, what’s your favorite beer?
While the Gates Foundation is tackling several major issues, it seems like transport is an important issue that is overlooked.  Specifically, the impediments of inadequate transportation or inefficient transportation is a major contributor to a number of issues including poverty, vaccine delivery, education, etc.  Having spent over 25 years in the transportation analysis field, I keeps coming to the same conclusion that transportation is an important, but undervalued issue in bettering the human condition.  Has this been tackled or discussed within your circles?
Whats your opinion on Crypto Currencies?
This is extremely important.

Mr. Gates,
when we hear the word blockchain, we usually think of Bitcoin and the thousands of other cryptocurrencies. However, many, including myself, believe that the underlying blockchain technology is even more important than the currency itself. I've created a program called [BloodChain](http://bloodchain.org) which tracks blood donations on the blockchain in an attempt to make blood safer and stop the unneeded spread of HIV/AIDS through untested blood donations.

My question to you is: has the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation looked at the uses of blockchain technology in furthering your mission to eradicate disease and promote equality?
If you dropped a $100 bill, would you stop to pick it up?

Hi Bill,

I'm currently a medical entomologist working in the UK. What's your opinion on the overmedicalization of global health? Do you think words like 'innovative tools' and your Grand Challenges funding programme take focus away from long term solutions. It seems like we are all so focused on tools and drugs, short term solutions, rather than focusing on issues that would be a long term fix, e.g. improvements on infrastructure, sociopolitical factors. As people say, prevention is cheaper than cure. What is your foundation doing to address this?
I am Leah Remini, Ask Me Anything about Scientology
Hi everyone, I’m Leah Remini, author of Troublemaker : Surviving Hollywood and Scientology. I’m an open book so ask me anything about Scientology. And, if you want more, check out my new show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, tonight at 10/9c on A&E.

I'm a former Scientologist and Sea Org member. I was raised in Scn and joined the SO as a 15-year-old girl and was in for six years. I'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse I endured in the SO. I just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. I feel like even when people are rightly negative about Scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. So, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it.  What has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?


How much did you pay to the church throughout your time there? 
Is it true they record your meetings and blackmail you with the recordings?

If all Scientology's secrets were revealed tomorrow, which do you think would be most shocking?
Can you imagine a scenario where you may be cast alongside a Scientologist or would it not be allowed?
Are you still in contact with any friends that are still part of the church?  
When you were a scientologist did you ever get any weird reactions from other famous people?
Was there a secret group of people or friends you had in the church that doubted it? Or did you feel alone.
Do you think there are members of the cult of Scientology reading this AMA?
How are they able to recruit intelligent people into what appears to be an obvious scam and cult? 
What do you think Scientology will look like in 50-100 years? Do you think it has longevity or is it going to come to an end?
Considering that Scientology is consistently painted in such a negative light how did you maintain the commitment to Scientology for so long?
What OT level are you?
What is something the average citizen can do to help prevent Scientology growth?
Do the higher ups know it's a scam or do they really believe this crap?
What is the most unusual 'corrective action' you've seen them physically do to someone?
Was there a single breaking point that convinced you to leave the church? Or was it a long term struggle with the decision?



Over the past 10 years, I've seen my parents get deeper and deeper into Scientology. Decent reasoning, science and logic have done nothing to convince them to question the church. From someone who left, is there anything a loved one can do to help a brainwashed member see the truth, without ruining the relationship completely?

How are children treated in Scientology?
Are you safe?
What's is the single most horrible thing you encountered in the ""church""?
Do you think the American people will we ever get any justice on Operation Snow White?

(ELI5 for people who don't know: Scientology infiltrated the US govt and blackmailed and intimidated officials with the info they gleaned, and instead of punishment, the org won tax exempt status. Yes, you read that right: Scientology *bullied the IRS into submission*. If you think about that, it's mind blowing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White )
How different would you say your view of Hollywood is now compared to when you were on Saved by the Bell and did your experience with Scientology effect these views versus if you never joined them? 
What is your overall opinion on organized Religion now? Did your view on say Christianity change?
From what I've seen of Scientology, it seems like there is a major difference in treatment between celebrity "followers" and folks in Sea Org who are tortured, locked in the Hole, beaten publicly by Miscavige, etc. 

Did the news of this mistreatment find its way to celebrities and general "members" of the Church who weren't in Sea Org?  Or were people left completely in the dark?
As a psychologist, I am curious what you observed as mental health 'treatment' with Scientology?  In addition, I am aware the 'church' is against psychology; how was this opposition demonstrated within or by the 'church'?  Finally, in your opinion how prevalent are mental health difficulties with the Scientology community?

Thank you for your time.
Did being a Scientologist help your acting career? 
How can we destroy scientology? 
[deleted]
We can (almost correctly) assume that celebrities receive special treatment because of their status - could you elaborate more on that? For instance, how would your experiences in the church differ from someone who is not a celebrity?

And a follow up - do you think that more celebrities would like to break free from the church but are afraid because of the repercussions? Is there any merit to the claim that there's so much dirt on them that could be exposed that they may not want to leave?

Hope you convince others to follow your path!

Edited to thank some kind people for PM's and also to thank the angry people that doubt me. The fact is I'm telling the truth, but wish I wasn't. I was born into a church that ruined my family, took many of my good years, and hard earned cash. Believe what you will.
So, Xenu. When do you first learn about him when you join the church?
Hi Leah,
What are your thoughts on Louis Theroux's recent ' My Scientology Movie'? 
Did you try to persuade Zack Morris to join Scientology during your summer together at Malibu Sands?
Hi Leah! 

What influence does the Church of Scientology have on U.S. politics? Any examples you've witnessed?


In Germany many schools make scientology a topic in school (mostly in social studies, religious education or ethic class) and try to teach children about the risks - often by inviting people who left scientology. 
Is there anything similar in the US and would you think it is a good way to avoid getting into scientology?

About 20 years ago we had a woman in school who did a lecture about scientology. She left the church and talked about how scientology went after her for about a year. They sent people to her family telling them what a bad person she was and she had guys in cars following her everywhere she went until she got help from the police - happened in Germany in the 90s.

It helped me a lot to understand scientology as an organisation and it's often compared with the propaganda and influence of the nazis on the German youth back in the 1930s.
[deleted]
Is there anything GOOD about Scientology?
Are you going to spill the beans on everything you know about Scientology, or is there some stuff that is taboo even if it's just for interpersonal reasons?
What do you think makes this cult so attractive to people willing to join?  Do they peruse any particular type of person?

Hello Bill Gates. What is your idea of success?
Hey Bill! I have a question pertaining to an issue in the U.S. and it's one that we're all get sick of hearing.

Do you think social media - [and perhaps the internet in general](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/13/internet-confirmation-bias) - has played a role in helping divide this country? 

Instead of expanding knowledge and obtaining greater understandings of the world, [many people seem to use it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/)

1) seek and spread information - including false information - confirming their existing biases and beliefs, and

2) converse and interact only with others who share their worldview

(these are things I'm guilty of doing myself)

Follow up q: What steps should we take to help bridge this social, cultural, economic, educational and regional divide?

What are the limits of money when it comes to philanthropy?  
Hi Bill, what's the biggest 1st world problem you get? 
In your talk at Columbia University last month, you and Warren Buffet both emphasized the importance of “curiosity” as a personal quality. 

Do you believe curiosity is a trait that is naturally inherited or a trait that can be cultivated and strengthened? If the latter, what methods would you recommend for people to develop and stimulate their own curiosity?
Ok, Mr. Gates, what's a typical Bill sandwich consist of? I'm talking breads, meats, cheeses, condiments. if you could only have one sandwich on earth, what would it be?

Hi Mr. Gates! 

Thanks for doing this AMA! You are doing a lot of work eradicating diseases like Polio. In fact you've said that the diseases malaria and polio could be eradicated within the next 15 years, with polio gone as soon as 2019. I'd like to know which other deadly diseases that you think could be either 100% curable affordably or gone completely by 2050? 

And one more thing, you have said previously that you think AI can pose a serious threleat to humanity. I'd like to ask, apart from a killswitch, which other precautionary measures we could take to ensure that AI behaves well and doesn't wipe us out?,

Thanks a lot Mr. Gates! 
I have to know.. I saw what you got your secret Santa this year and it was amazing but what did YOU end up receiving?

Edit: Helpful Redditors answered my question below so thank you!! Follow up---- what did you think of it and what would you suggest to get you, if I were lucky enough to pull your name this year? 
What are your thoughts about the [recent announcement](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3173844/internet/fcc-reverses-net-neutrality-isp-transparency-rules.html) of the FCC overturning the net neutrality ISP transparency laws?
Why do you think our healthcare systems have such a hard time leveraging the revolutionary changes in scalability that we've seen in software?  Amazon is able to predict what we want, often before we realize we want it, but healthcare systems struggle to even schedule routine appointments and labs. 

Having worked on both the healthcare and tech sides, I think people underestimate just how big the differences are between the two fields, but I have a hard time saying who needs to bend more for us to reach a happy compromise.  Also, any idea on what we as concerned patients and family members can help to encourage this compromise?  I just feel like we're so close to using technology to improve efficiency and thus increase accessibility to care.    

Thanks for your time!
Did you copy Steve Jobs or did he copy you?
Mr. Gates!!!  

I was your Secret Santa recipient this year.  I know you more than likely saw my ridiculously long-winded thank you on RedditGifts, but I just wanted to say again how absolutely thankful I am for all of your wonderful gifts!  I just can't believe how much you absolutely nailed my personality, and every single gift was thoughtful and just perfectly aligned with my interests.

Hi Bill,

I'm going to become a father this summer.  Do you have any advice you wouldn't mind sharing, from one dad to a dad-to-be?

Thanks!
What do you think about Universal Basic Income?
How many iterations of your name did you have to go through until you found a username that wasn't taken?
Hi Bill and thanks for doing this. I recently read 2017 annual letter in response to Warren Buffet on the impact of his donation (2006) to your foundation, and the world it serves, and I thought the information you highlighted was incredibly powerful and insightful. For those of us that cannot start our own foundation, or even if we could, how do you recommend finding a cause worth fighting for? Clearly your access to information and resources has allowed you to isolate some of the world's larger problems and find those folks who can actually make a difference. But where did you start? (For those who haven't seen it- https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_14_2017_02_AL2017GFO_GF-GFO_&WT.tsrc=GFGFO)

Lastly, can I ask for your opinion on the status of the world refugee crisis. I've seen a lot of information on both sides of the fence, but I think I lean towards the belief that charity/donations need go into these communities and the folks that relocate are often the top thinkers/earners that could truly change their home country if they stayed. Here is a rather oversimplified video that summarizes the basis of my thoughts, I'd love to hear your view on all of this. (Poverty/refugee by numbers- https://youtu.be/LPjzfGChGlE)

Thanks again for taking the time. You truly are a visionary, role model, and hero without a cape to many of us worldwide.

Edit: formatting
Bill, big fan but I've got a question and I need you to formally settle it.

Is a hot dog a sandwich?
Bill, my father (Dr. William Halford) has developed a live attenuated vaccine for HSV-1 and HSV-2 that is not only preventative but can also reduce shedding (lowering transmission rates) and the frequency of outbreaks amongst those who already have it. Furthermore, people who have HSV-1 and HSV-2 are over 3x as likely to contract HIV. Currently, the regulatory nature of the FDA has created such high barriers to entry that only the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical players would be able to push through a vaccine (the approval process costs 100+M). However, with a 4B+ annual market in a drug called Valtrex (which only handles outbreaks but does not prevent transmission), the large players are not incentivized to create a cure or vaccine for HSV-1/HSV-2. Instead, they have been pushing subunit vaccines (viruses that are so heavily attenuated that the body is unable to produce a long lasting immune response; these failed trials centered around the same failed approach maintain their profits in drugs that keep those who suffer at bay rather than giving them a lifelong solution). Billions of people carry HSV-1/HSV-2 and tens of millions suffer from lifelong outbreaks. 

The company that the therapeutic/preventative vaccine is being tested under is called Rational Vaccines. They have recently conducted Phase 1 trials internationally and have seen profound results in the mitigation of symptoms in people with extreme cases of HSV-2.

Ultimately, a live attenuated HIV vaccine will likely be the path to eradication of the disease. This was the method employed for the polio and chickenpox vaccines. However, the attenuation of the polio, smallpox, chickenpox vaccines was random rather than by design, making it risky if the virus reverted to its original form..this resulted in the infection of 1 in ~100,000 vaccine recipients, but this was because the virus was attenuated in one site and would, in rare case, mutate back to its oringal Wild type form. My father's approach attenuates the HSV-1/HSV-2 viruses in multiple locations while still leaving it 99.7% intact. Since it is attenuated in multiple locations the odds of the virus reverting to its dangerous form are 1 in 100,000^3, meaning that practically no one who received his vaccine would be infected. The risk pales in comparison to the millions of people who contract HSV-1 and HSV-2 every year.

So Bill, is there a way that you could look into my father's work and help guide progress in the clinical trials/approval of the vaccine? Your foundation has the potential to make that impact.

Hi Bill, what makes you think like Elon Musk, Kurzweil…that  we are near a human level A.I ? and what laboratories, companies are the most advanced in this field ? 
What do you think about Elon Musk's comment on the necessity of universal basic income in the future due to unemployment caused by automation?
Mr. Gates,

What's your biggest flaw? I get asked this all the time in job interviews and it seems like a trap of a question.

Hi Bill! Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.

As a 26 year old Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who recently reentered the corporate sphere, what do you believe is the best way for me to contribute to the betterment of the world? After a significant period of time in East Africa I feel overwhelmed and deeply ill-equipped to find my footing in how I can help those in need. I'm continuously inspired by your and Melinda's work. Thank you for all that you do.

Hey Mr. Gates, any thoughts on the future of VR?
Hi there Mr. Gates! Just want to say, thank you for all of your philanthropy work. You have saved and improved so many people’s lives and are a constant inspiration to us all. <3

My friend and I were discussing global diseases the other day and how each of them are viewed and tackled.

You have chosen things like Malaria, Polio, and HIV to fight; all absolutely beautiful causes! 

My question is, what metrics do you use to tackle a disease? 

Full disclosure: both me and my friend have genital herpes, which is a silent epidemic that affects about 50 million in the US alone, and leaves you in a daily constant neurological pain with a fear of being ridiculed due to the stigma. 

Currently, doctors say there is no cure but most of us with the disease, believe there is but due to funding and FDA regulations we still have yet to find one. Companies like Rational Vaccines are on the verge of a cure right now (with live attenuated vaccine Theravax) , but again, are fighting US FDA regulations.

A second follow up question would be, vaccines in the US and their regulations. Has this been a hurdle for you getting them across the world? 

Thank you for your time and doing this AMA. The world needs more humans like you!


Hi Bill,

I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we appreciate your push of humanity to a brighter future through initiatives like the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.

I'm wondering if you have any intentions to divert time and/or resources towards the future of space and space exploration?
What phone do you use as your daily driver? iPhone, Google Pixel, Galaxy or Lumia?
Hi Mr. Gates, who was your role model when you were growing up?
Any advice on beating procrastination?

Hi Reddit. I'm Senator Bernie Sanders. I'll start answering questions at 2 p.m. ET. The most important election of our lives is coming up on Tuesday. I've been campaigning around the country for great progressive candidates. Now more than ever, we all have to get involved in the political process and vote. I look forward to answering your questions about the midterm election and what we can do to transform America.

Update: Let me thank all of you for joining us today and asking great questions. My plea is please get out and vote and bring your friends your family members and co-workers to the polls. We are now living under the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. We have got to end one-party rule in Washington and elect progressive governors and state officials. Let’s revitalize democracy. Let’s have a very large voter turnout on Tuesday. Let’s stand up and fight back.
In your opinion, what is the most pressing issue facing our generation today?

How will a single-payer healthcare system actually save Americans money? How is it that America is paying more per capita for healthcare relative to other developed nations that have implemented single-payer?
Thanks for this AMA.

How can we do better to combat disinformation? It's such a difficult thing, and the goalposts are ever-moving when it comes to "free-speech." How can we identify and combat blatant lies without violating constitutional rights? This is on my mind constantly, and I have no idea.

Hi Senator. What, if anything, can we expect the Democratic Party to do about student loan debt? 

Also, under Obama there were too many unemployment extensions given out. However, under Trump there are zero extensions being given. I am unemployed and am putting an overwhelming amount of effort into getting a new job. However, my unemployment is now up and I have yet to land a new position. Now I have barely any income on my part (I am married) and a 3 year old son to take care of. The nanny position I took while I am job searching in my field barely pays anything. Do you think it is possible that something could/will be done about the extensions? 
Hi Bernie,

I gleefully voted for you and strongly believe in your platform. However here in the Bay Area you have, a few times now, endorsed candidates for state office who strongly oppose policies to bring in new high density housing construction. (Specifically Jane Kim and Jovanka Beckles). Job growth has occurred rapidly here but construction of new housing has failed to meet that burden, and the result has been rapidly increasing rents and housing costs, with disastrous results for the working class.

With your endorsements, you've aligned yourself with candidates who support policies that will exacerbate this scarcity.

What is your position on urban housing development, and its role in housing affordability in areas with rapid job growth? Do you support higher residential density in urban areas with low carbon emissions and good public transit? Or should America continue its pattern of suburban sprawl and accompanying auto emissions and habitat loss? If you do support higher density, how do you reconcile that with your endorsements?
Hello Senator Sanders,

I was a huge supporter of yours in 2016 in my home state of Washington. I caucused for you, donated, and spread your message to all willing to listen. I was fortunate enough to attend your rally at the UW campus that year. It was magnificent!

One of the major reasons I supported you, apart from the obvious stuff (Medicare For All, Decriminalizing Cannabis, reigning in Corporate powers), was the fact that you largely have avoided pushing excessive gun control in your home state of Vermont.

As a racial minority who genuinely isn't sure whether or not I can trust Law Enforcement to protect me, I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, as well as the ownership of commonly owned rifles. I know "assault weapons" are a highly contentious point of political conflict, but I would hope that, as a nation, we could discuss the ramifications of reactionary gun laws and the unintended consequences they may have on the American people.

As you yourself witnessed during the Civil Rights Era, our laws tend to disproportionately impact specific groups, namely racial minorities and the poor. While I do greatly wish to see action taken to reduce gun violence, I have a hard time imagining how criminalizing the ownership of 50+ year old rifles will improve the already divisive nature of our country. Just like our drug laws, new gun laws will impact racial minorities and the poor before it affects those who *truly are* a threat to community safety.

My question is this: **What can I do, as a left-leaning liberal gun owner, to better highlight my concerns to a Politician willing to listen?** I've sent countless emails and letters to my local representatives, only to be brushed off as an "NRA Supporter" or something similar. I despise the NRA for a variety of reasons, and I'm not here to represent their misguided attempts at being true representatives of the American Rifleman. I want a serious dialogue with serious people who are willing to treat this issue with the respect it deserves.

Gun ownership is a right that belongs to ALL American people, and I fear that the polarity on this issue will result in further division when we *should* be coming together.

Thanks for the AMA!

Do you you think it is too late to "heal the divide' so to speak or have political parties in America become so at odds with each other that that common ground between the two will never be found?
Hello Senator,

I am Seattle resident, father, and full-time student. As an American citizen and voter I am concerned with the state and divide of our government. The two biggest issues, in my opinion, are bipartisanship and allocation of tax dollars. After that I would say it's dishonest campaigning. What would you recommend is the best solution that voters can impose to fix these issues? Seeing as we are constantly told there is no money for fixing our infrastructure, but we are paying tremendous taxes and many politicians have substantial salaries. And many of us want to get more diverse thinkers in Congress but are stuck with candidates that feel they need to vote with their party which is only one side or the other. 

I tend to vote democratic. Right now mostly to even out the two sides, but I don't always agree with just that side.

Btw I caucused for you in Seattle during the last primaries, but our electoral college representative didn't represent our votes. 

Sincerely, 
Daniel Vaughan
How will you pay for your proposed plans for universal healthcare and free college tuition?
Good afternoon Senator Sanders, 

I want to preface this first as I do not want this to be seen as a political afront against you. I have deep respect for you and even sat in the Senate gallery to watch you speak my first time in DC. Your work for working class and low-income individuals is renown. 

With that being said, I want to hear your views on a couple issues that I feel that you have misinformed. The first is: I want to know your reply to the argument that a national $15 minimum wage will increase the unemployment rate in economic regions where the equilibrium wage is below $15. More specifically, I want to know how you would combat unemployment due to small businesses, a large part of the suburban and rural American economy, not being able to cover labor costs? 

The second question I have for you is related to my past work in public housing. In many urban areas, there have been calls for rent controls or even limiting the boundaries of urban development to make housing affordable for those with low incomes. However, the result of this policy can lead to slumlords  and blight since the upkeep of an apartment/house above the rent control is not profitable. What is your approach to increase housing affordability and if it includes rent controls, what are you plans to combat blight and landlords that fail to provide and upkeep adequate amenities?
Senator, is it true you effectively got kicked out of a commune?
The [DNC is already discussing the 2020 primary debate schedule.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/413163-dems-hold-active-discussions-on-2020-debates)

How can we, as regular citizens, ensure that the 2020 debates will not be limited as they were in 2016? How can we make sure they're more small-d democratic and more focused on policy than the horse race or soap opera?
The world is on fire in pretty much every direction right now. What makes you hopeful?
Senator Sanders,

As a state level public defender I recognize there's not a whole lot that can reasonably be federally achieved with respect to ending mass incarceration given just how much of the problem originates in the state criminal system. 

However, a significant part of my client base is made up of two groups:

-noncitizens; and
-heroin addicts.

If Democrats take back Congress next week, do you have any plans to address and amend the INA to mitigate the immigration consequences of low-level criminal convictions, or pressure Trump to change current ICE deportation priorities?

If Democrats take back Congress next week, what do you think the federal government can do to encourage federal and state officials to deal with the heroin problem using a public health rather than a criminal justice approach? 

Finally, I have a number of concerns about the extent to which felony convictions result in disenfranchisement from a number of federal entitlements including and especially eligibility for low income housing benefits. What are you planning to do to dismantle these federal collateral consequences and prevent the growth of an already overlarge "criminal underclass" in the United States?

If we push for socialized healthcare and private corporations stop paying for advancements in medicine, who will take the mantel? Currently 80% of advancements come from private U.S. company's. Wouldn't that land on the American people increasing what we have to pay?

Hi Bernie!

What needs to be done to solve the issue of enormous and rising student loan debts that could potentially cripple our banking industry and crash our economy?
Where does all the money come from that you want to give everyone free healthcare and school?
How do you feel about the national debt? Is the solution taxation, inflation (which is effectively taxation), or cutting spending.  It's been a while since Congress has had the guts to balance the budget, much less run a significant surplus.  Many of your policies sound good (like free college), but they'd require more taxation or cuts to other parts of the budget.  
Hope I'm not too late to ask a question. 

So I've dug here and there around the internet, but was never able to find a solid answer.

Are you, or would you, ever consider running for president again?
Bernie,

Do you support a New Deal style jobs program? If so, what would it look like?
Thanks for doing this. My question...Why do you feel it necessary to take money from people who earned it and give it to people who haven’t? 
Hello Senator, 

a "democratic socialist" means someone who wants a country's means of production to be public and shared across all - basically no private companies. The only difference is that they want the country to become socialist democratically - aka via elections.

Going by your policies you sound more like a social democrat - someone who want privatization of car companies and fast food chains, but not things such as healthcare, prisons and so on.

&#x200B;

If you were to run in 2020, will you label yourself as a democratic socialist or a social democrat?
what is the best way to help create meaningful change on a local/city level? 
And if i had wheels, id be a wagon.... im sorry but listen to yourself...how much do those companies really need? Agreed they are greedy but they earned every cent as you sit and respond to me on your iphone...agreed they are greedy but they earned it, if you didnt buy it they wouldnt be so greedy but we wont go there..
have you ever read an economics book?
Hello Senator,

What are some changes to American healthcare that have not yet been pushed in Congress that you believe both sides can agree upon?
How are you going to evenly distribute the reddit coins you’ve received back to all of us, the working redditors?
This will be buried but it’s an honest question: people were worried about Reagan and his advanced age. I’m not calling you old per se, only asking a leader of America if he thinks he can make the long term commitments when he’s well past traditional retirement age. Senator Sanders: will you be able to conduct your campaigns and carry out your responsibilities for a minimum of eight more years? 
How did you become a millionaire off a senators salary? Do you realize that every time you talk about “millionaires and billionaires” ruining our country that includes you?
In specific numbers, how much will you have to raise income taxes (in each bracket) to pay for everything you want the government to do?
How did you pay for your houses on your paycheck as a politician?
Why havent you taken a basic economics class in the 80 or so years you've been alive? 
Hey Bernie! What are your thoughts on pushing for more worker cooperatives and worker self-directed enterprises? Do you think they can play vital role in the fight for a true democracy?
During the recession 10 years ago, schools in California had to shut down and shorten the school year with "furlough days" and that was WITH tuition. How are colleges going to stay functioning if/when we ever hit a recession if they are "free" like you are proposing? Where are these tax dollars going to come from if unemployment reaches 10%?
