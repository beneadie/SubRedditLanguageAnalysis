Animated Downvoting Roman Pony.

[deleted]
25th ranked in /r/all. The end is nigh.
Non-Brony here, That was quite good :D!
The only thing that I can think of is that it ought to start out as the neutral version of the two, and then transform.

[](/rdwut "But I am stoopud and can't remember her name")
[](/soawesome "thats amazing!") the transformation is so smooth.
monkeyjay doesn't always post... but when he does, he causes the entire subreddit to orgasm simultaneously.
I like this, its very smooth.  But I'll never get a chance to use it.

[](/party "I mean really, how often do you downvote here?")
holy shit, HOLY FUCK... you are the FISRT person to get 1k upvotes on r/mylittlepony
*sees post on All*

Wow, that's remarkably high up. Bet there's a lot of non-bronies commenting on it.

*clicks, watches gif*

Good gods, that was absolutely fantastic. This better be getting the upvotes it deserves...

*sees upvotes*

*sees monkeyjay's username*

Welp, that explains everything.

...

*upvotes*
Was inspired to pull out the original Karma flash and animate this. Inspired by the other downvoting ponies out there. I may do an upvote one with the same starting.

[](/twismile) This is really well done, the animation in particular is excellent, great work!

[](/sp)

[](/ppboring "Though I hope we won't get to use it too often...But if we do, well, we'll be downvoting in style, at least!")
[](/soawesome "I sense an entire library of original, fan-created MLP reaction GIFs finding their way onto my system in the near future...") 
Holy shit! We're on the frontpage of all!

If anything the eyes moved unnaturally slow. Just some constructive criticism.
Is her mane gonna turn blue? No...there's no way it could be that aweso --

THIS IS AWESOME
AND.... THE OPPOSITE?
I wish I had more upvotes!
I hope /r/mylittlesquidward put their spin on this.
holy shit your about to be the first person to get 1k up votes on r/MyLittlePony
[] (/nmm "Come to the dark side, we have poni.")
WOOOO! Front page pony post! [](/joy)
[](/allmybits "this is going to get huge in a hurry. Buckle up") This gets all my upvotes, and all my sidevotes.
Wait, so does that mean Karma and Descentia are the same pony?
I can maybe give y'all a pass on liking this show's animation, editing, etc, but seriously: what's with this profound love for a show so wholly directed to little girls?  I'm genuinely weirded out here.  It's so effeminate and puerile.
It's shit like this that keeps me from hating ponies.
Holy fuck this is fantastic!!!

I'm going to be using this ***a lot***
This is good
Can you make the reverse?

This community is so awesome that it finally gets to the downvoting ropony, and he starts upvoting EVERYTHING!
Love it
This gif is marvelous.
This is really awesome! Good Job!!
[](/b21) + 800 upvotes in 5 hours... My god.
[](/joy "1k votes!?")

[](/ohhi"Hey! Do you know what this calls for? Go on. Guess.")
[](/rdwut"Awesome~~~~") 
Wow. This is nothing short of awesome.
Somehow I read that as Automated Downvoting Roman Pony at first.
[Fun historical fact](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35llls/)
Wow , I LOVE LOVE LOVE the hair.  So vibrant, such a smooth cross in the colors.  Awesome.
[](/wahaha) Absolutely brilliant.
Already said a few times, can't say it enough.  This is fantastic and love it!
edit: I was just a weee bit enthusiastic and double posted. [](/lunateehee)

[So here's a video, in case you somehow haven't managed to see it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfZTr8zMsc)
Downvote.... pony?


What possible use could this have? Is it some sort of sarcastic portrait of what might happen if the friendship and love ran out?
Monkeyjay is back..... with presents!
Veni, Vidi, Vici indeed.

BAH GAWD

EDIT: This is now on Reddit's front page. Oh lawdy.
It's reaching critical mass...
I fucking love it.
I can't stop watching this O_o
[](/fluttershh)I thought she was playing with an invisible toy airplane the first few seconds.
This post is ironic because I just uphoofed it.
Wow! That is really neat!! :D

Something weird happened with mine the first time I clicked it though. Instead of having the orangered colored hair and eyes, she was grey, then turned to blue! D: It was very weird....
[deleted]
Guys. Hey. Hey guys. [](/c11)

It's hard for me but, guys.

This post has four digits in upvotes. Four digits! That's like twice the two we are usually used to. 
<3
I like how the ending is well animated, bobble bounce and all. Something needs to be done about its eyes in the beginning though.     
But seriously, what the fuck is with all these ponies?
that is awesome! NICELY DONE!!
I congratulate you for having the first post to get more than 1000 upvotes in the subreddit! [](/bonbon) 
Mein got.
For something the represents downvotes, it sure is getting a lot of approval.
The top post in our top post?  A comment about our top post being a top post.

Ah, buck it.  monkeyjay, you rule.  /r/mylittlepony, you rock.

[](/rdhappy "And since you didn't bother posting during work, your comment is confined to the bottom of the comment dungeon")
[] (/dealwithit) So much win.
Frontpage aww yee!
I'm going to [/r/new](/r/new) to use that :D
I gave him upvote #1111. doublesguy.jpeg
I will ironically upvote it.
yeah, it couldnt be Julius Caesar it had to be a pony...
Amazing monkeyjay! What did we get up to on r/all ? I can't believe I missed it.
[](/sbstare "When he downvotes, I hear the Inception "BWAAAAH" play. Every time.")
Don't even need to save this. It's made the top post of the entire sub. Now that you have reached this accomplishment, what are you going to do next?
Downvote. Hey, just following orders.
Ok... I don't understand this, I...I'm just going to block this subreddit now from r/all... 
Roman pony animating its own demise. 
Seriously i have to see this pony bullshit on the frontpage now? Are you fucking kidding me?
the only good thing to come out of /r/mylittlepony. ever.
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS A TOP 10 POST

WHAT THE FUCK HAS GONE WRONG WITH REDDIT
[deleted]
i just found this

and wtf

im 12

i before internets
For all the years, memories, and laughs.

It feels strange, 9 years of something ending. How different some of our lives were when this show started, and how incredible a show that was just a product placement became. I rarely get around to drawing ponies, but I absolutely loved this show, and a lot of the community creations that came with it. I hope this is a fitting, wholesome homage to this series and fandom. Wouldn't say I've been active at all in it, but I've always been appreciative. OC, first time trying to draw Twi as well.

Enjoy, I hope!

Edit: thank you all for the kind words! Im glad it was well recieved
Hey don’t cry we have a gen 5 and a new movie coming in the next year or so. So pls don’t cry or I’ll cry 😭
It started with a book... And now it ended with a book... Luv u twilight sparkle
I know it's silly but it hurts.
I'm just imagining a montage of stills / GIFs from all the episodes, shown in synchronized order from first to last, while something like Head Above Water plays as the background tune. After that, it slowly fades to this drawing
[](/smolder)Although there are other things in life that have had a bigger impact on me than MLP, there's certainly no other show or film or other entertainment media that has had such a significant and lasting influence on my life. That much is never going to be taken away.
You've come far princess pancake
[](/a03) 🎵Traveled down a road and back again🎵
Oh god, my feels. MLP has meant so much to so many people. Always remember, we aren't going anywhere!
I have to leave for work soon, don't make me cry. :(
I am crying 😭
I keep holding it together then I remember and come crashing down again.
Thank you Twillight, Princess of friendship. Thank you for all these years !
Jesus. To think its been 9 whole years. I was 9 when this came out and I started watching it. Now I'm 18, just finished high school, and starting college/career training and have a boyfriend. So much in my life has changed and i never thought ponies would be such a big part if it. Its crazy what time does to a person. I love absolutely everything that came out of this show. The friends I made over Discord alone are enough to last forever. I love you all, and I couldn't wish for a more amazing community if I tried. Thank you for 9 amazing years.
this is a cool one, very emotional
You are absolutely welcome.
This sub gonna make me start taking antidepressants :P
I still can't bring myself to watch the final season.
[](/twisad) And thank you for being a great friend, through on through.
great, now im crying again
I'm curious to what Gen 5 will offer. Hopefully the Gen 4 characters are still around but aren't the main characters.
This should be the most upvoted post in r/mylittlepony history, only 700 to go!
I know this probably going to sound weird from someone who doesn’t really engage in this community or this show  but can definitely feel for this and how sad it is to see a series end. I also have been shown some interested in mlp, not enough to dive completely into it but I tried watching a some episodes and it is nice. Even the people in this fandom seem nice for the most part. I have even seen work as good as this by many other people.
The last thing I wanna say is good luck in the future and good bye G4 mlp.

I also wanted to drop by because it feels weird have it end and it has been nagging me for sometime
It's beautiful i love how the book closed amazing artwork. Twilight is happy in tears like us. Imma go be sad now lol
I might just cry. This show had a good run though. It still means so much to me
The finale actually made me feel happy. I haven't felt that in a while. I stopped watching the show a while ago, around season 6, but it was really nice to watch through some of it again. It's good to see the characters I watched when I was younger grow up. I guess its fulfilling to see. I dont get that a lot. I guess it's the closure.
["Thank you, and goodbye, my friends..."](https://youtu.be/60as5quUKJQ?t=230)
So this is it, huh? Crazy how long it lasted, had some great moments with this series.
Thanks for posting your beautiful artwork, and congrats on the #8 top scoring thread on r/mylittlepony.
(pours out cider)
Just got back into the show after a pretty long hiatus. Can't believe it ended
Wow! This is really good!
I'm honestly quite concerned I might end myself when G4 officially ends

I don't really have anything else joyful in my life
Awe, what an adorable and heartwarming image. <3
K no cry not today
Plot twist: The whole show was Twilight reading a book.
Here, have an updoot for cootness
The ride never ends
I keep thinking back to Time Adventure when considering the ending of MLP, even moreso than I do regarding the ending of Adventure Time itself. I find myself coming back to one lyric in particular. 

"You and I will always be best friends." 

That's how I feel about this show ending.
I just started to get out of my anonymous form of spectating the fandom...just when the show is ending

Guess i came too late to the party ;;
Beautiful
/)#(\ brony for life 🌈
😭😭😭😭
No, thank you.
Reddit just made it possible to comment on formerly archived posts it seems? Neat, so now I can tell you how this post somehow reaching r/popular is part of what made me an MLP fan. Very nice.
Hey everyone! Reddit has broke the Archive rule so I’m here to remember…thanks for everything
Wake up!

*That moment when you’re the human protagonist in an MLP fanfiction*
[](/derp) It's O.K.

I'm just a bit derpyer than usual.

I'll wash up and get dressed.
POV: You just join them to equestria (good ending)
Okay, I can deal wi- HOLY *BLEEP* I’M A *BLEEP*ING PONY
I gotta remember to take my medication
If only
Grab a brush and put a little make up.
This is ACCEPTABLE.

But it really depends, am I a Unicorn, Pony, or a Pegasus.

Also, am I actually adorable?

I would actually want to be a unicorn, they can be ultimate wizards!
Does this mean I’m Spike?
Oh how grand, we're going to the gala!
I would ask where I was first and if I was dreaming then if I wasn’t dreaming I would put on a tux for the gala that rarity made for me
The first thing I'm gonna ask is:

"How long was I out?"
Hey, you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?
i would want to wake up like this everyday
Plot twist: it could be EaW or FoE timeline.
Wake me up please

Wake me up!
PLEASE TAKE ME.
I wished
Aw, don't make me cry like this.
No! Not the Gala!
Wait...  by that POV, does this mean I'm Spike?
\*Sobbing\* Yes! Take me home!
Am I a unicorn? I want to be a wizard.

Jeez, real life is fucked.
That Twily smile!
\*shivers\* too real

I award this a song about returning to fantasy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00f2kSnIxfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00f2kSnIxfw)

  
*Get it back*  
*Get nowhere*  
*Get it right*  
*Follow my heart*  
*Back to, back to Oz*
Hallelujah
I wish I could experience it never to return
I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN SO BADLY...
It is………





ACCEPTABLE
\-- The Gala? Really?

\-- Heheh, jes' messin' wit'ya, partner! Now get back to work, dem apple trees ain't gonna buck themselves.
Ah, this makes me so happy.

Seriously, in a single meme, you have captured everything that *My Little Pony* means to me. It's like you saw into the depths of my soul.
Hell yeah I'd go to the Gala with them
What I wouldn’t give to be there to watch the gala episode when it first streamed again 😭😭
(Sigh) I knew I should've taken my medicine
When the edibles ain't shit
Ah! AH! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
We cannot depend on miracles, my darlings. We must bring equestria to us<3
*When the shrooms hit*
man… i wish…
This mildly implies I'm Spike.

Which is fine, really. 'Butler to a nerdy royal' doesn't sound like the worst job ever.
I wish
Wake up bro it's 2011!
The council will decide your fate.
Connection terminated.  
I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.  
You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.  
But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.  
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.  
This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.  
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.  
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.  
I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.  
It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.  
This ends for all of us.  
End communication.
As long as I'm a unicorn...
If only, girls. If only.
\*Then I blink and found myself in the backrooms
So I assume that I’ve become Spike after a sudden fall. Dear Celestia…
Yess
I'd be confused but happy
Damn... we seem to forget how really great 2013 was
Well imma do what I do
Ok but quick question 
What kind of pony am I?

Earth pony?

Unicorn?

Pegasus?
I can't remember anything from my pony life
Wait what is my cutie mark?
Don't tease me like this. 😭
This is like every brony’s fantasy, and I hate it
"Wait... You're... Oh No. My wife. My Kids! Where's my Family! What have you done with them!?"
if i look like my OC then I would definitely be happy here, at least for a little bit until I realise what job I have.

unfortunately it's gonna take a lot more than magic and pony cuddles to get rid of my depression 😅
Oh goddamnit, I'm Spike!
I just had a terrible thought, what if this is a dream?
Alright, somebody get me a gun.
If only if only
Please tell me I get to be friends with Discord!
i wish
Me:I don’t know I got here but I think I died
;w;
Congrats on 1k upvotes!
[deleted]
I would love to wake up to this! :D
An MLP Isekai?
Kinda reminds me of this comic:   [My Little Sterelis](https://www.deviantart.com/jadedjynx/art/My-Little-Sterelis-410995983)
All these people talking about being a human in a fanfic when it's easier to say that you just woke up as Spike.
I think this implies you’re Spike
Congratulations!

You definitely nailed the second spot for the top memes on this sub!

And this one is the most recent one!
Am I Spike?
It's like, guys, grow a pair?
Woke
This is how Friendship with [REDACTED] 2 starts, isn't it?
Cool I live here
Why is Rarity staring like that?
That would be awesome. Imagine being able to visit Equestria whenever you wanted.
Gala or no gala, TAKE ME WITH YOU!
Ponysssss
Rarity could get me to eat one of my own fingers with those bedroom eyes of hers.
No...don't give me hope! 😭
No thanks. I want to kep my heart rate higher than 50 bpm
I'm going to the Grand Galloping Gala!!!!!!
Pony fucking pokey yeaaa babyyyy
Who's Putin? What's debt? The dream.
I truly hope all of you get the help you need.
This would actually make me so happy. Life is just too stressful in general. I wanna wake up in Equestria with the girls and just relax.
god, I wish
Oh shoot, looks like it's time for another existential crisis.
what is a pandamic
Only if...
It’s a quantum flow… so it do be like that.
Plot twist you’re in a RGRE story
*Panemic
When the shrooms kick in
[PLEASE READ THE RULES BELOW!]

I'm gonna make a fanfic of this, you are still human, a 13 year old kid who had gone through depression recently and your halfway there. You wake up like this, you had dreams like this, so you  think this is a dream too. You are allowed to make parralel universes wherever you want. If 2 scenarios happen if a reply thing, you have to keep it going by making that other reply one of the parralel universes. Sus things are not allowed. The kids name is Jeffrey, now for the beggining. 
 
You are also allowed to crash parralel universes on each other of it starts getting insane. Time travel is allowed.

Jeffrey: ugh... it was all a dream...? Oh thank God it was all a dream, who are you guys, where am I, and how did I get here...?
It's like every "Hey you, you're finally awake" meme, but much better than all of them combined.
If this is a Dream then don’t wake me up
omg am i my ponysona?
Wake up!
Tell me that you are not addicted while seeing this
This is what gets us cheered up during hard times :)
I know where this is going
Unable to watch the S3 premier and probably never will, but I would still like to say thank you for this amazing ride.
**EDIT: I can understand why people don't believe this, and I don't really care. I understand it's the internet and you don't beleive everything you read, fine by me. But do you really think you know a person just from a few comments they made? Stop deluding yourselves. If I wanted internet points, I would have posted her pictures or her hospital room filled with MLP merchandise. I'm not going to provide proof. I'm not going to fall to your level.**

**EDIT: Thank you for your kind words everyone. I just got back from work and decided to check this and it has over 200 comments. I'm at a loss for words. I might not be able to reply to all of them, but I promise you I'll read them all. Thank you everyone.**

Hello Reddit. I still haven't watched the Season 3 premier. A reason for this is because a friend of mine, we would watch each episode together religiously, passed away on Friday. I knew she was very sick and she didn't have much time left but she still promised to watch the premier with me. She couldn't fulfill that promise.

Today, I got an email from her sister and with her permission I would like to share it with you guys.

>Dear Adrian,
>
>First off I want to say that spending time with you has been a blast. Ever since you introduced me to MLP:FiM I was able to endure the long and boring nights in the hospital. Thank you for that. Every week I would be so excited when a new episode comes out that I could hardly fall asleep. It was also partly because you would come and see me. The doctors said it was bad for me, but I couldn't help myself. I didn't tell you this because I knew you would stop coming, but I knew that being curled up next to you while we watch MLP was the best medicine that no doctor can give.
>
>When you first told me about it I was skeptical. I mean, come on, it's ponies, but it seems like you really enjoyed it so I gave it a try. After the first few episodes I was hooked too. The smile you gave me when I admitted that I loved the show made me smile too. We both found solace from this show. Cancer for me and depression for you. I guess you could say we complete each other, like how two broken pieces can create a whole even if it is mismatched. I knew it wouldn't last long though. We were near the end of Season 2 and there were no more episodes left. I felt sad that it was over. Watching the show gave me an escape from reality and it was over. I wanted to tell you to come back the next day but I didn't, I didn't want to come off as someone selfish. But I didn't have to; you came back the next day too. You showed me Reddit's r/mylittlepony. I enjoyed their drawings and the community; you gave me back the magic. You even showed me FiMFiction for stories the fan wrote.
>
>You kept coming back again and again, showing me new MLP stuff. Your drawings and even reading some of your own stories. You even offered to rewatch the series again, and I said yes. Truthfully though, the second time we watched it, I wasn't even watching. I just wanted to be near you, to see your face, to feel your warmth. Sometimes I would pretend to fall asleep so that you would put your arms around me. Or I would quietly sneak glances in the corner of my eye to memorize your face. And no matter what people say, you're beautiful. I never got the courage to tell you that, but you were braver than me. You would tell me things all the time. Things that made my day better.
>
>You would tell me that I looked beautiful even though I had tubes coming out of me. You would tell me I'm going to be fine even though we both know I won't. You would tell me that you were always going to be here for me even though that's impossible. You would tell me that my drawings and stories were good even though it couldn't compare to yours. You would tell me that Rarity is the best pony, even though Applejack is the best.
>
>You would tell me all of these things, but you never told me what I want to hear the most. You didn't love me, at least not the way I love you. I thought I was over you but you kept coming back. I never told you this in person so I'll write it.
>
>I love you. I really, really love you. So, so much. I never stopped loving you. When you rejected me back in high school I was hurt and tried to get over it, but I guess I didn't. I knew you didn't see me like that, but I could. And it didn't stop me from loving you. It might sound creepy but I learned a lot about you. I knew you had a rough childhood. I knew why you didn't have any friends. I knew that you hide behind your smile. I knew why you have that scar on your face. I knew all these things but I still love you.
>
>I'm going to miss our weekly discussion. I'm going to miss our small arguments on who's the best pony. I'm going to miss your drawings. I'm going to miss your stories. I'm going to miss you. I can't say it enough, but I'll miss you. 
>
>I wish that I wasn't sick. I wish that I could grow old. I wish that I could start a family. I wish that I could introduce my kids to the show. I wish that you could stay here by my side, watching our favourite show together, forever.
>
>I know I promised to watch the Season 3 premier with you, but I honestly think I won't make it. So I want you to have something. My Applejack plushie. I want you to take it with you whenever you watch an episode, so I can be with you. Remember to make those comments that I love hearing on each episode. Pretend that whenever you talk to Applejack, you're talking to me.
>
>There are a lot of things I want to tell you but I won't have enough time. There is one though that you should know. I hope you beat your depression. I won’t be able to beat my cancer, I know that and you do too.  But maybe you can beat your illness. I know you can. Every time we watch an episode, I wouldn't focus on the show at all. I would just look at you, and I can see that you truly enjoyed it. Use it to find a new meaning in life. Be a new person, go out, and make new friends that will understand you. You can do it. You were able to help me through a rough time and I can't repay you but just give you my words and I hope it's enough.
>
>Lastly I want to end this letter just like the letters the mane six write at the end of every episode. I guess you could say this is my last episode so it seems appropriate. So here's what I learned:
>
>That friendship truly is magic.
>
>Your best friend,
>
>Lisa

She loved to browse r/mlp just as much as she loved watching the show. I want to say thank you for everything. From your drawings, your stories, even the weekly discussion. Thank you.

I still can't watch S3 because it still hurts, but when I do, I'll have my Applejack plushie with me. Once again, thank you.

[](/rdcry) My condolences and my best wishes. 

She sounds like she wanted you to go on, and watch the show so that you would remember her. You might not be able to right now because it hurts, but the worst you could do would be to give up the good memories you had with her and try to erase them. With time, you will come to mostly remember and cherish the good moments. But it takes time, lot of it.

Protect that memento she gave you, because it's far more then most people will ever manage in their lives.
You should honestly consider sending this to Faust, she already knows what a special fanbase she has, but this is on another level...and its wonderful!
I'm sorry for your loss. I'm crying just from reading this letter, but I hope things get better for you soon. It doesn't sound like you came here for consolation, but when I read something like:

>being curled up next to you while we watch MLP was the best medicine that no doctor can give.

Just know you went the extra mile for her, and gave her something very, very special in her last days - companionship in a very lonely and difficult situation. We should all be so lucky to have you as a friend.
My condolences on the lost friend. Since no one esle has plugged it I'm sure that if you need support the redditors over at /r/mylittlesupportgroup would be more than willing to help you out. It may be too painful to watch now but someday (I don't know when) the good memories will outshine the pain and watching the episodes will remind you of the happiness you brought her.  

im so sorry for your loss. i know my words dont mean much, and this may be a little selfish, but i wish i had a freind who cared about me as she cared about you. you should be greatfull for the time you got to spend with her. reflect on all the good times you had with her. she would want you watch the rest. the rest of this post sums up how i feel after reading this.

I wish I could help you, but the only thing I can say is that we'll be here for you no matter what.


I lost all composure at the part about the Applejack plushie... You have my condolences, Adween. I do hope you can still share the same joy for ponies in due time. You two really have something special, I am so sorry you had it taken away from you...
She's in a far better place right now. I may sound like an idiot but she's in Equestria, so she could watch you watching her, if you see a new pony in the background that's her.
It takes a lot to make me tear up, especially stuff on the internet, but this....

I don't really know what to say apart from I'm sorry for your loss and I hope you get the support you need during this sad time.

Its great that you had those special moments, and I'm grateful you shared this with us.
[](/ajsad)What a very touching letter. A shame she had to pass like that. 

My condolences to her family, her friends and you. I hope you can get through your depression, as she hoped you will do. Losing someone close is a very bad time in everyone's life, and we all are going to experience it some time. And the best way to cope with it, is to be open about it.

Remember that we are always here for you if you want to talk about something, we'll listen.

[](/aj20)
That is the saddest thing I have read in a long while. All of my feels. I know it sounds empty coming from a random internet commentator, but I really do feel for you, and you have my deepest condolences and best wishes.

If I were you, I'd watch it with that plushie. And pour a drink out for Lisa while you do so, she sounds like she was a great friend, truly one in a million.

Requiescat in pace.

I agree that you should send this to Faust. Let her know how much of an impact she's made on you and your friend's lives.  I am also very sorry for what happened to your friend. I am like you, in a way, but with the shoes switched. My friend introduced me to mlp just as you did to her, but he is the one with cancer. I think he can beat it, but i understand how you feel. You always have another family here in this community so just know that.
tears 

tears everywhere

*hugs*
Wow, I'm so sorry for you and your loss, I'm reading this at work while my lips are trembling and eyes are twitching, trying to hold back tears for myself. Seems like a wonderful person, as are you for making her so comforted in her time of need, and making her feel special in the time she had left. It's such a shame that it happened on Friday too, before she was able to enjoy the premier with you. Keep AJ with you, for her! I know the community will agree with me when I say, stay strong and beat your depression, for her. :)

Edit: whoever downvoted this post...you're a dick!
Good sir, you are I'm my thoughts and prayers. The joy you placed into 1 persons life is more than others will in a lifetime. I'm still a fairly new brony, but I feel this one letter shows what it truly means to be one. If there is anything you need do not hesitate to ask. Keep strong, and I hope to see you back soon.
[](/raritysad)I'm truly sorry for your loss my friend.  If you ever need to talk about it, or anything for that matter, feel free to send me a private message, I'm always available

[](/sp)Your friend seems to have wanted you to go on, for both of you.  You both found joy in something, and that something brought you together.  It made the time she had left the best time of her life.  You should feel proud and honored by that.  You truly were an amazing friend to her.

And that memento of hers, that's something truly amazing.  Keep it by your side and always remember something for me.  No one is ever truly gone.  They continue to affect the world in ways we cannot imagine.  As long as you never forget Lisa, then she's never really gone.  When you finally do watch the new season, if you ever do, do it for her.  In her memory have the time of your life.  It is not the job of the living to mourn the dead.  It is our job to celebrate them, their lives and legacies.  

People are amazing things, wonderful, beautiful things.  We have so much brilliance and ingenuity.  We can do anything we set our minds to, we can unlock the mysteries of the universe.  And we mourn.  But we can hold on to people, even those who are no longer here.  In that way, they continue to live, in hearts and minds.  

So go ahead, watch the episode, and let it remind you of a wonderful life.  Someone who you were so close to, let this thing that brought you together remind you of them forever.  And as you watch it, think of her, think of all the times you shared, and all the joy you had.  And smile, because you made her happy.

As the wise man Theodor Seuss Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss once said: "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."

So don't cry because Lisa is gone, hold your head higher, and smile wider because of her memory, and because of the times you shared.

Smile because she happened.
I wish I could award you 1,000 upvotes, even though self posts don't give you karma. My condolences to you, her, and her family. I'm literally on the merge of crying. Hope you do overcome your depression. I guess ponies help in the most serious events. 
I just read this while at work and almost burst out crying. Please stay strong and im sorry for your loss
I could feel the love leaking through the letter just as tears were leaking out of my eyes. I don't know you. I will probably never meet you. But I really, really want to hug you more than anything right now.
First time in a year and a half that I’ve teared up over anything. I am so sorry for you, and Lisa’s family.

Looks like She still wanted you to watch those episodes, though, so do it for Her, when you’re ready. Heck, just believe that’s She’s with you, and She’ll be with you when you watch them.

Just remember that you made Her happy, with every single minute you spent with Her. Don’t fret over what could’ve been, because the time that you two spent together *was* the best it could’ve been.

So beat depression into the ground, and be happy for Her.

And take damn good care of that Applejack plushie, y’hear?
I think I will have to get back to this thread later after I stop crying.

Fuck.

Fight on, my friend. Memories are powerful, never give them up. Fight for tomorrow. Fight for Lisa.
I've never cried from a Reddit post until today.  My heart goes out to you
Sweet Celestia.  

I can't begin to understand your pain, but I would think that MLP is a very special bond between you two.  Wouldn't continuing to watch the show and love the series be a remembrance to the special bond the two of you shared?

The hole in your heart may never completely close, but by embracing what brought the two of you joy, you can help mask it.

> I want you to take it with you whenever you watch an episode, so I can be with you.

She even said it herself.  She wants to be with you in spirit even in death.

Again, it's not my place to tell you what you should do, but I don't think giving it up is what she had in mind.  What I'd like to say, I have no right to say, so I'd ask that you'd reconsider it.  Watch the series to completion, participate in the fandom, and keep her (AppleJack) close by your side.  I'm not saying be a lifelong diehard brony, but I think she'd want you to experience the joy of the series while it is still in production.  

I had to close the door to my office and dry my eyes, and my heart goes out to you. 

Edit:  For the sake of closure to my comment, I typically listen to 5-10 hour mixes on youtube.  As it so happened, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obLjRmk8300) was playing when I read the letter.  It made the letter even more painful to read.  Either by sheer coincidence, or by fate, it made it even more difficult to read with any sort of composure.    

Edit 2:  I just realized the insensitivity of the artist's name in this situation, but I think the song outweighs the negative connotations of the name. 
I keep thinking that if my fellow brony best friend died, I don't know if I could handle it. I'm crying just imagining your pain and remembering the pain I've felt losing too many people. Everyone handles these things differently, even if I had advice to give I don't think it'd be my place to do so. Just know that you had something so special, and that you can make it live on for the rest of your life. 

Celestia bless you <3
[](/raritydaww)I'm very sorry for your loss and my thoughts are with you and Lisa's family. From her letter your friend sounds amazing, and it's always hard to lose someone even if you knew it was coming for awhile. 

[](/twipride)Give yourself time - grief takes awhile. The show and the community will still be around when you're ready. 
I'm sorry about your friend, I hope she's happy wherever she is now.

Good luck with your depression and moving on, I think we can most of us here agree in saying we're here if you need help. I suffer depression as well, so I understand. Losing a friend certainly doesn't help that. Just keep hope that someday you will see her again.

And hey, if heaven really exists and is perfect, maybe we Bronies will go to Equestria.

You and your friend have my thoughts and love. If you ever need anything, don't feel shy about dropping me a message, even just for someone to talk at.
Dude... I just want to hug you right now... [](/macintears)

This is truly touching... I agree with Canon. Send this to Faust. Let her know how much this show and fandom has helped people, and how it touches them dearly. Hell, let the entirety of the staff of the Hub, Studio B, etc. know how much their work means to us. It's the least we could do after they've brought such joy and friendship to the world, even during difficult circumstances such as yours.
Do you know if her parents need any financial help, for themselves or for a charity in her honor? Because you have a community here who will go above and beyond the call of duty to help you and her and her family.

You are a great, great friend. My tears and condolences are yours...
I started crying at work. Holy crap. 
I know this probably doesn't mean much coming from a random internet stranger but I'm so sorry for your loss. Your friend sounded like a wonderful person and I choked up reading this. She's in a better place now and I hope just like she hoped, that you can overcome your depression. Stay strong and don't let your depression consume you. For not just her sake but your own you sound like a great friend.
i don't know what to say, i'm sorry for your loss. hope you can look back on this in a few years and just remember the good times you had together. good luck <3
You're a good person, I am truly sorry for your loss.
>I love you. I really, really love you. So, so much. I never stopped loving you.

I started bawling at this point :(

My condolences to you and her family.

I have never been moved by a reddit post as much as I have been moved by this one. I honestly cried a bit. You are a great person. Much better than I am or possibly ever will be. 

For the first time in the history of the internet, [this](http://cdn.head-fi.org/2/2c/2cda10c2_slow-clap.gif) is completely necessary.
Just a few moments ago, I was reading something on reddit about reasons you get up in the morning. Reading stories of love like this is for sure one of the top things. Thanks for making me glad to get up this morning. May your friend's love carry you through this. Cadence would be proud. 
Bro, She may not be here anymore, but you got to watch the Season Premier with that Plushie. She wants you to, you not doing it would mean all of those vists were nothing, and dude you know that's not true, If you felt the same way, you do what she said, Beat your Depression and watch Ponies with her, as Applejack.
> I love you. I really, really love you. So, so much. I never stopped loving you. When you rejected me back in high school I was hurt and tried to get over it, but I guess I didn't.

Pony tears were shed in colossal amounts
I am so sorry for your loss. I know the immense pain you must be in. Cancer sucks, hard. No one should ever have to go down that road, but she did, and she went as a trooper. Everybody is destined to die. There is nothing you can do to stop that. The only way to live on this earth after certain death is to have your legacy carried on. Carry on her legacy. Do not contain your feelings in a bottle, and shove your memories in a box. That bottle is garunteed to burst, and it is better to pour your feelings out yourself, than have them shatter out on their own accord. Forgetting her won't bring her back, don't avoid the pain, embrace it. Acknowledge all the great times you had, and bring her with you every time you watch MLP, because that is all you have left of her. Of all that yyou shared remember that, as it is what carries her legacy. That Applejack plush is not just some felt and stuffing, it is Lisa's legacy. I Internet send you my condolences and prayers. I am truly sorry for you. Although it my hurt, it is better for you to shed all those tears, than leave them inside to rot. Once you can gather the strength, watch the S3 premier of MLP, and don't focus on the lack of her presence, fill in that gap with the memories you cherished. You are her only hope that she may live on in this world, carry her legacy.
I'm sitting in a Biggby Coffee right now waiting for some friends, and I'm trying hard not to break down and cry here in this public space.  That is truly moving.  I mean not to push any beliefs onto you, should you be a Christian or not, but I hope I get the chance to someday meet your friend in Heaven.  I'm sorry that you have lost someone near and dear to you, but I hope healing comes.  God bless you.
This is way more sad the my little dashie. I don't think anything can compare to that. My sincerest condolences.  
[](/celestia) Well, now I'm inspired to go be more active on r/bipolar again.
[](/raritydaww) Dude you are the best person ever. You made her final moments happy, prevented her from spending her last breaths alone in a boring hospital awaiting the inevitable.

You are an amazing person, you should cherish those moments and continue to watch the show, for her.
[](/macintears)..

 i really doenst know what to say, but i know what you feeling.. and know been a brony is never been alone!

and always remeber.. she is wright.. Rarity is amazing. but Applejack is the best pony!


Wow, that really hit me deep. It was really sad, but it was also sort of wonderful, too, that she could be so optimistic in the future even in the face of death. Especially your future! I don't think that I could ever be that brave. I hope that, one day, her kind words and your shared interest in MLP will be a source of solace, and not one of pain.

[](/rdhug)Remember that if you ever need anyone to talk to, we'll be here for you, especially in /r/mylittlesupportgroup.
Damn... I'm a living waterfall. God that was deep as hell.. Man keep on walking! I want to write something but can't really come up with something! That's real friendship right there! */] brohoof man!
Take Care!
Oh man, I'm crying throughout this whole thing. I'm so, so sorry for your loss, she seemed like an amazing person and you do to. I wish you the best in life.
[](/raritysad) My condolences, and my hope for a better future.

I would love to add more, but what I would say has already been said many times in this thread. My best wishes to your future

Also, something which I hope will help: /r/MyLittleSupportGroup 
[](/macintears "Those feels...") That has managed to warm even my sometimes very cold /b/-tard heart. I am so sorry Adrian, you have deepest condolences. I hope you will manage to overcome your loss and your depression and ultimately find your way back in life. Lisa will always stay with you in your memories, the people we love never really go away. I wish you well and hope you will eventually be able to move on and once again be able to look at the bright side of life. All is not lost.
Okay, I'm the type of person who usually openly questions the actual existence of things like this, very likely blaming the OP for trying to gather karma and attention. 

But, no. Not this time. I visibly **cracked** someplace near the middle. I'm quite pragmatic, a bit cold, admittedly, with a very dark outlook on whatever activities other undertake, and I **cracked**. This can't not be true; it is. Even technically, the letter can't fall under my definition of fake - maybe because of how it's structures, maybe due to the nature of sentences... Doesn't matter.

Right now I am at the point of having a small seizure from trying to hold back whatever it is trying to punch through my tear ducts. That... I've hardly ever felt that. 

And the letter itself, it... I can probably say that it somehow managed to make everything a bit better. For me, strangely. No, really. I remember being increasingly anxious every time a new episode would come out, and having trouble browsing this subreddit even - various reasons, quite some of them. As a matter of fact, sometimes I'd be annoyed with the characters, sometimes with myself, and all in all my being a fan of MLP was a bit screwed up and not right lately. Now, however... I feel different. Subtly, yes, but, well, if I'm writing about it I'm probably either blankly reassuring myself or actually am feeling it. There's something different about it, like if a jigsaw piece was picked up from the floor to replace the one that kind of looks like the needed one but the angle's different and it's red and not white.

I am glad that at the end of the day, she had someone to eventually bring her peace. This might seem like a hard burden, but the lack of it could have probably been much worse. 

And good luck with your depression. I adore your ability to be able to keep and actually have someone there to like you and spend time with them when it's most important. Coming from someone with a rather tragic amount of personal experience, that should be signal of your own condition being, in the end, much better than it might seem. I'd probably say that it will be fine at the end of the day, and it's about 6 PM right now.

Though there's one thing nothing will ever make me change my opinion about. *Twilight is best pony*
Oh god... I just want hug you forever! I'm sorry for your loss we are here for you and if you do ever watch it, you'll like It
God damn... I seriously just shed a tear. You should watch it in her honor. 
Someone stop cutting onions... please.. 

I'm terribly sorry for your loss. That letter has me tearing up, you had one good friend.
Oh god I'm crying, I'm so sorry for your loss! 
This destroys me. I'm very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you made her very happy in the end though and that means a lot. 
The world needs to hear this, if you don't mind me saying.
I was literally in tears by the end of this.  I'm so sorry to hear about this happenin'.  My best wishes are out to you! :(
[](/pinkasad) Well crap, now I'm bawling my eyes out. I am so sorry for you and your friend, it seems like you two had a very powerful friendship and I can't imagine the loss you feel right now.

Also, considering the situation, I really highly recommend that you read John Green's [*The Fault in Our Stars*.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fault-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1352747329&sr=8-1&keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars) It's about a young person living with terminal cancer, and it's one of the saddest, most beautiful books I've ever read.
[](/raritysad) [](/rdcry) That was beautiful, I'll admit I cried. I hope for only the very best for you in the coming time, and for the bad feelings to go away leaving only the good feelings to help you remember.
Sounds like your friend really lived up to the element of honesty she left you with.

It may be hard, but as many have said, she wanted you to canter on and continue your life. Some friends transcend the norm and become indistinguishable from magic.
Such an amazing story...I'm tearing up at work in front of my Android phone here.  It reminds me so much of this.  http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/269/6/c/carnations_and_forget_me_nots_by_pashapup-d4b1zbi.png
How does this post have over 400 downvotes? 

And you really should send this to Lauren Faust. Maybe she will turn your friend into a new pony on the show.
I know it must be incredibly hard right now, since everything pony-related must be reminding you of your loss and grief, but just remember, when you're ready to come back to the herd, that...

[](/rohhi)"It's true, some days are dark and lonely... And maybe you feel sad, but Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad!"


"So here's what I learned:

That friendship truly is magic."

We now have a good idea on what Twilight Sparkle's very last sentence on the very last letter on the very last episode of the very last season of MLP:FiM would be.

Hasbro/DHX: Make this canon please.


I really hope this letter comes a long way.  It's beautiful. It shows how powerful a good and cheerful show can be to those who needed cheering up the most. I feel for you and your friend. She will live on in your heart, probably mine too, and in that Applejack doll you so currently possess.

Your doll can't wait to watch the S3 with you, so get to it! 

My deepest condolences for the loss of a dear friend. I am a firm believer that the length of ones life is only the core of your actual existence. No one is truly, finally, gone until all that they changed in the world is gone as well, until the things they built have fallen apart, until those they have influenced no longer carry their memory, until that memory no longer stirs the heart and most of all until no one is left to say their name.

So when the pain you feel now has been quieted by the passage of time to a dull ache, and you can bring yourself to return to the things you've enjoyed together, she, be it in soul, or in memory, will be watching along with you.

I am once again sorry to learn of your loss and of her passing. Each one of us lessens the world by their leaving, and yet enriches it by their deeds and by the memories their loved ones carry. Thank you for sharing this here.

My condolences. I hope you will conquer your depression and that you will always remember your friend.
I am currently mid episode of the part one and I popped on here to browse a few photos during a commercial and inside ended up reading this. It always amazes me how deeply this show can bring people together. I want to send you my deepest condolences for your loss and I don't know if you'll even see this, but I would like you to know that you are an amazing person and I will definitely be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. This world needs far more people like you in it and I'm honored to have gotten to know you even a little through this post. God bless. <3
You're a hero. I hope you've realized that. You gave your friend hope in a time of complete hopelessness. You gave her something to hang on to. Something to look forward to. You truly were her knight in shining armor. To the end you stayed with her. And now, wherever she is, she is happy because of you. The kind of humanity that you have showed with what you did for her is beautiful. And if this tells you anything, it's that you have what it takes to get through whatever you're going through, or anything you might go through in the future. You are strong. You are caring. You are loyal. You're a hero. And I think I can speak for all of us as a community when I say that we're honored and proud to have someone like you here with us. I'm so sorry for your loss, and I wish you the best in the future.
I'm so sorry to hear this. I know I'm just a random stranger but it's part of who I am to wish that there was something I can do. So if there's anything we can do for you, you have but to ask. You have thousands of friends here who want to help in whatever way they can because they all truly believe in Lisas final message to you, "friendship truly is magic." 
This was so heartbreaking. I cried and I'm truly, truly sorry for your loss. I don't think I'm out of line, even as someone who doesn't come and comment here often, when I say that we're all here for you.
There... Are no words...
Of blessed memory.  But don't worry, you'll see her again in a few decades, and then you can watch Season 3 together!

EDIT: But I want you to know.  Now that she's given it to you for safe-keeping, you need to make that plushie the APPLEJACK THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
Tears are swelling up in my eyes. This is the most beautiful thing I have seen on Reddit since that really cute cat on r/aww. Don't just bring that Applejack plushie with you when watching the show; bring it everywhere you go. Your friend will be everywhere you go, as long as you bring AJ with you. And don't forget: She might be gone, but she is still alive in your heart.               
Never forget that.
I can't think of anything to say right now......just....wow......that hit hard, man. I struggle with depression too, so I know the feel. If there's anything you need, let us know, man. You truly are one of the best friends one could have.

Although, Derpy is best pony.
[](/pinkasad) I'm so sorry for your loss, that was a truly beautiful letter she wrote you. There is nothing that I can say to help you through this but please take care of yourself, I know it's the last thing on your mind but you need to do it.
manly tears were shed this day 
I don't know if you're religious or not, an atheist or not, or if you're just unsure what to believe. But I would like to share some words that comforted me when my mother died, and still comfort me. "Even as in Adam all men die, so in Christ shall be made alive." To know that death is ultimately defeated amd that all who have died shall live again, eternally, and as the Prophet Joseph Smith said it, that at that time "all our losses shall be made up", gives me hope for a better world.

Hope you find comfort in this hard time in your life. Take comfort that your love for her was not lost and that in the end you and she were both incredible. 
That was beautiful. The fact that you could make a person feel that happy and grateful is something you should carry with you always. You are valuable and you give something to those around you that they treasure. Please remember that in all that you do. I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you and good luck.

Just remember what life is all about; laughing and loving each other, and that people aren't really gone when they die. 

I'm really sorry for your loss, my friend. Our community will always be here when you return. 
I'm so sorry for your loss.  I can understand your pain at loss as my wife and I were about to get a divorce and we were avid Lost fans.  She left the week of the season finale, and after watching it without her on DVR, and seeing all the fans' goodbye messages during the commercial breaks, I equated it to a goodbye on my previous life, I about lost it completely.  Our break-up was not based on cheating, but on the fact that things had just gotten old between us.

But there is a silver lining to everything.  Death is extremely painful, especially when you receive a letter like that, you can end up hating the person for not letting you reciprocate the feelings or just having the last word.  Just know that you meant the world to her, and now you can go on doing the things she wanted to do in her honor.  If nothing else, DO go out and do things in her honor, even if it is things she would have never done, and hopefully that will bring both pleasure and peace of mind to you.  Depression is the worst, and IMO, there isn't really a drug or support group for it, but staying indoors doing nothing will only spiral the self-depression more.  Go outside and do something.  Just remember that life is worth living and those memories, however painful they are, will serve you later on in life for the better.  

One thing you could do in her memory though, for the plushie, make a saddlebag for AJ, and leave the note in there.  I'd offer, but I'm not that crafty unfortunately.
There are no words I can give you that other Redditors haven't already said.  This letter really touched me and I cried while reading it.  S3 of MLP came to me during an overall shitty semester, and I was able to escape in it and feel truly happy despite all my other problems.  I hope one day that you'll be able to come back to MLP and feel happy again, and would be able to capture again the warmth and magic of watching this with that special friend.  
It hurts, and you can never get rid of that hurt. But you can use that hurt to fuel you. Use it as a driving force, and most of all, never forget. Cherish each and every moment. For you never know when it might end. Memories are what make something special. Never forget her or anything you love. 

From, DJ.
I genuinely cried, this is such a heartbreaking story, I wish you the best in life and hopefully you will be able to continue your watching of the show :') Best of luck to ya mate
I really have no words to describe what I am feeling, but first of all, Thank you for sharing this letter with us. This letter is so profound and touching. I really hope you find strength through the show. 
I'm so sorry for your loss.  
Oh god... all of my feels...

You must be a really strong person, OP. This was beautiful. 
I am about to cry. I offer all of my condolences. That was truly beautiful.
Thank you for calling tech support.

No..I'm not crying...honest...
 >You would tell me that Rarity is the best pony, even though Applejack is the best.

You and your friend had wonderful taste.

[](/raritywhy "WHY MUST THE GOOD DIE YOUNG?!")
[](/raritydaww) Holy mother of feels. This is beautiful and sad and every other feel you can think of.

manly tears mate...

/me hugs

my total heart goes out to you both, and while she is gone in body, i hope she lives on in you, your applejack plushie, and throughout her friends and loved ones. it hurts to see her go, but that's how you know how much she really means to you mate
> Unable to watch the S3 premier and probably never will,

It's understandable that right now it hurts too much for you, but don't never watch it, she wouldn't want you to do that on her behalf, she would want you to watch it in her memory.

But yeah, give it a few weeks or something. It'll still hurt when you do a bit, but it'll be a good hurt.
[deleted]
It may take time my friend, but someday you should watch it.  She will be there with you.   
i always thought the after life would be some sort of payoff, So if she liked ponies, maybe in her death, she woke up as a pony, Just like all those terrible human in equestria fan fictions we all love so much...I am terrible with words.  [](/ajcower)
:( why are there so many sad stories about MLP
I'm tearing up in my Bio lecture. I don't cry at stuff. Thanks for sharing, OP. You're a better person than I.
You sound like a great friend, Adrian -- the kind of person everyone would want to be around even in good health. The dedication and compassion you showed to your friend is nothing short of remarkable and you are a far better human being than I could ever hope to be.
>even though Applejack is the best.

Hells yeah! I'm sorry, but this is the best bit!

[](/ajcute)

[](/sp)

Just kidding, of course.

[](/aj24)
my condolences, I can't say that I know this pain because I dont, but as with everything that happens we must push forward and never forget the past.  We can't let it control us, but we can't forget the things that have happened either.  

I really hope you dont give up completely on the fandom and the show because of this, because from the sounds of it she really wanted you to continue with the show for her.  I also know that it probably really hurts  to even look at this page right now, but dont give up, there are many people here who will support you and help you to get through this, bringing new memories and laughs that will take the sting off the bad. 

I can say this for myself because I have been dealing with depression for a long time, am finally getting some help for it, and thanks to this subreddit I have always been able to push through.  I hope this can be the same for you.  

Again I give my condolences, just keep your head up high and keep moving forward!
Why would people downvote this?  
This is the heart of what a mylittlepony Subreddit should be.  
Absolutely powerful, to say the least.  This, and the wave of positivity and love flowing out are what defines us as a culture.  
Stay strong, friend.  You always have friends on the internet.  
How can I upvote you so it counts?
I have depression as well, and for those that don't: Getting a letter like this makes you sad, but with depression it is absolutely crushing. Adween, though it may be hard for you, please watch the premiere with Applejack. Best of wishes to you, and my honors to Lisa.
From all your friends at /r/mylittlealcoholic , we will raise a pint in honor of lisa, and im sorry for your loss my friend.
One of my friend commited suicide, I still think about him. There are a few people in this world who can understand the awful pain. I am so sorry for your loss.
Well even if it hurts now, you'd better watch s3 eventually. Ifyou don't you're taking this beautiful friendship you had, and this beautiful letter she left you, and pissing all over it. She obviously doeant want you to give in to your depression, and you owe it to her to at least try to be happy. Don't be a bitch. You owe her this much.
[] (/raritysad) All the feels. All of them. Best of luck with depression.
I'm so, so sorry for your loss. One day you will be so very strong in your broken places.
Stay strong, my friend! Stay strong!
This is beautiful
I have just shifted into maximum overfeel.....and no that was not supposed to be a joke...
[](/twiright)I highly doubt a lot of the down votes are real, 

[](/rdcry)
this sub-reddit is too nice to down vote something so sad...
[](/cadance) you loved and tolerated the shit out of her

[](/ajhappy) you did your best tho!
They MIGHT have MLP in Heaven its a possibility [](/shiningarmour)
I shed tears. I hope Lisa enjoys season three in heaven.
Dear Jesus, I'm going to go cry now. I feel for you man, as a rare catholic on reddit, you're in my prayers...
[](/rdcool) Get on the floor

[](/louder)  Try not to cry

[](/rdcry) Cry a lot
Dude, if I could give hugs through the internet, you'd get about a million.  Not even joking.
http://i.imgur.com/mQFTw.jpg
This is heart breaking :( 
One of the most beautiful things I've ever read.
I'm going to love and tolerate whoever the hell left all these onions here.
Wow I cried and thats not me at all.  I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.
[](/c16) Sorry for your loss
well, i'm gonna be crying all day......... Im so sorry to hear man......... I hope things go well for you man. 
Nope.  Done.  I've had enough of the real world today.
Sadder than a chapter of Background Pony
A moment of silence for a fallen Pegasister. I hope there is a better place after life...
So... many... fucking... onions...
 http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3884-Sad_rarity.png
Man....kid at my school just passed away and just stopped being depressed about that....now you show this....

Really sorry to hear that. My deepest condolences.
That was one of the most touching things I have ever read. I'm sorry for your loss. Keep on going, brony. Lisa would want you to. Also, you'd better watch the Season 3 premiere with AJ. If not for yourself, do it for her.
I couldn't read more than about half of this. May she rest in peace.
Ouch.  I tried hugging the monitor and that ended poorly for my laptop.

My sincere condolences.  It's not much, but you have a random squad of internet loonies over here in your corner if you need us...
Right in the feels.  My god man.  That was beautiful, and your friendship with her is beautiful.  You made her life wonderful and you should be proud of yourself, and happy that she's not suffering.  Also be happy that you did so, so much for her.

I struggle with depression and anxiety as well, and you know that everypony, including me, is here for you, any time you need us :]  

Stay strong, my little pony :]
I am speechless, eyes welling but speechless. 
Nothing i could say could possible console your loss, or tell what an impression your story had.
But, Thank you Adrian. I would say when/if you watch S3 that well all be there with you. But i think with your applejack plush beside you, well just leave this as a private moment between old freinds.
I don't know if you will see this, but if you do, I want you to know this. This is one of the most touching things I've heard in my life. I am sorry for your loss; time heals all wounds. I wish you the best of luck, I am gonna go cry now. [](/whooves)
Oh god this post hit me like a ton of bricks. May your friend rest In piece. <3 
Sorry for your loss, Really wish I could hug you right now.
I can't even see the screen through my tears, but I hope I'm not making that many typos



The love you and your friend Lisa had for each other and for MLP will live on, and I know it will hurt for a long time to come, there is no doubt about that . . . but r/mylittlepony will be here for you every step of the way.



and here's Derpy to help you along [](/derpwizard)
I got the end of the second paragraph, then I broke down.. This is true friendship and magic..
Hats off to you. You know the true meaning of MLP:FiM
[] (/macintears) Bro I hope the void you feel mends and I know that someday, you will be able to use this fandom to not just honor the memory of your friend but also to relive the joy the 2 of you experienced together. 
*hugs adween*
I envy you Sir, to have such a beautiful letter written to you.  It shows the quality of person you are and you should be very proud of that.  I sit here a total stranger to this and it really touches me, that quality of kindness.

The sick feeling of loss, I know it's tough but don't let that be the overtone of this.  She left you with something so much more powerful than her loss, she left you with her admiration and love and some very good orders.  Take those powerful positive feelings she specifically left you with in the form of this letter and use it to fill your heart, what possible hope does depression stand when you have that and complete proof that you are a great person with true quality, that's as good as gold for the soul.  Just simply amazing...it truly is.

I wish the best to you Sir, and all I can say is that it's best not to keep a girl waiting as she may be joining you in spirit (which I more than believe), go watch that show and honor her, but with tears of love.

And thank-you, for sharing something so beautiful and personal with us.
Onions fucking everywhere....
That was beautiful. I wish you the best.
The most pure feels.
You know, I've never really considered the fan-made content of this show to be of any real substance. Now, I have to consider it with a different perspective.
OH GOD MY FEELS.

My condolences and I know you can overcome the constant struggle. You're going to be okay, baby.
[] (/macintears) THE FEELS
[](/a25) The feel man, the feels. If you ever need someone to talk to we are always here for you. Best wishes to both you her family and her friends.
All these feels...

I have emotional fluids streaking from my eyes... :(
I didn't ask for these feels.
God damn son... [](/macintear) this feels like the time I read my little dashie
I'm very sorry for your loss. I was recently in the hospital with a very severe pneumonia. I didn't think I was going to make it. The doctors weren't sure. But, as I was browsing through the TV, I saw Pinkie singing "Smile,Smile,Smile" and just starting singing along with her. That show convinced me that I was going to make it. Everybody knows the part where my day turned around. "It's true someways are dark and lonely..." I'm tearing up right now, but I just wanted to let you know that, your friend was right. Friendship is magic. It's something that takes a lot of effort to take away. Whenever you come back to watching the show, just remember your friend and that she loved you for who you were.
This is the most depressing thing I have ever read....
[](/rdcry) Empty night...

I'm crying so bad right now...
[](/ajbop) Yawl are goldurn awesome, sugarcube.
(/raritydaww).
i am sorry for your loss
I should probably not commenting with this account, but i just got something in both eyes.
I was bawling my eyes out
My condolences.

Remember, we'll always be here.
I don't even know what to say... this has taken the words straight out of my mouth. I volunteer at a cancer ward and I haven't experienced anything as heart wrenching as this.
I am truly sorry for the loss of your friend and my heart goes out to you and her family. I'm not very vocally active on this community, but from reading post and threads I can see how much love and support we all have for each other, and I hope that you can tell that we are all here for you right now. 
That is the most beautiful thing I've read all year.

Even though it's impossible, I want to get a group of chill folks from this subreddit and just hang out.
That's quite possibly the saddest thing I've ever seen on Reddit.

This was so beautiful, I wish I could describe it more but words can't even express. The amount of emotion and heart put into this- it's almost like reading a really good story, except the best part is that it's real. I'm so, so sorry you had to lose her, but I think it's amazing that you knew a person like her. You better cuddle that plushie hard when you watch S3. 
I know I felt awful for never contributing, but now I really feel bad.
Don't ever loose that plush, bro.
And now a grown man is crying at work....awesome story.
OH MY CELESTIA IT'S MY LITTLE DASHIE ALL OVER AGAIN!!! *Falls to the ground and sobs*
I wish I had words that could bring you the comfort that you deserve, I hope the following might bring you a little. Love, hope, faith, life, light, brightness, joy, peace, tranquillity, safety, pure, rest, glory. 
Oh dear, this made me cry. :(
I read this earlier today from my cell phone while I was at work. I was not able to say anything at that time and had to finish reading it in the bathroom so nobody would catch me crying. This was an incredibly beautiful letter, one that expressed the true essence of love and wasn't something scripted for a movie or tv show. Thank you for sharing this with us and also please accept my sincerest condolences to you and your friends family. I hope that you will be able to find Applejack as a supportive inspiration for you to move forward and overcome those things that your friend wished of you. I wish the best of luck to you, friend. 
A friend died two days ago. My boyfriend and I drunk shots of vodka in honor of this person being in our lives.

We do it because it is for them, not for us. It is a thank you for the good times.

If the roles were reversed what would you want her to do for you?

It sounded like she wanted you to watch the episode. Do it for her!
*Two hearts made to last*

*Fate is a cruel mistress though*

*Leading one to break*

[](/raritysad) I wish I could do more for you then give this haiku. 

I just want to tell you something, you squeeze that plushie, squeeze it and hug it as hard you can. Don't let her memory die she maybe gone  but she'll always be with you no matter what.

Once again I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry for your lost
I'm so sorry about this. I wish I could give you a hug or tell you that everything will be alright, but the best I can do is to give my condolences. Best wishes on your recovery, my friend.
[](/raritywhy)why
Hello Adrian, my name is Jacob. I to, am an outcast. I have been bullied all my life. Though I am twelve, I weigh 236 pounds. I have never told anyone my weight before, not even my parents. To top it all of, I look horrifying. I spent most of my time crying and  eating out if depression. Although I am kind to all, I am treated like a monster. I am not a monster right? Because I look different I am a monster? I fell into a heavy depression. I was afraid to talk to anyone. I then learned about my little pony. It changed my life. It gave me a positive outlook on life. I finally was able to talk to people again. The. Word got out at my school that I watch it, and people started calling this, fat, ugly piece of crap gay. It hurt even worse than before. I took a stand. Someone called me gay, so I slammed them into a locker and broke their nose. I whispered in their ear" I have enough god damn problems with ought your judge mental ass". Nobody said a word to me since. Then I met her. A pegasister. She changed me. I had a life again. It's been 6 months,and I have never been happier. I am not a monster for taking a stand and hurting someone, in fact I never wanted to. But I had enough of it. The moral of my story is to not be mean, or hurt someone, but that love is everywhere. Keep watching the show, so that she knows you care. It took a lot to confess this, even though you probably won't read it. Just do me a favor and watch it with applejack so she knows you care. Today I learned that: 
Sometimes, confessing the truth is the best way to be happy. 

Yours truly,
                 Jacob 

[](/macintears) You are a great person.  Keep that in mind.  I cried.  This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.  Ever.  I know this is a tough time in your life, just know you have a whole sub-reddit full of supporting bronies and pegasisters here to help you pull through.  Preserve your memories of your friend.  Even when times are tough, keep on going.  Keep being you, keep your amazing personality and your kind nature.  Again, remember that all of us are here for you.  
Freindship really is magic, so keep it alive.
My heart goes out to you. This truly brought tears to my eyes. Just remember that no one can take away the time you spent together, and that she will always be with you.
Dammit, dem feels. 
You are a great person, Adween. Your friendship with Lisa sounds like it had all of the elements, including magic. Stay strong. :)
That is the sadest and most hopeful thing i have ever seen I'm new to mlp but really my condolences and the best of luck to Godspeed 
Not sure if solid advice but. There was a post couple a few days back on how [Special K](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/12y8v1/yale_scientists_explain_how_ketamine_aka_special/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) (yes the drug) can help cure depression. 
Oh dear god, I was fine until the last two lines.

Wetface'd.  I'm so sorry bro. 
I cried.  That was beautiful.  I clicked the submission thinking this would be an attention grabbing post.  You are a wonderful person and I thank you for helping her be happy. [] (/rdsalute) 


Give ALL the upvotes!
[](/ajsly "Be Strong")
Don't run away from this kind of thing, she isn't really gone she lives through you now, your memories and your little apple jack plushie too. 
Embrace it, you'll be the one she is so blessed to have a guardian angel such as Lisa.
-Friendship is magic
I've had just a really tough, rough, and stressful day. Reading this just made me break down. I'm sorry for your loss, I really am. I am lost for words and just wish you the best.
Dammit I just teared up at this. 

I have never cryed while reading something before and i didn't during this either, but I honestly have never come closer to breaking down and letting it out. That was so touching, I'm very sorry for your loss.
You should watch the new season when you're able, because although it may be difficult, your friend is still there watching My Little Pony next to you in spirit.
Keep your chin up mate and keep watching, It sounds like that's what your friend wanted.
Just remember. Everything will be alright in the end. If its not alright, it's not the end. 
Best wishes. 
Awww you're such a sweet friend. I could tell you guys had so much fun together when the show came on. You've inspired me. Thank you.
My god. :( I'm already crying man.
So the first post I read on this reddit and it's the one that makes me cry like a baby? I'm really happy to have read something this amazing, but I'm very sad right now knowing that you lost someone who was so special to you, even if she wasn't special to you in quite the way she wanted to be. As much as I can't fathom the pain you must be going through right now, I'd encourage you to watch the new episodes sooner than later, it sounds like what she would've wanted based on the e-mail. More than anything though, I wish you well in your battle against depression. The story from this point on is yours to write though, and you're free to do with it what you will, and I hope you can find another friend as good as the one you've so recently lost, not to replace her, but to help you get through a time that can be so tough in life.
Guys, his friend died. And all you can think about is whether this is fake or not? Come on! Sir, I am sorry for your loss and sincerely hope that you are alright. Brohoofs and hugs all around.
As much as I am crying from the sentimentality of that heartwarming letter and confused by the cries of controversy based on your reddit history and the style of the letter... I have only one question... can we see a picture of your face scar?
Well I'm crying. I want to say something but I don't really have the words...
Damn, this post made me get something in both my eyes
Oh gosh, I just found this. And now I'm crying in my cubicle at work.
I take a reddit break and end up tearing up and wishing I could give you a hug...
I do not believe this because she said applejack is the best.
My feels...tearin' up over here D':
Friend-zoned and then pony blocked.  Man does that suck.  
FEELS! ALL THE FEELS! ;A;
Who THE HELL is down-voting this? 
No matter what the situation is, your friend will always be with you at heart.

Never ever forget that fact. For it seems that your friendship with her has developed a tight bond that even in death can never be broken.

My take on this is: I would definitely check out Season 3 still.

Your friend would probably not want you to mourn her loss forever. Because once you press play, I guarantee you: She's gonna be looking through your eyes and be right with you the whole step of the way.

May Celestia watch over the both of you and may your friend's soul be at rest.
[](/macintears) I would like to send my condolences to you and all who knew her. I am quite teary eyed right now, this letter really has hit home that you cannot take life, let alone anything for granted. We should all take solace in the little things in life. I really teared up after reading this, but I also smiled knowing that this community made a real difference someone's life. So i would like to thank you and everyone else in the community for making that possible.

Edit: Grammar
I had to stop reading in the middle because I couldn't see my screen. It sounds like you made a significant difference in her life… and I hope she's made a significant difference in yours.

That's the point of the Cutie Mark Crusaders

Source: http://genuinelylarry.tumblr.com/post/30501793916/what-if-tattoos-just-randomly-appeared-on-our-skin

This Image: http://dicksp8jr.tumblr.com/post/40058217087/thetimetravelersguidetothegalaxy
Well, sort of.  If we're being pedantic here, then the tattoos don't appear randomly.  They appear when you discover your innate talent for something.

It is a funny conversation, though.

[](/twismile)
I just hope the CMC's special talent isn't being on fire. :I
I'd love this to be real.
Also, the plot of Final Fantasy XIII...
The CMC writing about ponies who randomly get "cutie marks" and have to write about what it means.

[](/scootaderp) CUTIE MARK CRUSADER INCEPTIONISTS! YAY!!
[](/twismile)The concept of specialization in the individual is a very interesting one. If anyone is interested in a good story that deals with it, you should read a copy of Asimov's short story [Profession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession_(short_story).

[](/sp)
Synopsis of Profession in terms of MLP:

[There's a machine that every filly must use when they reach a certain age that is able to predict their cutiemark with 100% accuracy and print it onto them. The story begins with the main character dreading what he will receive and the result is worse than he could have imagined: he gets no cutiemark!](/spoiler)


[The bulk of the story deals with him trying to come to terms with the fact that he has no cutiemark. In the end he realizes that having no cutiemark does not represent one's inability to do anything, but rather one's ***unbounded ability*** to do anything. The story ends with the reveal that generalists like him are the ones who maintain the cutiemark machine and create learning material for all the cutiemarkees.](/spoiler)

[](/abhoppy)It's because of this story that I take pride in the fact that I'm not a specialist in any one thing and always render myself in pony-form with a blank flank.
There is actually a BBC Sherlock fanfiction based on this premise. The whole idea was that tattoos appeared after emotionally significant experiences or encounters. If someone didn't have any tattoos they were considered dangerous, sociopathic, and incapable of feeling. 

EDIT: To make this slightly more relevant to the subreddit...have a [Sherlock and John pony?](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/017/5/5/my_little_sherlock_by_krazy_chibi-d4mq7x8.png)
I just realized that cutie marks could make job interviews pretty easy.
Cue posts about what peoples cutie marks might be[](/abbored)[](/sbstare)[](/scootaderp)

Actually if you want a story about a tattoo appearing a person randomly, and that person being a total badass, look up Togashi Mitsu from Legend of the Five Rings.
So like, Scar in FMA?
This presents me with a really funny way to convince my friends the show is awesome..

Just tell them about this story 'idea' and then reveal to them it's actually the plot for FiM.

Unicorns, Earth ponies and Pegasi lived happily together in Equestria already before Twilight
I don't get it. Isn't a gen 5 a 5th reboot/re-imagining of MLP universe?

And not a straight continuation of a cannon?
Imagine an entire Generation of MLP “Ok Boomer”ing Twilight’s legacy on friendship.
I feel like people don't get how time over a long period works.
I like to think that something between this time happened and broke the peace between species, draining magic at the same time.

Like some eldtrich beast that now resides where once was Canterlot.
Pipp's expression is everything
I don't think it was ever established that Equestria is the ONLY place in the universe inhabited by ponies. The new generation could take place in a place completely outside of equestria, or just far enough in the future.

To put this argument to rest, I'd like to point out that peace is never everlasting. Who knows how many years have passed. Hundreds? Thousands? Societies can greatly change in that time, so who's to say that things were all sunshine and rainbows for all of Twilight's rule? Just because there's a chance for regression doesn't mean you shouldn't try and bring about a positive change.

[](/celestiahappy)*Thank the stars* there seems to be some agreement with my POV on this.

There are a few different reasons I can't accept G5 as being in the same realm as *my* G4, or at least not something I can just welcome with open arms like an old friend or something.  The writers aren't carrying over, that's obviously the big one.  I can't relate to the uncanny-valley facial designs.  But hey, those are just artistic concerns and matters of taste, right?

[](/gummystare)But the whole "I guess pony racism won after all" just so utterly defeats the lesson the ponies of G4 contended with *three times* and won out over--once in pre-Equestria history, once in the rejuvenated celebration of EUP by the Crusaders, and once in the big finale (albeit with those elements not having the opportunity for sufficient screentime).  They even went a step beyond by overcoming interspecies conflicts with accepting the Student Six into Equestria's fold, which took me a while to take in, but their overcoming the weaponization of friendship in Cozy Glow made that acceptance genuine in my eyes.

[](/lunaloom)Why should I accept G5 when it partially invalidates or tarnishes one of G4's supreme achievements?  It seems like such a monumental misstep to say these are part of the same universe, except as a cynical attempt to piggyback off the success of another creative team.  To this I say: I wish you the best, G5, but you must win my heart on the strength of your own tales of friendship.  'Til then, time to write G4 fanfics no one will ever read until I die, lol.
Goes to show the problems of rule by monarchy. :\^)

Without a strong transition of power the moment the charismatic leader(s) are gone, everything factionalizes.
Noo
Time probably repeats, Luster Dawn leaves for the human world and leaves no one to replace Twilight.  Somepony takes over and makes everyone upset.  Friendship is too powerful and gets outlawed lol idk.
Yeah no 

i just saw a trailer and i don't like it alredy

i don't care how many years have passed  i like to thing this is a totally diferent universe

i would've honestly prefered that mlp ended in g4.

it looks like your tipical generic children movie

this is just an opinion btw
In Gundam, every time the hero reinforces the idea of peace and unity. And within a few years, it‘s all forgotten and war ensues only for the lesson to be taught again.

In short, Twilight is a Gundam protagonist. And a Newtype.
Cool art/meme
I can only assume this is Twilight's ghost since she's been dead for eons in this new series.

On a side note, how are unicorns not extinct at this point? Mainly because of how they forgot to use magic?
Dammit, politics! I should have known it would be the arch nemesis to friendship!
What can one say? Maintaining harmony is an *active* effort.
Maybe there will be an explanation. I'm keeping an open mind and some hope to see what happened :)
In some way it makes me angry, years of uniting the species in and beyond Equestria, just for being destroyed some centuries after.

I'm open minded, but I feel disappointed for that fact.
To be fair putting an emotionally unstable girl with no idea how to run a country and who HATES attention in charge of the entire country might have been a bad idea.
I mean things won't stay peaceful forever, and I actually like the idea some people have that G5 is in a different timeline considering what Starlight did.
Yeah that is really god damn stupid. If this wasn’t called New Generation it would’ve been fine but no, they had to connect it despite everything being super different.
Oof
I mean, that explanation makes just as much sense as anything in season 9 or G5.  I tossed out season 9 because it was so bad, and I will not be watching G5 at all.
This is my biggest reluctance with the New Generation; back in the beginning of the series, the three races lived together pretty harmoniously and in the finale they were still good with each other along with the other species; but now after all of that, everything got worse than where she started diminishing all of Twilight's efforts.

How did everything get worse from square-one, did everyone just forget about Twilight's lessons, what happened to the Friendship School, what happened to the other species that learned the friendship lessons? They're going to have to give a very good explanation onto how everything got like this.
"Suddenly I don't feel bad about rule 34 and cloppers existing"-Twilight probably
Yeah, that seems about right.
True story, bro :(
I was just thinking about making a comic about this, LOL
The elements were just symbols tho
All I can say is that Discord would have loved this.
RIGHT!?
And thus

The worst gen was born
Isn’t this meme dead?

Well dang, I'd say this was a pretty coincidental prediction posting [luna right before an episode where she made a major unannounced appearance](/spoiler).
[](/lunateehee) Episode's over! Now we will!!
[](/flutterroll)You could at least have used a better picture...
[](/celestia) Well that was a good night's sleep. Did I miss anything, sister?
[](/ppboring) yeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh......about that....
[](/seriouslunadance) Please no image macros!
haha, I made this pic a long time ago. funny to see it reposted. It was made during the America/Europe sleeping upvote battle
OP is a soothsayer! 
after seeing today's episode, this post is more than a coincidence now. it was predicting luna's appearance!
 
[](/scootaloo "Well, everypony except Scootaloo")
[](/sbbook "Right, as she said, every*pony*") 
[For LUNA!](http://i.minus.com/iinD6UeZCQX8Y.gif)
This is far, far too relavant to the episode
Interesting how this was top upvoted [right before an episode with Luna playing a major role](/spoiler), should be spoiler tagged xD
Here is what the linked Quickmeme image says in case the site goes down or you can't reach it:

You are pretty much asking for upvotes so you get a downvote from me.
'Tis impossible for me to not upvote Luna. 
Apparently [there was a trailer](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittleconspiracy/comments/14grkv/luna_has_more_powers_than_we_thought/) of the episode before it aired. Didn't see it, but if there was one, then this probably wasn't a prediction...

...Oh what, it's my cake day! Just when I came back from lurking, too.
Can't argue with the facts
This is more than ten times the amount of upvotes this macro got when I made it.

[](/nmm) now I understand why she wanted it to be eternal night 
Upvote for proper use of everypony
Everyone upvotes Luna when they're awake, too!
Brings me back to the good ole "mode are asleep, post ponies" days.
[](/lunawink) Upvoting due to amazing coincidence with newest episode, not because it's an image macro.
[](/sbstare)
Seriously, we need more Luna episodes.  Proper ones where she makes more than just a cameo. 
Goodbye Luna, for the world is ending. Here's an up vote...



LOL the worlds not ending :p
Anything involving Luna deserves an upvote. Upvote a random Luna pic if you agree.
Twilight Sparkle and MLP plushies have accidentally become a symbol of protest in Russia against Putin and the FSB after this photo of political prisoner Anna Pavlikova went viral. Protestors brought pony plushies to demonstrations for her release, and she was moved to house arrest.

Twilight saving friendship once again.. 🙏

Ponies Against Putin

Hold on I need to make a sequel to my Cutie Mark Crusaders vs Cuban Missile Crisis story based on this
I’m a bit out of the loop, what happened/where can I read about it?
Ponies bringing the world together I love it
For friendship, for harmony, for Equestria!!!
* taps hooves in support *
Nice. I'm glad people are protesting for human rights. That ponies are becoming symbols for it is just awesome bonus.
At last, a good reason to buy ponies in public.

"Oh, I'm not into it, just supporting Ukraine is all."
Sorry for not including a source! I saw this in the new documentary “The New Greatness Case” by Anna Shishkova

Wow that's crazy but it's good to know the magic of friendship is always stopping injustices or at least this seems like an injustice.
Told you my Winnie the Pooh/twilight sparkle slash fic would be useful
I LOVE THIS FACT
Stay strong ✊✊✊
Well, if noponyelse is going to say it...

FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC!!!
good
I definitely support this
By Celestia’s mane, ponies *do* make everything better! They can even help stand up against authoritarian oligarchies.
Alright. I probably will get downvoted to hell for it, but i believe truth is important

I live in russia, and despite what some may believe, there are a lot of information sources here, including unofficial ones. Censoring everything is impossible with our current systems (we are not china lol), nor it is the goal.

And this is the first time i see this picture or hear this story. I don’t say it doesnt exist, but claiming it went “viral”, or “ponies became symbols of protest” are too much of a stretch. Besides, there is not much protest to begin with at this point, people who did not agree with government and feared whatever just moved to neighboring countries with no-visa agreements.

Don’t believe everything you hear, even if you really want to. As a russian, i had to learn it early on in my life
is that real?
as cool as this is, can you please provide a source cause i looked it up, and the only think that came up this post,  


i would really like this to be true
Sweet awesome ponies! They always save the day
Twilight Sparkle paving the way for friendship as she does
Never thought I’d ever read something like this in my life.
I never thought I’d see the day where I could use Derpy Hooves against the evil scum that is Putin >:D
This was in 2018, why they would bring this now as a symbol of protest? doesnt make sense
![gif](giphy|pNPX5BKKwEnf2)
You do know that that was, like, 4 years ago, right?
I’d really like to see footage of that, lmao
Yo is this real?!
Using the power of friendship to help :)
*plays "my shooter" music while watching russian propaganda*
Revolution is magic!
Wat da hell
The friendship lies within us!
Hasbro's marketing department gonna start giving out free plushies to political prisoners.
The power of friendship!
Reject Russia, embrace USSR.

- Phrases Starlight Glimmer could have said.
IMPORTANT: 


This is not related to Ukraine! She was framed by a Russian secret agent for “plotting against the government” in 2018 before the war. Thankfully, the protests mentioned for her release were successful and have since ended, she is now at home under house arrest, rather than the 10 year sentence she could have been given. There is footage of the protests in the documentary mentioned below.


SOURCE:  “The New Greatness Case” by Anna Shishova, independent Russian journalist
If I had a bit for every time Twilight Sparkle was relevant to real-world politics, I'd have two bits. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
I guess it's time for supporters of the Russian government to take this even further. I know that many Russian soldiers likes anime and so have some anime merchandise with them on the front, so we need to send Russian army some of this MLP toys!
GLORY TO UKRAINE!!!!🇺🇦 PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TO EVERYONE!!! Ponies are here to spread friendship.

Also, don't blame Russian citizens for the actions of higher ups. Friendship is magic! #brony4life
Damn.. Screw The Russian Military
Fuck the Russians for always making everything about themselves
Now i want to get one too. And post a pic of it just to anger putin
First Gadget Hackwrench, now Twilight Sparkle.
Well that escalated
But why?  I’m just confused.
Bruh, no it didn't.
Source: I freacking leave here
YES, BRING PONIES TO PROTEST EVERYONE!!
Well this was not on my 2022 bingo card
Okay so help me understand something here like how in the world have Twilight sparkle and MLP plushies become a symbol of protest in Russia against Putin like I'm not against protest But how................. help me understand

Tag Tara strong on twitter it might raise awareness about Anna
I honestly forgot about MLP until this came up on my feed talking about the symbol being used as protest against Putin 💀
Source?
Why do you guys have to push politics on everything? Take some time out, have a snickers
There's no way that's real
This is good news about our alicorn princess, I hope Twitter doesn't censor this, since these protesters need all the help and communications they can get.

Earlier Twitter was trying to censor Russians, due to the whole Ukraine thing (I see this as a bit shooting themselves and us "We stand with Ukraine", since there's some Russians that are on Ukrainian's side).
Tired already with your politics!

Lol this is adorable
Haha cute

#[](/twirage) DISCORD!
I love this comic because it feels like something that could be the plot of an actual episode if smartphones existed
Flutterworm is adorable.
Fluttershy gets into the dark arts again
I could hear her voice saying it in my head 😂
I want to read the rest!
Do the Rick and Morty  Rick turn into a pickle scenes
"Some stuff has happened"  XD
Discord?
I like how she still has her mane XD
Now I'm wondering where they would keep their phones
*i see it all.*


Flutterworm will not be able to fly, turning her from a pegasus into a earth pony/earthworm. discord will be freaking out and the rest of the Mane Six will be confused as heck.

and Flutterworm probably can't talk now.
Gal’s doesn’t even have her eyes so she can look sorta sad with them, or even show what is her facial expression weither she appreciates being turned into a small critter cuz surely she must find worms cute too like any other creature cuz she’s fluttershy!
Yea
Goodbye MLP:FIM

I closed down my University's Brony Club today.

We only had about 3 people coming per week. So we had one big last party for the finale. I was absolutely amazed when 25 people showed up. It's sad to say goodbye, but it was nice while it lasted.
it never dies. the world lives on in mlp. there are untold stories sitll. the future of equestria, flurry heart's trials as an alicorn, spike's adventures as an ambassador. and tales even further into equestria's future. the world lives on. even though we may no longer be privy to those stories.
Just like with most fandoms, it will live on in the hearts of the people who continue to watch it anyway
Bless it all **I am not crying** about a comic grim reaper talking to a cartoon horse
Thank you mlp for being there for us when we need you the most and even though you are over, this fandom will always be there for you. And hey we have gen 5 and a new movie coming in the next year or so so ya
This show came along right when I needed it to, when I least expected it, and didn't even know I needed it. It's been my home since 2012, my friend...

And now it's gone. It lived its life, and it was good.

F
Leaves from the vine

 Falling so slow
9 years ago I was some dumb kid in high school who liked MLP. Today, I'm slightly less dumb and I still like MLP.

I've been so sentimental all day, even though I haven't watched the show in awhile. I made some real, life-long friends because of this show. I've had some experiences because of this show that I will literally never have again. I wouldn't change a darn thing, either.

Thanks for all the memories, everybody.
I can't express how much I loved riding this ride with all of you. 

The ride never truly ends.
I'll miss you MLP.

*cues up Episode 1 on Netflix*
#GREATEST SHOW OF ALL TIME

[](/earassault "in its own little way")
Honestly, I’m really upset that it’s ending. I watched all the movies, all the seasons, (I didn’t read any of the comics, so I might just do that), I even probably watched most of the parodies/fan made videos. I even met my bf on a brony website (cloudsdale) 8 years ago and we’re still dating. MLP helped me through a lot. It inspired me to become the artist that I am today. But, it was nice while it lasted. Who knows, maybe something else will come along in the future but until then, I’m just going to rewatch everything. Thanks for everything, ponies ❤️
Shows die twice, when they end and when they are forgotten
Man, this show came out at the best time of my life and is now leaving. I'll cherish the friends and memories I made with it.

Without MLP I wouldn't be the same person I am now. I wouldn't have a passion for writing, I wouldn't have the fond memories I have with the fandom.

Thanks MLP, I will never forget you.
Meanwhile, I'm still on season 8 because of work interfering with my show watching habits the past year and a half, so luckily I get to catch up for another season.
I hope that the fandom will keep continuing on, but it's already brought me plenty of happiness if it does not.

It feels like forever since I heard someone recommend My Little Pony and thought "Seriously? Eh, I'll just watch one episode."

It's been a great ride, everyone.
I’m not crying, you’re crying
I’m still crying tbh, I miss this show already ;-;
It's not dead yet. For better, or for worse, the story is in our hands now.
Ways to get a gal crying here!
*”The many miles we walk”*

*”The many things we learn”*
It will never die as long as it stays in our hears and in our sweet memories. I will be a brony to the end
[](/ktwicry)  I got a handful episodes left, took my next week off from work to enjoy it uninterrupted... and I already know my eyes will flow out liquid pride when the end credits roll one last time.
I'm not crying, you're crying
FUCKING THE BEST IN THE WHOLE WORLD FUCKING THE BEST
I love all you guys <3
This one hit home 😔
Who knows, maybe G6 or G7 will be "G4 the sequel". Ten years after the end of S9, the Crusaders, Spike, Flurry, and others go on adventures of their own, while the Mane Six cameo here and there.
So... Where does r/mylittlepony go now?
1. I like the edit that says “you ruined the internet for 10 years”
2. So long as two are gathered to argue whether RariDash or RariJack is the better ship, the ride continues.
I kind of mentally separated season 1 wtih other seasons, so for me in a sense it will never end. It's like i have two version of the show, the one with an open ending after Grand Galloping Gala ended and S9 ending.
This image is too sad. :'(
I'm not crying! 

It's just liquid pride...
This is stupid. The fandoms not dead. Stop making comics where she dies. She'll be back in G5.
If someone told me 10 years ago that MLP will competing with the Justice League and the Avengers for my attention, I would had asked if they were serious after laughing like JJ Jameson.

Now I am crossing ponies with every single one of my favorite franchises while ponies are a big factor in my path in life.

Friendship is Magic.
Allah will stay in my heart
WHATS HAPPENING TO MLP!?
All goo things come to an end :(. But we'll still be here to carry on the legacy.
Did anyone notice that death said that he was told that MLP was the best and not really his opinion?
We will never die... G5 is in a couple years we just gotta last til then. To quote sovereign from Mass effect "We have no beginning, we have no end, we are infinite" "we are legion, the time of our return is coming, our numbers will darken the sky of every world"
Started watching right as I joined the military.
I wasn't prepared to cry gosh dang it! 9 years of awful life cheered up inspired by this beautiful show.
This may be a end but it isn’t the end. All the memories, happiness, impact and unforgettable experiences we’ve all had with the show will never end. It’s okay to be sad I sure as hell was last night but I related to everyone so much by how terrifying it is to say goodbye to a big part of your life. But sometimes the end is only the beginning of a new era. Regardless of how G5 turns out, we can forever take pride in how this one of a kind show ended up where it was.
Ok, I never thought that I would be a part of a fandom for a little girls TV show. I just got curious one day about 4 and a half years ago and after watching the first episode, I was hooked for some reason. Maybe it was the cuteness of the characters, maybe it was the messages the show delivered, or how it allowed me to not think about how crap the world is for a few moments. 
Also, without MLP, i wouldnt have met so many awesome people (huge shout out to the Blank check discord community) and watched and read all of the awesome fan content that has come out throughout the years, (best fic I've read and listened to has definitely got to be Fallout Equestria)
And the songs that have come from MLP, holy crap, I've had those songs in my head from the first time I heard them. 
But anyways, I am definitely going to miss the series and I hope the best for the future of the show and the awesome fandom, which I hope will stay as long as possible. Cheers for the good times...
THE RIDE NEVER ENDS!!!!
I haven’t seen season 9 yet, when will it be available on Netflix?
While I've never really created any music or art or video content, I've been a member of the fandom since early season 1 and I'm so grateful to all those who did. These last 9 years I've loved more than just the show, I've been enjoying everything inspired by the show from fanfics to SFM videos and I'm glad I got to be a part of this amazing community. G5 may be coming but, at least in my opinion, there'll never be anything quite like Friendship is Magic and never any group of fans quite like the bronies. I am so glad this wonderful cartoon and all the amazing people it inspired have been a part of my life. Thank you MLP:FIM.
Who put this water in my eyes?
the ending kinda gave me a feeling of [SCP-1762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJW5b-sBx1k) Not that there horrible things happening but that there is still adventures and life going on and its no longer here to... be here. The box is closed and they moved away from the gateway that let me peer in.


But hey! At least there is that comic and fan fiction.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
