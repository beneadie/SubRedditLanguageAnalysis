Summer 2022

Not loading on mobile
I wonder what counts as a "tease".

My assumption is something like... just his eyes in a single shot. Or just a finger of Gorr. Or the mouth of Gorr. Ankle of Gorr. 

NOSE of Gorr, mayhaps?
To those who can't see it's a prediction poll. Will Gorr show in the trailer?

Yes
No
Only a tease 

I couldn't load from mobile either
Why is this post 17 hours and the comments are over a month old?
I'm gonna vote no cause I'm always wrong and that way I can make him appear.
Yes and only a tease are kinda the same thing lmao
I am so fucking confused right now what is this comment section
Why is this 194 day old post showing on my front page as 17 hours old?
What counts as a tease? Like, I'm only expecting plot details which hint to him, and the money shot being of him. Is that a tease, or would just a shot of someone holding a black sword be a tease? This is a weird prediction lol.
What counts as New Jersey? Any scene within Kamala‚Äôs house, Bruno‚Äôs convenience store building?
At the very end, yes.
The big reveal at the end of the teaser was Jane Foster Thor. The reveal in this trailer will be Gorr.
Ima bout to lose all my tokens üòé
Where am i
I completely forgot who Josh is lmao
Love and thunder reminds me of WoW Orcs‚Ä¶ Blood & Thunder!
Why is this particular post the way it is
Kamala's parents already know the enumerated powers of the office of the Vice President of the United States.  It's in the Constitution.
LMAO definitely not. Maybe near the end of the season. (I fully expect Ms. Marvel to be a multi-season show.)
What are we even looking at here?
My optimism totally got all these wrong...
He already mentioned the Book of Vishanti in one of the trailers
Of course they'll show him, why wouldn't they?
Nah she‚Äôs not gonna get the full suit till the finale imo
They way it‚Äôs been going‚Ä¶.nobody
6 is the devils number üòàü§òüèªüî•
How do we know that Jen isn‚Äôt in New York?
Why do these get so crazy amounts of upvotes? I can't even interact with this on old reddit

edit: seems to be an ongoing thing as I see comments from 5 months ago even though it says submitted one day ago, interesting.
Doesn‚Äôt this technically take place before MoM? Cause this is happening concurrently with Shang chi which is before MoM.

I know on Disney+, it says it‚Äôs after MoM but refer to my previous sentence as to why that‚Äôs not entirely accurate.
This isnt loading, what is it?
They have to at least tease their villain a little
I'm really curious why they're hiding Gorr so much from marketing? He's got a figure and official artwork, so his appearance isn't a secret. You'd think they'd want to advertise Christian Bale. Hela was all over Raganrok's marketing, and very prominent in the trailers.
He's not like the freaking Joker where DC would be teasing if he'll show up in a Batman movie or not.

Nobody in the casual audience knows him, they have to introduce him and his threat in the trailer of the movie he's the only villain of.
New Jersey is everywhere

(Also most of this is Atlanta, so what are we really doing, ya know ?)
I scrolled past this and only saw the title. Got very confused as I thought it was referring to Madam Vice President.
If she was to be revealed to be an Inhuman (besides the comics accuracy even in the show they said that Thor would have be called a Djinn based on where he first landed so don‚Äôt take that name 100% seriously) it will probably be in The Marvels with the Kree connection and also I think they will finally answer the whole ‚ÄúIs Cap living on the Moon? Joke question that‚Äôs been brought up a lot as it‚Äôs the Inhumans all along
I love how the top comments are just trying to figure out if we're old or not
He already kinda did in the trailer
yay! these are so fun!
i mean, we know matt and jen will hook up, so there has to be some way to get josh out of the way, and soon.
I hope it‚Äôs not other Jack or whoever that was in Hawkeye moment. Yes it‚Äôs pretty obvious it‚Äôs him but I don‚Äôt care.
Just a end credit scene with She-Hulk looking at the camera saying "well... guess this is happening now."
Where‚Äôs the poll for why Matt murdock was in the west coast?
No way they show trailer for GOTGIII after the special.
Yeah these things that never work and load for me! Let's see if it loads this time!

Edit: Nope! Lol....
Real juicy spoilers guys
To make us keep watching this horrible show‚Ä¶
No one cares.
Who the hell thought Daisy would show up in an MCU show?
Reed Richards is in second place
900 upvotes and i cant see it :(
What is considered a "tease"?

How many seconds of a minutes long trailer?
0o
Idk, I just hope Shadrak, God of Bombs and Fireballs, makes an appearance
If this is being shown during a Basketball game, does this mean it'll be a shorter trailer?
It's necessary for them to show him, if his design is bad like in the leaks, fans could atleast embrace it before release, otherwise they're just gonna trash it like they did with Doctor Strange
The mom already knows... She knows about the bracelet powers but maybe she don't believe it cuz she thinks is a legend or a family curse
As a self identifying Captain Marvel stan of course I want to see Carol make an appearance, but I‚Äôm doubting that she will?
I'm saying Carol. Brie Larson loved the role and she even reprised the role in the Cruise experience, so she would only need to film in front of a green screen. Maybe she didn't even meet Iman Vellani
80% or so of the footage for most Marvel Studios trailers and stuff leading up to a new TV series is stuff from the first episode. My guess is we'll see both.
If I was a betting man, I think itll be Jen pre-accident, the accident, Hulk training, and then end with her returning to New York.

It'll also be the last time we see Mark Ruffalo and that'll annoy people.
gnoW?
I WANT NOVA, ONLY CAME HERE TO COMMENT THAT, HAVE A GOOD DAY
Wow I feel old
Summer 2023?
She hulk is trash I swear I‚Äôm trying but damn it‚Äôs no good
This is my Reddit's recap greatest September post; GREAT..!
I haven't started watching the show bcuz they changed too much of her. If it is revealed she is an Inhuman, I might watch it.
People are still watching this garbage?
Has he not shown up yet?
This is confirmed? Gorr is in the Love & Thunder LEGO set.
Bruh anyone else have no coins
Predictions Tournament

I‚Äôm fully expecting something similar to what Sony just did with the final Ghostbusters trailer. They‚Äôll be teased and confirmed for the movie without being shown
Topher Grace cameo
Peter Parker (Tom)
Ned
JJJ
MJ
Happy
Flash
May
Dr strange
Wong
Bridge
GG
Oct
Lizard
Electro
Sandman
Matt Murdock

No Andrew and Tobey but they will be tease
Sony will spoil several major plot points, but we still won't see Toby and Andrew. "Look Kevin, we kept the big secret just like you told us!"
Spider-Man will appear
Peter will suit up on a bridge.
I have no clue how these works but I placed the max bet I could !

Edit: welp‚Ä¶
Annihilation is the title
wife needs shoes the baby needs clothes 
COME ON REDDIT DONT LET ME DOWN
*Full shot with the three Peters*

Uh...phrasing
Pro tip : Bet against they appearing , if they appear you will be happy if they won‚Äôt at least you get some tokens
Gonna be a great week for people wronged by Jake Gyllenhaal.
Page Not Found for anyone else?
Btw guys no matter what we see in that trailer,it‚Äôs been a pleasure to share this hype with you guys.
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ GIVE TOBEY-MAN AND ANDREW-MAN ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
Strange isn't responsible for the Multiverse opening
There will be a bridge

There will be a Spider-Man

There will be a Doctor

that‚Äôs about it
B I G

W H E E L

you read it here first, folks
Tom Holland is the star of the film
- Mostly focused on the villains with a full reveal of them.
- Lots of Green Goblin scenes.
- Quick scenes of Sandman and Lizard.
- First footage of the Integrated suit and more footage of the Reversed suit along the magical bracelets.
- No Matt Murdock on trailer.
- Stinger is a very obvious reference to Tobey and Andrew by Ned or Strange followed by Tom's reaction. Possibly an off-screen line by one of them.
- Right after that, in the closing title before the release date we get some sort of cool transition between the spider logos of the 3 Spider-Men.
The sixth villain is Jeffrey Epstein
Option 4: They actually reveal a trailer for Spider-Man 4, the movie Raimi has been making with Elfman and Murawski with the budget of DSMOM
Max bet placed for tease, can‚Äôt wait to win and quit my job with the winnings üòé
- They show off all the villians, but Lizard and Sandman don‚Äôt get a line in the trailer, just Green Gobby, Doc Ock, and Electro
- They tease Andrew and Tobey, but don‚Äôt literally show them 
- Spidey‚Äôs Intergrated Suit finally is shown off properly and posters from here on out use it instead of the Iron Spider suit
- Trailer has a lot of clips of Holland getting the shit beaten outta him
- Stinger is Matt Murdock
Daniel Craig as the bridge.
Hedging my bets: We'll get hinted at multiple Spider-Men, but no faces.   Just two other dudes in suits.
Idk how these prediction things work but I'm kinda starting to think they won't be shown at all but just teased in some way, like hearing their voices or Tom saying something about them/reacting to them, like "You guys are different versions of me?" or something
Matt Murdock, no Spider-Men lol
They‚Äôll have a motif shown or something similar, with no direct look at the actors or characters.
The back of Andrew‚Äôs head (in his Spiderman suit).
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|SF9Z0shNT07T2)

My face during the trailer absorbing it in all its glory
my prediction? All three Spider-Man kissing passionately on the screen for 3 minutes
I heard Spider-Man was there...
Here's my list:


-We will see a bit more of the Doctor strange scene, as well as why him and Peter are at odds with eachother during the movie. 


-Norman Osborn will speak


-We will see each of the five villains in full- getting our first full shots of The Lizard, Electro, and Sandman


-We'll see Norman Osborn flying on his board



-Teaser of Andrew and Tobey, not full body shots



-The after title snippet will be Charlie Cox saying he'll defend Peter for trial
A wild Daredevil appears
Safe, boring prediction: all five multiverse villains will be shown clearly in multiple shots. More elaboration and/or exposition on the idea of the multiverse and the general plot of the film.
[deleted]
DanielRPK - you need to be stopped.
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS, ITS UNFAIR
Trailer just came out 5 minutes ago and got 1.2 million views , goddamn
They better incorporate the music from Raimi‚Äôs trilogy for all the nostalgia feelz
NWH revealed to be an adaptation of Kraven's Last Hunt, co-starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.
![gif](giphy|8FV8DMUqB6oUOsDkQd)
The main villain of the movie is actually traffic. Doc Ock along with his 4 friends are actually the heroes trying to solve New York's traffic problem by building a nice new bridge when new villain Peter Parker comes to town to foil those plans.
I think it‚Äôs great that it hasn‚Äôt leaked yet - we can all react together :)
I really hope Ben affleck shows up to announce his own Batman movie 

Wait fuck where am I
Check out 2:23 in the trailer. Lizard is obviously attacking someone else. The other Spider-Men have been edited out. It‚Äôs very obvious.
lmao how is this the most upvoted post on this sub
Final shot of Peter MJ and Ned with weird looks at a portal opening in front of them
as someone who grew up with Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy what I remember most about anything regarding those movies, besides Christmas opening up the VHS for the first one (that stays top memory), wasn't the movie itself but the awe of seeing the trailers, TV spots, toys, all the buildup to these movies.

&#x200B;

Yeah sure I bet nostalgia is giving me rose tinted goggles but I can't be the only one who thinks hype was just different back then. I was most excited to see that type of buildup with Tobey again this winter. Going into a target and seeing a classic Raimi Suit toy.
Maybe it‚Äôll be like Michael Keaton in The Flash, where it‚Äôs just hinted.

Edit: Well‚Ä¶ I was sort of right.
I think it‚Äôs unreasonable to hype it up so much and have a whole event if they wouldn‚Äôt at least tease a voice or a shadow
betting 100 on fully showing them cause that what I want even if its the most unlikely lol
Where is spidey man
I bet 1/4 portion!
I watched it and the stream kept freezing smh
Oh the meltdown!!!!
I WAS HERE WHEN IT ALL WENT WRONG
money today let‚Äôs go
Where‚Äôs my boy?

![gif](giphy|8cBaa98f0SPSsQ5YOc|downsized)
1.The presence of like a shit ton of scaffolding lends some weight to the leaks, no?
2 .And if that‚Äôs the case I think that the variant Spideys are just gonna show up for what appears to be the finale.
3. Wasn‚Äôt there some bullshit about the Statue of Liberty having Cap‚Äôs shield? Did I miss that? (Nevermind. I see it on the HD/Widescreen version)
So I will say I‚Äôm very excited Alfred Molina is back as Doc Ock, but that means I lose out on my top choice to play The Beast‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm just here for the chaos
Tobey Maguire will return...
I WANT SPIDER-BRIDGE!!!!
How come these never work for me on the Reddit app? It just takes me pack to the home of the sub Reddit
How to tease them. Just play the raimi theme very slightly for like 3 seconds at the end.
My prediction. All 3 Spider-Men revealed + Matt Murdock scenes will be shown.
What Thor haha
I love this sub. There‚Äôs always something going on.
I don‚Äôt even know anymore. No Way Home may just be a social experiment at this point
My dream trailer would be Matt's trial speech going on about Peter to a montage of scenes from the film.
Now stay with me. Venom will take up the whole trailer
really hoping for a line or something from Jamie Foxx in some kind of powered up Electro form
Mr. Ditkovich will appear
[mods in 13 minutes when everyone tries posting the link at same time](https://data.whicdn.com/images/257767193/original.gif)
Does the event start at 8:30 or trailer at 8:30
Where‚Äôs the trailer!!!
Feel like I‚Äôm going to puke
Where trailer??
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
SPIDER MONDAY BITCH
Flash from Sam rami‚Äôs spider man gonna come help Peter.
Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Jacob will act better than they did in that reaction video from yesterday.
Real question... are we gunna see a full reveal of the ENTIRE bridge?
I was...right? They were teased, right? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the real Peter Parker". Who else is coming through that portal?!
No Tobey. No Andrew. Called it.
Do I go with my heart or my brain???? This is the saddest fucking choice I've ever had to make.
i don't buy rpk saying they're not in it, i know he is always right on trailers but anything on that account seems a bit trolly to me
Toward the end of the trailer we see Tom struggling to fight the film's five villains, Ned arrives at the scene just in time and excitedly yells "Whoa, now there are three Spider-men!" and we hear a medley of the themes from the Raimi and ASM movies. But turns out it's just an attempt to distract the villains who all turn to Ned with a confused look as the other 2 are nowhere to be seen or heard! 

Cut to titles. 

V.o. Tickets on sale now!
If the rumors are to be believed, then we see silhouettes at the end that ‚ÄúIMPLY‚Äù they‚Äôre in it.
I think we can all agree Tobey and Andrew where teased with that Dr.Strange line stating "they were killed by their spidermen"
They ain't showing shit until the movie, if they wanted to, Sony would have teased it by now, we ain't getting shit until the movie
![gif](giphy|w9t0aFMjahdxpKKvzN|downsized)
I need all the Peters and I need full blown Cox.
just like spideyleak said, they will be teased only.
My gut says they‚Äôre gonna tease them. I have a feeling Sony might actually show some restraint for once and not show off their full looks.
They can‚Äôt be making such a big deal about this without having the 3 Spider-Men in it. It just wouldn‚Äôt make sense
Ned opens portal and an ASS shot of Tobey and Andrew appears
I imagine a final scene in the trailer after the titlecard where the music cuts out and then focuses on something that either hints at the other two Spider Men or actually shows them. 

I‚Äôd love a final shot where the music cuts out, then an over the shoulder of Tom talking to two unknowns. A sudden noise of a nearby villain(s) causes the unknowns to turn around, showing a close-up of their upper bodies and masks and revealing Andrew + Tobey. Just my imagination but that would be perfect lol.
‚ú® Evan Peters returns ‚ú®
Let‚Äôs do more of these!
Large Wheel üôè
The other two spider-men aren't from other universes but are actually Peter Parker's clones Ben Reilly and Kaine Parker.
I vote partial
J. Jonah Jameson applauding the villains, calling them the real Avengers.
Imagine they aren‚Äôt in the movie
Plot twist, the sixth member of the Sinister Six is revealed to be Stilt Man
no appearance, but a tease and maybe something at the event with them being shown or announced
a line from goblin, a shot of ned peter and mj, doctor strange interacting with a villain, matt murdock being the shot after the logo shows at the end and a shot of each villain in proper costuming
Prediction: I'll have a more enjoyable theater experience if I don't watch it and go in as blind as possible but I'm a slut and will give in
Spiderman, no way home spotted mostly on world wide web, sorta.
HENSHIN!!! Japanese Supaidaman will appear along with his Megazord.
So will the trailer go live at 5:30 also or will we have to wait like 30 minutes for it to be dropped online?
I got 100 on the first 10 minutes of film.
Ha!
I think Tom‚Äôs Spider-Man is going to be really beat up by the end of this movie. Physically and emotionally. I think this is going to open the door for venom to bond with Peter, I‚Äôve kept telling myself now that venom is MCU how could we get the black suit since Tom‚Äôs peter doesn‚Äôt seem like he would be in a good place to bond. I think that the post credit scene might set that up in some form or another.
I really wish that Toby and Andrew will appear in the trailer, but i also have the shittiest luck, so i'm putting all my tockens on the no option.
Nah technically they were teased ü§®ü§®ü§®
Why even bother hiding them? The majority of people know they are in it and I expect them to be at the premiere and on chat shows before the movie comes out
A three second clip after the date card will ruin what would have been a great surprise in the theatre.
A full shot of three peters‚Ä¶. Oh my
They‚Äôve gotta tease TM and AG surely, they‚Äôve gotta give us something‚Ä¶ right?‚Ä¶ RIGHT?!
The bridge will be the main character
No way home trailer 2 get released today
No Toby and Andrew in the entire movie.
They're not in it bros. We've been betrayed
When does it come out and where can I watch it
I've got a lot riding in this, RPK, they better not be in the trailer
everyone voting yes and partially is on some copium
It'll be focused on the villains.
Since he's officially canon, i'd pop huge if a duplicate spider man was really Takuya Yamashiro
Although we're pretty much all aware that they will be in the film I really hope they don't and save it for the film premiere.
If anything just keep using footage of doc Ock and green goblin but no Tobey or Andrew.
I doubt tickets will be on sale tonight. Usually showtimes tend to start leaking a few days before they go on sale around me and I‚Äôve seen nothing yet
Paul Betanny and Ralph Bohner will appear.
Miguel O‚ÄôHara cameo.
ITS UP CANT WATCH WAITING DOR MY BF
they are not in the movie
I know they've been caught and exposed to be in the movie. But I'm honestly starting to feel like they aren't lol
They won't be in the movie. It will be 3 Tom Holland clones.
So are the unicorns like bitcoin?!
Teased :)
Peter Parker (Tom Holland) will have a cameo in Doctor Strange: No Way Home.
No Matt Murdock
Also Jimmy Kimmel's Kraven finally gets revealed!
Wait tonight? What time !!!?? Vbb
A Ramones Song will play during the trailer.
Honestly I‚Äôd rather they show Daredevil. I want him officially confirmed more than I want the other two SpiderMen confirmed
They won‚Äôt be shown, but the trailer will end with fade to black and a mix of the Raimi and TASM themes
Kraven the hunter
Groo the Wanderer cameo.
Write it in stone. If Tobey and Andrew full on appear (as in, appear with their face, not implied presence) in the trailer, I‚Äôll buy a ticket to NWH for the first person to tell me I was wrong.
I just can‚Äôt see them not being teased at all, but the closer we get to it, the more I think Sony wants to really promote the villains and have that alone be what gets people interested. But at the same time, even casual audiences will start speculating, ‚ÄúIf the villains could cross over, why not the heroes?‚Äù and start predicting Andrew and Tobey on their own.

I predict enough of a tease to fuel that speculation even among casual fans, with the full reveal in theaters
Tobey and Andrew are in it. What will I win?
Gonna say yes
Whens it going to drop people think?
No,why would they drop the money making sht in tonight‚Äôs trailer?
Multiverse of madness teaser after NWH trailer
[I predict this will be the trailer](https://youtu.be/tT55pvSe9R4)
We'll see all the villains and a cheeky glimpse of Murdock.
I‚Äôll take Option 4‚ÄìI think we will see them in an extended promo that announces tickets are on sale a couple weeks before the movie, but not before then.
Is the event live streamed?
Bridge
I think I‚Äôll lose lol!
If Andrew is in the movie, he'll be the one to save MJ or he'll tell Peter about it before the final battle and that will put more pressure on peter to project his MJ
When they ask for doc ocks name in the trailer, theyre actually talking to one of the other spidermen, either andrew or tobey. They‚Äôre like in shock/joking around that they have the same name
Max bet on a miles morales appearance
How the fuck did I miss this
No cause they aren‚Äôt in the movie, I honestly think that everyone involved in the movie has been telling the truth. And that we have brought this madness upon ourselves
![gif](giphy|kaZtgEF9U4rRNRRSua)
Wasnt it supposed to come out 7 minutes ago. RIP this sub.
Option D- neither will appear cuz they ain‚Äôt in the movie
they will cameo in the movie but will appear more in Doctor Strange MOM. Strange will need their help
People here throwing temper tantrums because Sony didn't show the other Spider-Men
I hope not. Im sick of being spoiled by trailers i can easily wait till the 17th to see both of them
Either A&T are not in the trailer, or all of Daniel RPK‚Äôs cred will be lost tonight. I‚Äôm, probably stupidly, gonna bet RPK knows what he is talking about or else he wouldn‚Äôt have made the leak. If I‚Äôm wrong, then I‚Äôll never believe him again.
No other Spideys 

visual of the sinister 5 (6?) together 

Im picturing them slowly descending on a beat up spidey. end of trailer.

Draws in the casual fans without giving up the biggest spoiler.
***MAN***
Predictions Tournament

Across BOTH episodes?

Everybody not picking 10+ is trippin.

Edit: I tried to warn you, bro.
Hawkeye creates the multiverse.....bro
Bro. Gonna be 3-5 times, bro. I just know it, bro.
3, take it or leave it bro
Thus far I have lost every single round of the tournament and I intend to maintain that strong streak.
![gif](giphy|1BFFVB9WvJNUnBIYVy|downsized)
it would be nice if next time these predictions were opened sooner. as a person from europe (and basing the following off of other comments' timestamps), this was posted at 4 am and predictions (understandably) closed at 8 am when the episode dropped, not really giving much time at all...
Am I missing an inside joke here or
Someone pls enlighten me, what is this predictions tournaments I've seen recently?
Three predictions?! Y'all are making it really hard for me statistically to maintain my losing streak on this G-D tournament.
Bro idk
Not the post credits scene m, but the final scene of the actual episode.
Bro bro bro. It‚Äôs gonna be a whole futzin episode from the perspective of Pizza Dog, bro. Maybe some flowcharts and diagrams of that good boy solving that old Bro‚Äôs murder. That good boy gonna catch the scent on a white pant leg and slowly look up to see futzin Fisk‚Äôs imposing frame from dog‚Äôs eye view, really stepped in it this time, doggo bro.
Isn‚Äôt Fisk a Spider-Man villain not Hawkeye?
It‚Äôs gotta be enough but not enough to where it becomes annoying.
Bro
I don't know about the next episode, but I'm pretty sure at some point before this show is over there's going to be a big showdown between the Tracksuit Mafia and the NYC Larpers.
The watch has something to do with Avengers Tower. If it be some sort of function of the actual building or a vault of some sort. I think Fisk owns the building.
4 will be Yelena in post-credits.

Kingpin will be saved for big reveal in 5.


Mark it.
Probably next week or another hint
I got:
*Venom in the movie
*Green Goblin actually has accurate face and trailer and pics were misleads
*Strange is Mephisto
*Mysterio return
There's going to be 10+ bros the second a single tracksuit shows up.
And that say my brain is .retarded.bro I'm ada here.i haven't talked to any body in 20 years about any thing .that's real.guess I never will just my finger it's been talking a lot I can't feal it any more.bros face is numb. Www Hat about my fingers and brain..
If Fisk is going to make an appearance in tonight‚Äôs episode it will either be at the end for the cliffhanger, or will be in a post credit scene.  My gut tells me cliffhanger
 Bro 3 times, bruh 2 times and the n-word 1000
Considering the pacing kind of seems to match with that of TFATWS, I could see Yelena's episode being a  "Madripoor" level side quest around Episode 4, possibly setting her up as a potential ally for the finale. It'd make sense for maybe the episode to be Kate dealing with learning more about her family being evil while Hawkeye tries to deal with Yelena.
Does new episode come out midnight eastern?
Can‚Äôt read all of the first option üòï
I'm going to predict that he's end of episode teaser. Not post credits but also not fully in it.
i feel like he‚Äôll appear either 5 or 6 but not 4. maybe in 4 it might be a post credit tho
Brooooooo
Didn't Forbes release spoilers for Infinity War and Endgame?  If yeah, then I totally expect them to release spoilers.
I think episode 5 of Hawkeye will tie in with this movie somehow
I can't see the page!... bro
Red, because he‚Äôs really MEPHISTO!
Hawkeye and Kate Bishop appears
Kingpin will show up in episode 2.

Probably in a cliffhanger ending or tease.

Edit: Oh wow, we‚Äôre dogpiling downvotes for a prediction I accepted as debunked? Is that necessary? Come on guys, chill.
Bro culture is toxic as hell
Easily more than 10 times because they are almost arround ten it numbers and also they add bro in each sentence.
No
I made a bet with my bro she‚Äôd show up in episode 5 bro. My bro said episode 4, bro. So now you telling me no one is going to make or lose money bro?
I don't watch TV I have no idea oh I only watch TMD or whatever I just started watching animal videos and fear Factor how long was that show on and that other one Wipeout that would have been fun I wish I knew that was going on yeah I thought Joe Rogan wasn't like a wrestler comedian guy I didn't I didn't even know about fear Factor pretty gross man where the hell did they get bins full of bull balls and I hope they didn't hurt those rats those rats are cool those are Lab rats they're the best pets you could have

It‚Äôs gonna sound stupid but I hope it‚Äôs not Bobbi because literally the day before the rumors of mockingbird entering the MCU started, I told my friend it would be so cool to play mockingbird in the MCU since I‚Äôm an aspiring actress.
Ummm she's on IMDB
Kat Dennings on Evan Peters filming scenes: "I wasn't sure what was going on. While we were shooting, they cloaked him in [this] thing, so no one could take a drone shot of him getting out of a van, or whatever it was. It was a big secret, but, They pulled it off."

You know what's crazy? I don't think Mandos "baby yoda" character ever got leaked out. Weird how a quicksilver appearance in this show ended up leaking out through text and image before the release of the episode.
And somehow Charles Murphy knew he was on set a year back. I wonder how
I‚Äôm kinda sad it got out anyway. I feel like because of it people had a deflated reaction and now all they talk about is whether Magneto or whoever will show up. Like, damn, way to be unimpressed lol
All this so he can play Ralph Bohner
Wow, the comment section of this post aged badly.
If it's to mess with Wanda why not just get another actor? Why specifically cast Evan Peters when everyone knows he's played that character before? Personally, I believe he is Quicksilver and he has the memories of the MCU Quicksilver because Wanda is essentially the "script writer" in this sitcom world until we find out later that Agnes is actually pulling the strings.
Do we know if he's in other episodes? Also spoilers are irresistible but I think we would all agree here if the video of him didn't leak beforehand it would have been so amazing seeing him for the first time in that moment
And all that for a stupid boner joke
Well unfortunately word got out.
Yeah, they did all this work to hide Evan Peters because he's playing an obscure villain like Mephisto or Nightmare. He's definitely not playing Multiverse Quicksilver in a series that leads into Multiverse of Madness /s
B O H N E R
All that for a boner joke
I can predict upcoming comments here

'yOu kNow WhO eLSe wEArS a CaPE?'

'mEpHIsto'
They go through all of that trouble keeping him a secret only to make him a random townsperson named Ralph?
These comments did not age very well lol, but I still think that they did not just bring him in for a dick joke lol
Yah really pulled it off alright
What a fucking let down, Boner
All that for a boner joke lmao
Look like Marvel went to great lengths to conceal their massive bohner reveal. 

Eh hehehe.
This comment thread aged like poor milk
i‚Äôm still annoyed after almost a year.
I think all the devil/Mephisto and nightmare references are red herrings. THEY ARE TROLLING US. And it‚Äôs working. Lot of meta tv stuff in this show ‚ÄúKick-ass?‚Äù but the real beauty is how they‚Äôve managed to fuck with all of us and keep us interested in the show along the way. I really think the simplest plot is probably the path for them here despite all the head fakes.
Damn, y‚Äôall really believe that headshot was still a headshot after the hex came down, and not a S.H.I.E.L.D file on someone in witness protection? Laughing at his own name was a pretty heavy handed hint that things still aren‚Äôt what they seem.
I love how the comments are that he is the Quicksilver from foxverse or Mephisto

Sadly those comments didn't age well since Marvel only called him for a dick joke apparently

wtf I have still not gotten over that
The most liked post of all time‚Ä¶
Yeah all that for a boner joke. Edgy.
So are we still thinking he‚Äôs actually playing Fox Quicksilver 

Because the episode made me think it‚Äôs supposed to be MCU Quicksilver with just a different face. He has all of MCU memories and hasn‚Äôt really referenced the FoxVerse 

It would be very cool if he was... but so far Just seems like a very meta marketing casting. Cause they knew the hype Evan Peters would cause for the role. And it worked
This makes more funny the fact that the spanish VA of Quicksilver leaked the fact he was gonna comeback to dub the character again in Wandavision and he got fired because of that.
Well that was a takeout. LOL
If only they were this careful with the Avengers movies or even Spiderman No Way Home lol
This will be lost in the sauce, but one might argue that there isn't a hidden villain, but it's just Wanda herself. To the initiated, we all know she's wearing the original Scarlett Witch outfit, but to the uninitiated, (ie my wife,) she's dressed like a devil. Red leotard, red cape and red "horns"...

Edit: fucking autocorrect
I dont know how they could use his character to join the Xmen and Avengers universe.

They made it clear (again) in the most recent episode that Wanda and Pietro were brought up by Eastern European parents not Magneto (although, yes they could go back and say that they were adoptive parents) and even more crucial, its been made clear that they were not born with their powers aka theyre not true mutants.
bohner.
Explains a lot...... ü§î
Guys just got off the phone with fieg dawg, it‚Äôs not xman quicksman
Perhaps a similar tactic has been pulled with two particularly Spider-y dudes
As someone who only sees this sub because it's on the front page, it's funny how many people here are complaining about being spoiled about this moment. 

Some real r/leopardsatemyface shit.
Looks like this Pietro and Wanda do have something in common after all. They both caused a civil war, Wanda with the Avengers, Pietro with the fans lol.
Kat definitely didn‚Äôt have to worry about this as she was already confirmed
first
I think the big bad (Nightmare / Mestipho) is possessing different people and just hopped from Agnes into Pietro, which might explain her sudden shift in awareness.
I don't see why it's such a stretch if he's Fox QS or not given that we've been told Foxx's Electro and Molina's Ock will both be new renditions of the characters despite presumably coming from the multiverse. I'm assuming these castings are more meta than anything and Feige still wants total control over these characters.
I really hope it's all the xmen crossing over and not just Evan, i love all those movies somuch it would be really nive to include them in mcu rewatches
I'm definitely in the category of believing he's a Multiverse Quicksilver but not the Fox Quicksilver. At least if he's from a Universe that we haven't seen, Marvel can write/find ways/reasons for him to stay in the MCU instead of going back to his own Universe. Maybe in his Universe, Wanda died so now he's got a reason to stay because he has her. If it is Fox Quicksilver, It'd be odd for him to not return to his Universe with all his X-Men.

I'm hoping Marvel are gonna keep Evan Peters & Quicksilver around after WandaVision, Using the Multiverse & explaining why he doesn't want to return is a good way to explain why he wants to stay in the MCU Timeline.
Any guesses on how they cracked open the multiverse? I mean we all know that's where things are heading to but this subreddit particularly deals with leaks and theories and I haven't read a theory on quicksilver's appearance apart from him being Mephisto/Nightmare.
It‚Äôs wild that I had no idea, despite being online all the damn time
Does this mean they will have a scene together üëÄ
So much effort for a boner joke.
I think it‚Äôs interesting nobody talks about the fact that Ralph was still in the Hex when we discovered his name is Bohner. We all know people in the hex have fake names. I‚Äôm thinking Bohner will return and we will learn who he really is.
Ralph Boner
Hi
I think he‚Äôs the ghost of the school shooter from the first season of American Horror Sorry, he somehow broke out of being stuck in the house.
I think Kat Dennings is gonna end up as the love interest for Evan Peters in the sitcommy world.
I wouldnt be surprised if he was loki.. the comment about vision dying twice was just the right amount of Loki mean.. maybe hes hiding and it ends with Owen Wilson showing up like "Well take this one."
What is the reason for the ‚Äúthis‚Äù to be in brackets? What does that mean?
I think this should put a lid on the mesphito shit
It seems extra but it is disney so
So can we assume that Darcy and Pietro do not share a scene in the next episodes?
aaaaaaaaand it's the most upvoted post on the sub
Uh, scanning the comments‚Ä¶

Kat hasn‚Äôt appeared with him, yet. 
Who is he really?

And who was in witness protection that went missing?
"Cloaked him in this thing..."

You might call it a ... hex?
I think its pretty wack that people want to spoil shit like this even before it was filmed
I'm starting to think he won't stay for the rest of the series. I wouldn't mind, as long as we get an explanation of why he showed up. But I guess we'll know for sure next episodes
It‚Äôs gonna be hilarious when this isn‚Äôt quicksilver from fox
Except if you googled the cast weeks before the show ever premiered it would tell you he was in the show
They did well hiding it... Except when it got spoiled/leaked a week early :(
I still think agnes is the sword directors wife and vision didn‚Äôt actually take her out of the spell last episode. She was the only one on the edge of the town who responded to him, so I‚Äôm thinking she did that to trick him into leaving the bubble
They did all that and it still got leaked
I appreciate that they used the original actor in the flashback to age of ultron. I hope both are back, but at least they are not erasing the original.
I wonder if Wandas molecular rewriting of everyone entering the field will be the cause of mutants
No they didn‚Äôt... we knew the spoiler months ago üòÇ
100% they are most likely doing this (or have done this) for Tobey and Andrew in SM3.
... but the rumours were there for weeks so really not that much of a secret, I would be surprise however if they pull a magneto on us.
Ok here's my theory... Mephisto is possessing different people at different times like Ralph and the Mailman and yeah, he is probably currently possessing Evan Peters Quicksilver but that doesn't mean he isn't the real x-men quicksilver. I think Mephisto is manipulating Wanda's mind and making her merge the X-men universe and the MCU.
Evan Peters In The Parent Trap.
IMO I think Doctor Strange sent him to get info
A Mephisto cloaking device.

Even though it already leaked, that felt so incredible to watch.
I thought the white sanctum was unfinished CGI but nope, it's just the wintery sanctum...
That fucking Dualshock ad

The pumpkin bomb with Dafoe's laugh and then seeing Doc Ock sent me back to when I was a kid, I can't fucking believe this is happening.

That next trailer with Tobey and Andrew will break records. This is wild and I love it all.

LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!
It‚Äôs OK, /r/marvelstudiosspoilers. 

You can rest now.
The subreddit arc about waiting for the trailer has finally ended

cue the arc of waiting for the second trailer
HOLY FUCKING SHIIIIIT

Now i am at peace with my life‚Ä¶
Man, I'm actually speechless, but the thing I'm the happiest about here is how, unlike with Venom, they actually have a definitive date in the trailer and they seem committed to bringing it to us in December. I hope, seriously hope, it stays that way. I can't wait much longer for this movie.
You could see Flash with the blonde hair. Another W for the leaks.

Also, the Sanctum still not being fixed bothers me lol
Lol all those people trashing Daniel in the other thread have some crow

ok but are we not going to talk about dr strange in a hoodie
Where have I seen this trailer before‚Ä¶looks familiar haha. Cannot wait!!

I thought it was bold of the Marketing Team to just have the official trailer be Kevin Fiege holding the recording of the recording of the recording that leaked yesterday up to the camera with a scowl on his face.

This looks like it will be a fun movie, I‚Äôm excited.

Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was such a massive part of my childhood and seeing him on screen again? Ngl, I teared up a little. Welcome back, king.
HOLY SHIT IM GONNA CUM
This is infinity war all over again, 10 minutes and already 125k likes.
Guys!! Someone pointed out on Instagram that the outfit Holland wears at the end of the trailer is exactly the same one Tobey wore when he was fighting Harry in beginning of SM3, with similar hair styles!!!.üòØüòØ
https://www.instagram.com/p/CS8OoB3MqLf/?utm_medium=copy_link
That dude with his head out of frame in interogation is Matt Murdoc.
The random PS5 ad tacked on at the end made me laugh.
Didn't one of the leaks say that Tom looks at some Halloween decorations and gets inspired to visit Strange cause of it? I feel like I read that before and we see it here in this trailer too
I'm probably wrong but I'm laying down my cards now: That's not our Doctor Strange. Dude was way too shifty and felt too mischievous and out of character. Betting that the end of What If? will reveal our Strange got trapped in the multiverse and that Evil Strange usurped his place in the prime timline.
YO CHECK OUT 2:21, YOU CAN SEE PETER'S HOLDING THE CUBE, IT LINES UP WITH LEAKS THAT SAY IT'S THE KEY TO THE PRISON WHERE THE SINISTER SIX ARE BEING HELD
Anybody else looking forward to when the MCU does the scene with the Spider-Mans pointing at each other in this movie?

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! My first Reddit award!
I'm afraid I just blue myself.
DOC OCK LOOKS SO GOOD

Where's the theory gang that says that is not the real Dr.Strange.
DESTINY HAS ARRIVED
So "Guy in a white shirt and a black tie slams papers in a table next to Peter" is Matt, yeah?
Trailer thread has over 100 comments in mere minutes on this sub. This movie making a billion dollars easy, regardless of the pandemic.
(when you roll a nat20 on your charisma check)

Peter: ‚Äúhey can you cast a spell on everyone in the entire world for me to make my life easier‚Äù

Strange: ‚Äúsure why not lol‚Äù
You know what I‚Äôm really excited for?
Watching this trailer in IMAX on September 2, right before Shang-Chi.
Anybody notice Dr. Stange‚Äôs lack of cloak on the subway? Could it be on spidey?
That glimpse at the black and gold suit tho and the city collapsing on itself holy shit
THAT WAS THE FUCKING SANDMAN!
It feels so weird to actually see these characters in something official for the movie, the last 8 months of starvation and desperation in leaks for this film have made the actual product so dubious and mythical to me lol.
This subreddit now that the trailer dropped

![gif](giphy|L6EoLS78pcBag)
Does anyone else think strange is acting weirdly out of character in this trailer?
That guy in the white suit is totally daredevil right

EDIT: wait can anyone make out what Strange's mug says is that one leak true
Anyone who denies Tobey and Andrew are in this movie at this point is just trolling
I can‚Äôt believe John Krasinski is playing Uncle Ben
Gotta be honest, the cafeteria at 1:16 looks a lot like the one from the first Spider-Man (Tobey)

Edit: or it may be a FEAST clinic

DanieRPK saying the dark figure that Peter looked around at is Lizard.
"wE nEeD tO StOp LiStEnInG tO dAnIeLrPk"

Jesus Christ people. Shut the fuck up for once in your lives.
This gonna beat endgame for trailer views isn't it?
My guess is that, when Doc Oc said hello Peter, he actually was speaking to Tobey's Spidey, but this trailer edit Tom's Spidey in the scene instead, to save that for surprise in the theater, Marvel always edit the trailers to avoid spoiler like this.
I think people might be overthinking the Doctor Strange thing. Yes, it's reckless but remember Strange is very cocky and arrogant. We also didn't see the whole scene and how he was actually convinced to do it. Gratitude towards Peter? Guilt over what happened to Tony?

Still might be Mephisto or evil Strange or whatever but I think it's just Strange being cocky af and then Peter messing up the spell.
Sony‚Äôs Sinister Six plans are FINALLY going to happen lmfaooo
OUT, IS IT?!
Ayooo was that Matt In the white shirt in the interrogation room????
things in [this leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/p9azz2/tales_from_the_mod_queue_the_unverified_and_maybe/h9whk0d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) that were confirmed by the teaser trailer:

* the media saying that spider-man ‚Äúhypnotizes women‚Äù (apparently it‚Äôs something important for later) + peter and mj having a deep conversation at the rooftops

* blonde flash

* halloween decorations that remind peter of dr. strange

* snow at the sanctuary

* wong warning that the spell was dangerous and telling dr. strange not to do it. stephen winks

* the ‚Äúoh for [image of a fox] sakes‚Äù mug!!

* peter interrupting dr strange while he‚Äôs casting the spell which leads to the multiverse happening

* peter ‚Äúholding‚Äù the cube while dr. strange pushes his astral form out
So, I noticed Marvel/Sony already pulled a "Hulk in Infinity War" altered scenes in the trailer. They changed the shots of the Integrated suit from the leaked trailer, to the regular Iron Spider suit for the official trailer.

Wonder what else they're altering
I started that trailer at 11% battery and now my phone is fully charged.
I already said this after watching Loki's finale, but...

Feige, you son of a bitch. You did it. You actually managed to do this.

Sinister. Fucking. Six.
I‚Äôm calling it, none of the scenes with Dr Strange are what they appear to be. I do think all the multiverse stuff is correct but there‚Äôs something off about how they edited those two conversations to make it seem like their spelling out the plot. 

So I don‚Äôt believe anything about how this trailer portrays the dr strange premise.
![gif](giphy|46zGs8IUfhHQHGvspb)
Peter: "Oh no MJ, Ned and May will forget I'm Spider-Man"

Me: "Cast the spell and then tell them again you fucking dope"
2:26

Something lunges at Peter from the magic prison, I assume!
Besides the fact there‚Äôs no way Doc knows that MCU Peter is Spider-Man already, he‚Äôs looking more to the left when he says ‚Äúhello peter‚Äù. Next shot we see MCU peter looking in the opposite direction. It‚Äôs gotta be Tobey he‚Äôs talking to
HWHDHHEBSHDYS
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|xT8qBeEqnpdMbIbtVS)
Wong just heads out and be like, "I'M with Shang chi now"
The scene of Doc-Ock and Peter are definitely not the same scene. Holland Spiderman is gearing up to defend the bridge from Goblins bombs and Doc-Ock is probably speaking to Tobey Spiderman
![gif](giphy|L6EoLS78pcBag)
Peter: ‚Äúwill you erase the entire world‚Äôs memory for me?‚Äù

Strange: ‚Äúlol sure kid‚Äù

Wong: ‚Äúwill you get me a sandwich?‚Äù

Strange: ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE GOBLIN LAUGH OHHH FUUUUUCCCKKKK!!!!
- He's using the black and gold suit against Electro

- He's wearing the black and gold suit while he's running through F.E.A.S.T

- Strange is holding that cube, which 100% confirms that big plot leak now. 

- I creamed.
Dafoe still has the laugh in the bag.

>The problem is you, trying to live two different lives

I hope the rumor that Tobey gave up being Spidey, and Garfield gave up being Parker, and that Tom decides to "go halfway" and let people know he's Spider-Man isn't true.

I want a bit of a downer ending where everyone forgets. Everyone. So Peter's back at square one with his friends, Aunt May, the Avengers. No more Stark Tech. Etc. Totally on his own from now on so we can get some classic Spider-Man stuff if they do another trilogy

That laugh. That was a Willem DaFoe laugh. Holy shit.

This is just absolutely surreal. Now that the trailer is officially released, this all feels even more real than it did an hour ago or even yesterday. I can‚Äôt wait for December.
"Hello, Peter."

*chills*
Dammit this trailer came out at 3.40am, way too early for me. And yet somehow my body randomly decided to wake up ten minutes later so I could watch it.

I have never been more grateful for insomnia :)
Hearing Dafoe's evil laugh hit me with a wave of nostalgia

&#x200B;

Sorry Palpatine... I think you're laugh has been beaten
One of my friends just saw the same trailer that we all did and said "This doesn't connect to the Raimi trilogy, because Tom Holland's contract expires and he's leaving the MCU." The multiverse denial is so unbelievably strong and stupid. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Isn't the cinematography way different than the previous films?? Looks too good
MY HOT TAKE: the final bad guy is‚Ä¶Dr Strange.
It was a honour, ladies and gentlemen.
Guys, Stephen Strange is the guy that ruined his own life because he was talking on a phone while overspeeding a car. He's always been arrogant and hubristic. I think we can all give the "fake strange" theories a rest
Oh btw to anyone who remembered some leaks on here about a mug that says ‚ÄúFor Fox Sake‚Äù it‚Äôs there. Strange is holding it in the trailer.
I like that we're gonna be getting more of the fun city bending stuff from Doctor Strange. I'm really interested to see how Peter maneuvers around that.
I like how the meme about MoM for so long has been "Dr Strange cleans up the multiverse after Wanda and Loki" when it turns out Strange messed up worst of all
Guys quit coping, that‚Äôs the real Strange.
I love how they advertise the discord as the fucking leak discord, yet when you talk ahout the OFFICIAL trailer they just fucking ban you. Avoid this subs discord, they're fucking idiots. T-Minus 5 minutes til the downvotes,.
The Ancient One watching this go down as a force ghost:

![gif](giphy|KzK7rcQ0R8xhYPxFHm)
My only query with the premise of the film is why would Strange risk the entire multiverse to help everyone forget Peter's identity? There must be (are) a million better ways of doing it...

It's like his arc in IW doesn't matter, he's still this arrogant, self-assured guy who does what he wants

Also hype to see Wong again
I loved how they basically confirmed Matt Murdock without actually revealing him
Guy at :31 is clearly looking straight ahead, not down when he‚Äôs slamming the files on the desk. That + the half rolled sleeves? It‚Äôs fucking Matt Murdock lads.
Spider-verse/ one more day seems to be the story base

Did they seriously put a ps5 controller ad at the end of it?
When‚Äôs the next trailer out tho . I‚Äôm sick of waiting
THE MUG SAYS FOR ü¶äSAKES
Yall are all shocked about a goblin laugh WHEN THERE WAS LITERALLY A PUMPKIN BOMB
I'm one of many who kind of grew up with the OG trilogy...seeing OG Doc Ock at the end gave me all sorts of chills and nostalgia in the best way. I will argue *Spider-Man 2* is still one of the top five comic book movies of all time and fight anyone who disagrees!!! (please don't hurt me...)
I just hope we see Raimi JJ demand that somebody bring him Spider-Man, only for three of them to drop in.
Calling it now‚Ä¶ The guy slamming the files down on the desk during Peter‚Äôs interrogation might be Matt Murdock.
Why would Dr Strange cast that spell?
That subway train looks really dangerous! If only they had someone who could stop it from going off the rails ü§î

Hello üÖ±Ô∏èeter
I can‚Äôt believe the Evan Peters post still beat this for the most upvoted post of all time xD!
Why is E.I.D.I.T.H not mentioned in Spider Man NWH in any of the trailers or leaks?
It seems so out of character for Strange to do such a spell, specially considering how strict he was with Magic in Infinity War and Endgame

Edit: What if he's a skrull and that's why he can't fix the snow and he agrees to do that stupid spell for Peter even though the real Strange would Never. 

Anyone in the MCU can do magix but they can suck at it

Spidey and Strange are even fighting each other in another shot
Now that we've officially seen Molina reprise his role as Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 (or a similar universe, at least) as a result of something related to the Multiverse, I just want to say how utterly stupid the Quicksilver fake-out was in WandaVision.
First
To those who aren't familiar with the comics and are saying Strange is out of character.....Dr.Strange cast the same EXACT spell in One Moment in Time, which is the followup to One More Day.
This is the craziest day in mcu fandom, shit is bigger than endgame

Man watching this in HD with finished CG is just like the first time again. Holy fucking fuck

Peter: üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
It's offical, When I see Green Goblin in his Power Ranger suit fighting Tom Hollands Spider-Man, I'll die happy.

I think the scene with Strange and Peter on that Train is probably where the multiverse is breaking and they are on the train from Spider-Man 2 where Tobey and Doc ock fought. Maybe that‚Äôs how Doc Ock and Tobey come into the MCU! Anyone else thinks so??
Stephen holding a "Oh for Fox's sake" mug was a funny detail
At the 0:41 mark, is that Flash behind MJ in blonde hair?
daaaaaaaaaaamn i jsut learned this. in wandavision there was a calendar with a circle or heart on a date and the date says august 23. sneaky huh
White and black tie is matt murdock confirmed
so the guy in white shirt at 0:25 has got to be Matt Murdock, right? I mean the posture and hairstyle looks like him, plus it looks like he has glasses on
There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs our MCU sacred timeline Dr. Strange. Guy is way too reckless.
Jesus y'all salivated over this trailer and sorting by controversial is just "Molina's cg looks awful" (no it doesn't), "there's too much going on" (it's the multiverse baby).

Like ffs you're already complaining lol

This trailer was so hyped and is dope asf, all these downer comments are written like it's the same person posting them.
OH BOY YEAH!!
LETS GOOOO
The trailer has come and in 5 minutes, so will I.
This sub owes DanielRPK an apology.
Is it Dr. Strange from what if? Check the train scene  https://ibb.co/dgNmZfZ
That cube Peter has when Strange knocks him into astral form - that was mentioned in a leak right?
Still can‚Äôt believe this movie is actually happening
So Dr. Strange and Peter messed up and caused problems‚Ä¶ hmmm but wait is this still planned by Kang though?
New image from Spider-Man 3

Tom Holland is finally looking his age
Notice the black dhalia necklace?
Petey and MJ just had an intense round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, with Ned officiating. This shot shows them looking up at the scoreboard to see if Pete played his paper before the buzzer went off.
Jacob lost a ton of weight, I'm happy for him! He looks great!
If Peter is the one on the run, why is MJ the one looking disheveled as hell?
They are looking at the multiverse portals opening.
Jacob wearing a Letterman jacket. Maybe he took up football to explain the weight loss?
What was all the fuss about Tom being asked to wear a wig and he said no way. His hair looks fine, so why would they need a wig??
Trailer soon PLEASE lol
Ned is wearing a jacket that says M. M is for monsters university. Who know who else is a monster or monster-like? Mephisto. Ned is Mephisto. There, i cracked the code. Your welcome!
That house looks abandoned... There's orange lighting on them from the front.. Peter is hiding in an abandoned house after his identity leaks, MJ and Ned are still living their normal lives (based off Ned's letter jacket and that one set pic where Ned and MJ were working at some store). In this scene Ned and MJ visit Peter and Dr. Strange pulls up unexpectedly through a portal to tell Peter how he wants to help him with his identity and needs his help to deal with the multiverse.
I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve got images for this before any kind of look at Shang Chi and Eternals.
From Tom Holland‚Äôs Insta
I think they are in doctor stranges[the sanctum ](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/94/29/f2/9429f211064d0782167961032912b4ac.jpg) place since the flooring and walls matchup
Ok but Ned‚Äôs pins. We need to *enhance* üëÄ
In a church?  Get ready for Charlie Day Daredevil.
Is Ned wearing orange? Like, u know, HOBGOBLIN.
Amazing
Hey at least we got stills so am  not complaining
Mephistopheles?
Shirt probably hinting at the court scene.
Is that room frosted over?
You know, he kind of looks like Nathan drake here lmao
[That shadow apparently looks like Doctor Strange.](https://twitter.com/adambarnhardt/status/1364357830015410181)
MJ looks like their Drug dealer lmao üòÇ
MJ looking like a homeless person
I bet they‚Äôre looking up towards Tobey Maguire.
Spider-Man: Home Wrecker
Lighting makes me think it's Strange or one of his portals opening up. ü§î
How does Ned have a letterman jacket ? What sport could it be for?
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu8vLP2XMAUvRcP?format=jpg&name=900x900](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu8vLP2XMAUvRcP?format=jpg&name=900x900) 

floor looks very similar to dr strange sanctum
M on jacket, ned is mephisto confirmed.
Phone = Tom 
Wrecker = Andrew
Slice = Tobey
He‚Äôs got a *baby mustache*!
I fucking love Ned!
I mean i don‚Äôt but this that kinda scene where they are on the run and then while getting some rest, they hear helicopter blades closing in on their location so they all look up fearing for the worse and then the sound of chopper goes faint and they‚Äôre in the clear.
Why is MJ looking homeless?
They are all admiring Mephisto.
The shadow of either a really tall person or someone on a platform looking down at them..
Maybe they're seeing Tobey and Andrew swinging by üò≥
They're looking at another spiderman coming to beat the shit out of them for selling weed in a back alley
Commenting before this post gets locked :'(
Ned's wearing a blue and orange jacket, probably a subtle teaser of Hobgoblin since his costume has blue and orange has the primary colors
Also just noticed all the snow in the background, even frost on the walls. So this is def an abandoned building or something.
I think the necklace MJ is wearing is the one Peter gave her in FFH
You see that lamp? Definitely mephisto
Is this a bird? A plane? No, it‚Äôs *superman*
Ned is in Hobgoblin colors. Orange/Blue.
Is this a confirmed still?
Its the one above all ü§Ø
It‚Äôs going to be Home World isn‚Äôt it.
Wow, Jacob had a glowup!!
Okay
Why Z gotta bigger Adam's apple than tom holland?
That wig on Jacob Balaton really sucks in this image for some reason for me hahah.
Cast starting to not look like kids anymore lmao
why do they keep MJ looking like a hobo for? like they cant choose between over sexualizing and hobo? why cant she look normal? tf
Ye Gods get that poor girl a steak WITH POTATOES!!!
They look like there in a trailer for the newest smash character
Ib4 10 minute NewRockstars video
Spider-man 3. Drakes Fortune.
Ned went to Monsters University?
OH SHIT
I wonder who‚Äôs shadow that is?
Mephisto??
[deleted]
Man Tom looks Haggered
Does MJ have the Dhalia necklace on?
Can't wait.
Where is this from?
Never realized Ned wore a letterman? What sport? Can't tell what pins those are by zooming.
Is this before Jacob lost weight, or did he gain it again? He looked super thin in that selfie he posted last year. Way thinner than this.
Is this a set photo or an actual image from the film?
If Tom Holland buys a Jeep I'm going to freak out.
The new goonies movie looks amazing!
Peter going for a handshake while MJ goes for a fistbump

Kinda like Thor and Banner in Ragnarok
Damn still no eternals trailer huhüòü
MJ is wearing the gifted necklace from Far From Home.
Spidey potter is gonna be awasome.
In my opinion, it could be some sort of multoverse portal, or even one of Doctor Strange's portals. With so much speculation, it's hard to tell. All I know is that this'll be one good movie.
Every time I see Ned I am instantly happier
I prefer the old one
Ned always third wheeling it. Kid needs a hobby.
That shadow is definitely Doc Ock
MJ got that Marv from home alone look going on
Seems like the light of a sling ring to me.
Is it just me or does Tom Holland looks like a video game character in this image?

Ô¥æÕ°‡πèÃØÕ°‡πèÔ¥ø
Doctor Strange finds them and opens up a portal that will bring out both Spider-Men to team up with Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man. It‚Äôs in the script.
IS THAT MEPHISTO
Can't wait for this movie to come out!!!!!
Are we really gonna get all 3 spidey? They can also use that multiverse thing to introduce miles
TF they looking at?
I think they are looking at something, probably a crack in multiverse opening up in their reality............it would've fire.
why do they look like they saw Tobi and Andrew
They're looking at Mephisto obviously
The in universe Answer to why Ned is in shape is right there in the picture, he's part of his school sports team
That floor and furniture looks awfully similar to Dr.Strange's Sanctorum hmm.....
They're in the New York Sanctum and that's Doctor Strange's shadow reflecting on MJ. The floor tiles and the lamp match the Sanctum's foyer.
They're watching Spider-Man vs. Dr. Octopus in 3D
Spider man 3 2?
Spider-Man: Home Alone
You mean spider man 6
THEY ARE LOOKING AT MEPHISTO !!!
Look at the shadow of a head on MJ‚Äôs body. It‚Äôs Dr. Strange.
Hobgoblin Confirmed
That jacket is from Disney world. I know because I have the same one and I bought it there. Is dope
Definitely in the Sanctum right?
I thought Sony took it
I can't wait for this movie, I don't think I was this excited for endgame
Ned's jacket sleeve made me think that the shadow had 3 claws like a certain xmen hero
Getting ready for W Dafoe to give Jacob a glider
Hobgoblin
‚ÄúSpider-Man uncle ben ain‚Äôt home‚Äù
Spiderman:Home Wrecker
Why does MJ have to look like an old grandma in Russia? Peter loving some gilf action I guess...
Calling now that this scene is when they get picked up and go to space with fury.#hottake
Looks like they just paid rock, paper, scissors or drew straws...
In Holland ig he posted the movie tittle ‚Äúspiderman phone home‚Äù
Raimi vibes
Holy moly!
Dr strange just opened a sling ring portal in front of them that‚Äôs why the orange tint maybe this is where he first shows up in the movie
is it gonna be hard for them to keep the title secret?
Does no one else think this is Tobey‚Äôs apartment from 2 and 3?
Peter and MJ look concerned but Ned looks disgusted. Like "I can't believe a villian would seriously wear that" kinda disgusted you know
im thinking Phone Home is Andrew Garfields thing, cause he played that bubble burst game on his phone in I think his first movie. Home slice to Toby maguire because you know, pizza slices and Home-Wrecker to Tom Holland because he wrecked Vultures home by making him go to prison. Just a thought. 

And also I feel like the color has somethjng to do with each Spider-man version but Idunno
MJ looks like a Holocaust survivor
Why‚Äôd they make her look shorter than him when she is like 3 inches taller?
They are looking something...maybe Dr Strange ü§î
Official title is
Spider-Man phone home
I hope zendaya gets powers somehow.
Epic!
The set they are in kinda look antique, maybe 50's or 60's.

Are they time-travelling?
Why is her hair still not red :/
BUT WAIT WHY DID JACOB POST SOMETHING DIFFERWNT
They‚Äôre looking at Mephisto did anyone else do this yet
I'm sure this would have been already out if it wasn't for Covid
Or the Day after Tomorrow 2
The shadow on Peter and MJ kinda looks like Dr strange
I thought this was just posted for a second. I was gonna say this is late af haha
What are they looking at?
That‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs years old. I remember when Sony first leaked it. We think it‚Äôs Strange floating from the top. What say you.
But why? Any of this? Can we have more costumes or something? Like just make Mary Jane into a superhero too if she‚Äôs going to be SOOO involved
Guess people ere right, this is the scene in dr strange's house right?
Who is the dude in the middle?
Official Spider-Man: No Way Home Poster

![gif](giphy|O4IDyXlbeXwBy)
You've spun your last web, Sony-Pictures.

Had you not been so selfish, your poster's release would have been quick...
They definitely were like, "OH MY GOD, PEOPLE FOUND OUT IT WAS THE SAME ONE FROM THE BUS!! QUICKLY WE ONLY HAVE 2 HOURS TO CHANGE IT!!" lmao
HE'S GOBLIN

HE'S GREEN

HE'S GOT A HELMET

HE'S TOO MUCH FOR MR. INCREDIBLE

wait, wrong movie
Damn they put Green Goblin ALL the way in the back üíÄ
So RPK was right. Also Goblin!
And I'll say what everyone is thinking: Why wasn't this released with the teaser trailer? It doesn't show anything that wasn't in the teaser, and with the 2nd trailer coming soon (probably next week), it feels strange to release this poster now...
so they just straight up threw gobby in a poster without a trailer lmao
100 comments in 5 minutes??? 

guys idk if this movie is gonna do well or not with these rookie numbers
I know everyone is hyped for tobey and Andrew (I‚Äôm too) but if I gotta be honest man I‚Äôm so pumped to see Dafoe back as the green goblin, my favorite villain of all time(with the joker) and he was just perfect casting.
Naw that‚Äôs actually hilarious it‚Äôs was literally just the bus picture üòÇthis man rpk is sick for not telling us lmao
it's real

![gif](giphy|gKfyusl0PRPdTNmwnD)
This is also confirmation that the movie won‚Äôt get delayed here in the states.
No lizard reference? Believed we seeing 4 reference of the villains here.
Okay so, we see Ock‚Äôs tentacles, Electro‚Äôs lightning, Sandman in sand form, and FUCKING GOBLIN JUST VIBING
YOU CAN SEE THE GOBLIN GUYS
![gif](giphy|SF9Z0shNT07T2)

Hopefully marketing will be full steam ahead now.
[deleted]
GREEN GOBLIN LETS GOOOOOO
YOU'RE TOO LATE SPIDER-MAN! THE DISNEY-SONY DEAL HAS ALREADY BEEN LEGALIZED
Omg guys do you see the tentacles? Huge Easter egg. In my opinion this confirms Doc Ock. I know I know, but just have an open mind.
So no lizard on the poster
Sony is trash at marketing lmao
DONT TELL ME THATS MY BOY WILLEM DAFOE IN THE BACK
Trailer next week then? Please? ü§°
That‚Äôs our glider!
![gif](giphy|1j8Or3f6mbxjXOtFWn|downsized)

me analysing every detail of this poster
![gif](giphy|lS7rq0J0QDULN8k68z)
I guess they had to edit the poster a little more since it got leaked on buses ‚Ä¶.WHO THE FUCK CARES THIS SHIT IS FIRE
They have everyone but lizard lmao
GOBLIN IS THERE AND HE'S WEARING THE MASK

DOC OCK

ELECTRO

I THINK THATS SANDMAN BEHIND PETER

Our poor boy Lizard got left outüò≠

Sony saw it leaked and were like: shit, might as well change it and tease some of the other villains, they already know they're in it
Honestly, as far as MCU posters go, this is actually interesting. Disney's MCU posters have more solid composition but they're also mostly just characters in static poses. Here we have a dynamic image that focuses on the powers Spidey will be contending with and teases some awesome fights will be in this movie. It's a welcome change of pace from "and this acto-- uh, character will be in the movie so go check it out if you like them!"
Looks like a [high res version has been sent to the press ](https://twitter.com/KirstenAcuna/status/1457547667966365701?t=d2BO6i1QJUJHvyyBFBs6PA&s=19). Someone please post it soon lol Twitter and Instagram make the quality look so bad
Poor Lizard :(
If u look closely u can see Tobey and Andrew passionately making out!! But you have to draw it in urself and probably be closeted a lil bit :/.

All jokes aside I kinda dig the minimal marketing tbh.
After all this time

![gif](giphy|n6xe7RntgjFyo)
Sony is awful at promotion. You do the subtle hints at Electro and Sandman but just show Goblins whole ass body. This poster is only cool because of the context of what it‚Äôs showing but aesthetically it looks weak.
I‚Äôm certainly whelmed after seeing this
People are literally freaking out for 10 pixels of green goblin which everyone here already knew was in

Imagine when we see the 3 Spidermen together
![gif](giphy|oW4csEbiMzVjq)
They 1,000% don‚Äôt mean anything, but the embers look like spooky faces in the bottom left and right corners
HYPE !!! Also does anyone spot a Lizard reference ? I only see the other 4.
Green Goblin almost gets struck by lightning and dies
Hmm I think that Doc Ock and the Green Goblin are gonna show up in this film, just a feeling.
Poster before the trailer is the funniest shit
HELLO MY DEAR
Ok but I still don't get why they waited so long to release this. It doesn't reveal Tobey or Andrew like so many people were predicting.
Anyone else feel like all the first posters for the Spider-Man man mcu movies are always better than the final one? Like the the far from home official poster is garbage
Everyone but Lizard. 

Wow
OUT AM I
Maybe it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs the only one we actually saw in the trailer, but they are REALLY hyping up doc ock, considering goblin, who everyone is assuming to be the ‚Äúmain‚Äù villain, is just in the background
We all talkin Goblin but there‚Äôs also sand
We are definitely getting a trailer tomorrow or the following monday. "Tickets on sale now" at the end. Im buying 12 tickets for the whole squad
Theyre not even trying to market Lizard lol
GOBBY üëÄ
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
![gif](giphy|IdCMQK3As2y8Fj7ZMU|downsized)

LET GOOOO!!!
Sony should‚Äôve hired BossLogic for the marketing like they did Far From Home‚Äôs blu-Ray release lol
https://i.imgur.com/URhNLNo.jpg 

Anyone else notice the text box that‚Äôs been left in every version of the poster I can find?
Looks like Goblin will have his mask after all. Far too iconic not to include it in the movie, glad they did.
/r/IllegallySmolGreenGoblins
THOSE EYES

THOSE HORRIBLE YELLOW EYES
My theory is Tobey and Andrew are in a hypothetical wider image. The 3 Doc Ock tentacles in the poster are reaching for all 3 Spideys
This looks like something BossLogic would make. Really cool and well done, but using only pre existing assets cause they don't have access to unreleased ones.
Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro, and Sandman! No Lizard :(
I don‚Äôt know what it is but this poster is especially terrible. So busy, so much happenings looks like it was put together last minute. At least it‚Äôs not the 5 faces in the centre with an explosion in the foreground.
RPK deniers in shambles
[Here's a better look at one green boi.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDpGFcdXEAkMIRK?format=jpg&name=large)
This is me attempting to manifest a new trailer within the next twelve hours to coincide
"Yeah, fuck the Lizard, get him off the poster"
GOBLIN HAS GOT THE MASK. YES!!!
Sony again with their üóë posters lmfao

The one on the bus with mirror dimension NYC looks better
GOBLINS GOT DA HELMET
Nobel prize otto, Nobel prize
Okay, so they took the poster that was leaked, removed the Iron Spider arms, and added Green Goblin, sand, and lightning. It's not an amazing poster but it's not bad either.
So we got spider man on a destroyed building. Facing off against doc ock. With sand man and electro in the back.

And the poorest quality image of green goblin I‚Äôve ever seen.

Doesn‚Äôt match any leaks of his new design and just sticks out like a sore thumb
I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs a pretty lazy poster but seeing gobbie in the background makes me incredibly excited
![gif](giphy|tVTnEqzAxxmyA|downsized)
I really hope this movie isn‚Äôt shit.
Guys‚Ä¶ after careful observation I think we can concluded that Spider man will be in the next movie for sure.
Wow I'm shocked at how minimal effort this poster is. It looks like a fan made poster with how poorly done it is.
‚Äúi cAn‚ÄôT beLiEvE tHeY‚ÄôRe fEaTuRiNg gObLiN wiThOuT HiM iN a TrAiLeR‚Äù

They literally had his pumpkin bomb and laugh in the last trailer, why do so many people on this sub like to fucking play stupid, i dont understand
Plot twist: Thunderbolt Ross shows up in the middle of the fight and arrests all three Spider-Men and all the villains for violating the Sokovia Accords.

"If you want to fight Spider-Man you should have registered with the government."

Everyone gets led off in handcuffs.
Docs Arms look rusty here ü§î I guess being at the bottom of a river would do that
This is awesome
THIS SHIT IS DOPE AS FUCK
IT'S NOT THE BUS.
Did someone forget to add goblin in and just threw him in the back with a quick PS job?
GOBBY WITH DA HELMET CONFIRMED FUCK YEAHHHH!!!! plus if you really zoom in you can see his snazzy new purple scarf thing!
It was the fucking bridge poster all along
[deleted]
is that mephisto on bottom left?!
So‚Ä¶ a worse version of the Bus poster with a tiny jpeg of Green Goblin (from the Raimi film, it‚Äôs not his design for this film‚Ä¶) just pasted in the background to ‚Äútease‚Äù even more. The main villain‚Äôs first official reveal is a little pasted on thing of the wrong version in the background of a poster.

[Getting serious TASM 2 vibes from this honestly](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/green-goblin-teased-amazing-spider-man-2-poster/)
Bridge: The Movie.
I see references for doc ock, gobby, sandman, and electro. But where‚Äôs lizard?
Spiderman:The Disappearance of Tobey and Andrew
Just wow... This poster is straight up "learn how to Photoshop" quality. It looks like someone just googled goblin.png, pasted him in and turned opacity the 45%
"the Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the water spout, down came the Goblin and took the Spider out!"üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
Wait, this comes out in a month?
Credit is where credit‚Äôs due, this is the best MCU Spidey poster by quite a large margin lmao.
Green Goblin and yellow lightning. Yeah it's practically the bus poster but at least it's got SOME new stuff. Hope this isn't the final poster
WAIT A MINUTE THATS GOBBY IN THE BACKGROUND

HOLY SHNOTS!

If y'all go onto the official No Way Home Twitter account, go to the poster, and zoom in on Goblin, you can see a strap across his chest. He's wearing the suit that has been leaked all over the internet.
This poster sucks. It looks like it was put together by Spider Man 3 Eddie Brock....Topher Grace confirmed. The one from the bus looked much better
![gif](giphy|Q94Bw5xaTs7b3mrNrS|downsized)

Why'd ya spill yer beans Sony?
At this rate the trailer will probably come out *after* the movie
HD Resoultion Pic :   
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDpKcP3WUAMlf0D?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
I'm sort in the background myself
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout. Down came the Goblin and took the spider out!
Ahh. Can‚Äôt believe this is going down in roughly 40 days.  I‚Äôm at close to IW/Endgame levels of hype right now.
Shiiit. Anyone, else feel the need to watch Raimi and TAS films again?
I prefer this over most MCU posters tbh
That's just lazy. Wth is that poster it still looks fan madeüòÇ
I noticed each of the villains has a 'thing' in this but can't seem to locate Lizard's. Obvs the tentacles, gobby, sand, electricity what did I miss?
Since spidey mastered his spider sense fighting Mysterio, he should be able to put up quite the fight against all of them. Homecoming Pete would get wrecked
Them releasing a villain heavy poster I feel like is gonna be a pretty big clue that the trailer is gonna focus heavily on the villains. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre ‚Äúshowing‚Äù Goblin, albeit from a distance and kind of fuzzy, before the trailer. The villains aren‚Äôt gonna be the reveal like they were in the teaser. I imagine the trailer will be less focused on the FFH fallout this time and instead is gonna be much more about all the villains and possibly even explain why they‚Äôre in Tom‚Äôs universe. I‚Äôm thinking we definitely see Electro and probably Norman unmasked with a more visible Lizard reveal and probably Sandman. Marvel usually saves big reveals for after the title is shown in the second trailer, such as our first look at Spidey in the second Civil War trailer. I‚Äôm betting the last shot before the title is Tom‚Äôs Spidey in the new black and gold suit taking on all the villains. Then we see ‚ÄúSpider-Man: No Way Home‚Äù possibly with a ticket sale reveal and then cut to black and we hear Strange or maybe but probably not Tobey or Andrew say something like ‚Äúyou look like you could use some help, kid‚Äù or maybe something less lame and then we see a shot of Tom reacting to two shadows.
So I guess trailer tomorrow?
at least green goblin‚Äôs in the background
HE HAS THE HELMET DAMNIT
Green Goblin in the back, the lightning and the sand is cool but it's the same damn poster ffs. Wish they did something a little different.
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|oit9mu0v5LqzC)
Where‚Äôs lizard?
You know I'm something of a poster child myself
Green goblin has his helmet, YES YES YES YES, i cannot wait for this even more
anyone know how to find a 4K/not grainy as shit version? the one on Twitter is pretty rough
Next trailer better show the goblin and the rest now
Oh my god it‚Äôs beautiful. I can‚Äôt wait to see Dafoe as Goblin on the big screen again.
i unironically like this more than the posters for the other two sm films, and a good portion of marvel films

a lot of posters are just face spaghetti and look really ugly , i think this one is pretty sick
I see an elongated head on Gobby.... HELMET CONFIRMED!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I know this movie has marketed itself but really it seems like Sony isn't putting in much efforts lol
I see 4/5 villains but I don‚Äôt see the Lizard. Can anyone point them out to me?
Should mean trailer is soon right?
Damn, Daniel was right. I was beginning to believe he was false.
So like, why not release this with the official Teaser back in August? Why is there a tiny green goblin at the back? lol and why on a Sunday evening?  Sony are so weird god bless them.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the poster.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why wasn‚Äôt I told?‚Äù
Imaging the bus poster was fake but the people who made the posters said ‚Äúnot bad let‚Äôs just add a few thing‚Äù
Everything about this film is getting leaked before we get it officially from Sony. Including the Poster . I'm afraid tobey and Andrew will be leaked if they are not going to show up in the trailer .I definitely want to see them in HD üò¢.Sony put them in trailer (money shot).
No offense to marvel/sonys graphic team but this looks like a highschool photoshop class project üòÇ

His Greatest Battle Begins üòâ
Doc Ock, Electro, Sandman and Green Goblin (!)!!!
This poster is an official confirmation of all of them!
Finally!! And, after all this waiting.... I don't like it! Lol.
It is really cheap imho, and the covers used for the Empire Magazine were really better.

Marketing with motion blur _again_. If you own the movie, surely you have control over what gets published! What is going on?
I like the poster tbh and besides it‚Äôs just a poster It‚Äôs not marvels strong suit
fr Green Goblin looks like the Hag from Dead by Daylight here with the posture
The fact that this isn‚Äôt a fucking floating heads poster is so nice. Glad to see at least some artistic intent here
Is there any hint to Lizard that I'm missing here? I see the obv Doc-Ock, Gobby, Sandman and Electro.
Is that sandman reference?
Sounds like there will be only 5 multiverse villains: Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Sandman, The Lizard, and Electro, so we will not be getting a full sinister six. Yet, still holding out that Rhino from TASM 2 shows up, or Venom or Mysterio becomes the sixth member. Venom though will probably have a credit scene in No Way Home to be teased as a villain to fight Spiderman in a fourth film.
I wonder if Doc Oc is in this movie
Don‚Äôt want to be a hater but that is such a let down. The movie is almost one month away from being released and that‚Äôs all they can give us? I mean I get that they are trying to keep everything under wraps, but at this point just give us a nice poster and trailer.
Big fan of the motion blur on the claws instead of them being crisp
NOW THAT'S A POSTER
this looks fanmade n rushed but i love it
looks dope
Really awesome to see Gobby in the background. I‚Äôm cool with this poster, this is nice
MY GOD... FINALLY
down came the goblin and wiped the spider out
![gif](giphy|3oz8xGGKVSSJDV0mYM)
Gotta think trailer today/Monday then
It‚Äôs a cool poster but I‚Äôll even join in the chorus: Why wasn‚Äôt this released with the teaser trailer? It doesn‚Äôt show anything that wasn‚Äôt in the trailer.

Also, happy to see that, while the movie has been delayed in a few foreign markets, it‚Äôll still get released on December 17 here in the US.
Lizard must be hiding in the shadows
At this point, I‚Äôll take whatever I can get
Anybody know how I can acquire one of these posters?
Lol Sony saw how pissed people would be if it was just the bus poster so they said "throw in some Electro lightning and a one-inch Green Goblin".
I like it. It's leagues better than some of the posters we got for HC and FFM.
![gif](giphy|fG1wZ6SQtfCFy)
Otto‚Äôs arms, Sandman‚Äôs sand storm, electro‚Äôs lightning and Green Goblin in the background, why didn‚Äôt they tease lizard?
you know i‚Äôm something of a last minute edition to the corner of a poster myself
I don‚Äôt get why everyone is constantly slamming why this movie isn‚Äôt being marketed differently. Does it really need heavy marketing at this point despite us wanting official looks at things
I liked the one on the bus better, the one that had the city spinning in the background with the Doctor Strange mirror dimension effect
This is a teaser poster. Where the real one at?
Wouldve preferred spiderman and villain faces with a blue/orange gradient background tbh :/
Kind of weak for a poster, but that‚Äôs par for the course in terms of MCU posters. 

Love how they‚Äôre just like ‚ÄúFuq it. Show Dafoe‚Äôs Goblin and let the internet go wild‚Äù üòÇ
-Green Goblin (sky)
-Doc Ock (from below)
-Electro (sky)
-Sandman (behind Spidey)
-Lizard (reflection in Peter‚Äôs mask)
-Mysterio (clouds and slight formation of Doc Ock tentacles make a helmet formation kinda when you look at the poster as a whole)
What the goblin doin
I love that they‚Äôre not completely redesigning Green Goblin. His armor is my favorite.
Back to formula?
cool now drop the trailer
I guess the MCU Spider-Man movies will never be known for their posters lol
Green goblin in this poster reminds me of when we saw Vision for the first time in the background of the Age of Ultron poster
If you're already disappointed in this poster, just wait until the 2 Spider-Man is just being teased in the trailer soon.
Is that another Spider-Man in the reflection of the tentacle
Why do I feel like they would be filling up those empty spaces in the background with characters in the future i.e The Lizard, Sandman, the other spideys
I dig it, this is the next Endgame level event for sure
Watch Peter just use a stark orbital strike on all of them üòÇ
WooW teaser postee aftee months thank you sony! You GREaT!! /s
they did gobbie bad. what the hell is that tiny ass goblin? the disrespect
So, we got:

1: Sandman
2: Doc Ock
3: Electro
4: Green Goblin

I‚Äôm guessing the one who creeped up behind Parker and the one that Happy saw was 5th >!unless if there‚Äôs six. That would include either Rhino or Lizard from TASM or Venom due to the post credit scene of Let There Be Carnage!<.
[removed]
Please let bring me sandman with same actor or Jamie Fox any! This poster i see some lighting and also some sand
One detail I find interesting that I haven't seen others mention here is Ocks tentacles are different to the ones in the bus poster. These are the Spiderman 2 bronze design whereas the other poster showed them having a different design and silver colour
Goblins are REAL
Judging by what's on the poster, it's safe to say that the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro are all going to be sharing the big bad status.
Villains implied or showed in the poster:
Doc ock
GG
Sandman
Electro

Sony: this poster is the best we can do...
To me it seems as though theres another spiderman in the bottom left corner of the poster?
Interesting Tom‚Äôs in the Iron Spider suit in the poster. I was already thinking it, but feeling pretty convinced that one is getting destroyed this movie. Likely on the bridge.
Here is a better look at Green Goblin‚Äôs new look: https://twitter.com/kirstenacuna/status/1457547198053244937?s=21.
[They literally forgot a PNG rectangle what are Sony designers on when making these posters](https://twitter.com/eternalsnick/status/1457546744565174273?s=21)
[deleted]
This looks so boring and uninspired. Poor Goblin looks like he was just thrown in there
Wow a main poster with the mask on... That is impressive
Left down corner, MEPHISTO CONFIRMED????
[mephisto confirmed!](https://imgur.com/a/0Y9RJwL)
Does this poster represent only 4 of the villains or am I missing Lizard somewhere?
DEFOE GOBLIN!!!! HELL YEAH BACK TO FORMULA!!!!

![gif](giphy|5y9gbdVCtYATK)
where Tobey? where Lizard?
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!
Maybe with the villains teased in this poster maybe they might leave the Spider-Men as the final surprise in the trailer? I hope that's what happens.
GREEN GOBLIN BABY I‚ÄôM SO FUCKING READY FOR IMAX
I see Gob, Dock, Electro and Sand-Man references, where`s Lizard`s at?
So glad to see that they kept the Goblin‚Äôs helmet.
First look at Green Goblin
More teases of Sandman and Electro
Good look at Doc Ock‚Äôs tentacles 
Expected more üò¢.. atleast all 5 villains on the poster..hopefully they release another poster after the 2nd trailer with clear looks of all 5 villains .
This is going to one of the highest upvoted post in MSS
I love looking at things I have never seen before! Thank you Sony!
I want you inside me.
ü©∏
Am I blind or am I missing the Lizard tease? Seems odd that all of the other villains have something except him.
"Fuck it, just put the freaking Gobling in the back, just make it tiny"

Someone at Sony's probably.
![gif](giphy|lAwSWN4O67oGc)
My favourite spidey villain is back üñ§

![gif](giphy|KyNaxDMelNFk4zqjdH|downsized)
Best MCU Spidey poster we‚Äôve had. The Homecoming one with him lying down is awesome‚Ä¶ but this is fucking awesome. Wayyyyy happier for this rather than the bus one
Hey, at least it‚Äôs better than the Far From Home posters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What if's... Spider-man - No Way, Home!?
This movie is about to be such a nostalgic trip.
Can we please get the trailer already, the hype is through the roof FFSSSSSSSSSS

I'm glad we got confirmation Gobby's gonna have his full suit at least
The rubble in the bottom right looks like the lizard‚Äôs face from TASM
Well, I was wrong for assuming it'd be the bus poster...but it's really not that far off.  If I wanted to go all tinfoil-hat, I'd suggest that Marvel Studios got their marketing team to throw this together to compensate for the leak.

I think this is an improvement over the leaked poster, though.  I like that they incorporated the lightning for Electro, the tentacles for Doc Ock, the sand swirls for Sandman, and Green Goblin is floating in the background.  I wish they'd kept the city background folding in on itself like the bus poster, but its absence isn't a big deal.  It's cool and nicely put together...but it's not mindblowingly hype-inducing. (At least, not for me.  Your mileage, of course, may vary.)
Not a great poster but I‚Äôm just glad we finally have one
So..... Trailer tomorrow?
this makes me think we won‚Äôt see a new trailer anytime soon lol
[deleted]
really digging this poster actually. so claustrophobic and threatening.
Pretty lazy poster but man just give me everything No Way Home
We find out that instead of Dafoe it's actually:

![gif](giphy|D88mPGrW4oWxq)
Is it just me, or is that an old image of Gobby?He‚Äôs so obviously shopped in and is minimised all the way at the back so we can‚Äôt see any details. The poster looks messy imo.
It‚Äôll be cool seeing Sam raimis Norman and Otto and sandman (mabye) meet each other
Trailer incomiiiiiiiing
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|Y6r3h0fShzAac)
this confirms all but four villains. where is lizard üëÄ
So in the end, are there really gonna be only 5 sinisters?

The sinister five?
Green Goblin in HD
[Green Goblin HD SMNWH](http://imgur.com/gallery/795J32Y)
It‚Äôs not even a new shot of Spider-Man lol
Honestly just happy this seemingly confirms that Goblin has his helmet on at some point in the movie  tbh
Doc Ock, Green Goblin‚Ä¶Sandman and Electro references as well.  

Why not reference Lizard somehow then as well? Lol.
well, that was..
Bottom right of the image - is there a face there, or am I just tripping? First I was thinking Ultron (which I know, makes no sense) but it kinda looks like Lizard's face, as if his presence on the poster was kinda implied by this blurred thing
Seeing Spidey face off against the Sinister Six is gonna make me nut
I like it.
Hopefully we can get pizza time next
this violates every composition rule taught in photography and editing
The glider!!!!!!!

We had no words about it!!!! So happy now it's a fact that Goblin will use it!

What is interesting, is that he looks like he wears his mask...
Too bad it wasn't mickeys ears he was ripping off.
![gif](giphy|JApxkdelkzBIY)
Leaked Image from Episode 9

For those curious, this was part of the screencap that we saw confirming the runtime.
Why am I getting Spy Kids vibes...
Speaking of camera angle and placement, it almost appears as if half of this picture has been photoshopped to remove people standing behind the twins.
[deleted]
This looks like an official still, so if its a leak I think it's the episode thumbnail 

But I said this in another post. If someone has access to the episode and can tell us how long it will be, there's bound to be a few people with access as well who will be a lot more generous. Pics and summaries will come out before Friday. You can guarantee that
the fam vs agatha?
imagine if billy and tommy age up during the fight to help that would be insane
The Incredibles have joined the MCU
Ready to see the twins kick some ass ü•∞
No WAY she goes into the final fight without that dope costume, and if we're going straight into it I wonder how she'll get it unless she loses and goes back in for a rematch (with Strange?). 

I have no idea what to expect, it's fun.
I don‚Äôt think they are going to age the boys again just my opinion.
PLEASE LET WICCAN USE HIS POWERS FULLY
oh shit
I have no choice but to stan.
This is the best family in the MCU.
I really hope that Wanda has her new Scarlet Witch for most of the episode. I need to see her and Agatha face off with that thing on! It's gonna be so epic!
Ahh the kids are safe
I just have a feeling that Quicksilver will be in this shot, I wouldn't be surprised if he's standing behind the Twins. Man, If we get to see the whole Maximoff Family working together & fighting Agatha...... Imma bust.
Please don‚Äôt kill Vision üò© They‚Äôre the only entire superhero family in the MCU.
Fuckin prepped for this battle royale.
So somehow the boys have to be freed. I wonder if vision does that. Who are they fighting? White Vision and SWORD? Or perhaps Agatha and Quicksilver?
Why is Vision pink?
Looks sick but also looks legit what do you mean leak?
The kids looks so cute with those superheroes poses oh my god.
Someone's edited out of this image because of the camera work, like someone's standing behind Wiccan and Speed, has to be Quicksilver
Ladies and Gentleman, I give you the MCUs first superpowered family.
What the f....
*Where is Peter? Is he safe? Is he alright?*
This looks interesting!!
My mind immediately thought of [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUW7tAF5D4wGvu76z3vJ0dOYRYi_zpEUXhkQ&usqp=CAU)
Looks like someone was edited behind the twins. I‚Äôm no professional but the angle seems to be off if there‚Äôs not a 5th or 6th person behind the twins. But still, great pic!
They probably photoshopped Quicksilver out of there. Just look at that huge empty space between the twins
I know it makes a cool pic but why does tommy have his hands up? He has super speed. There is no reason for him to have his hands up.
We THE INCREDIBLES now!
I need more Quicksilver
Can‚Äôt wait to see Peter I mean Pietro fight!
seeing wiccan makes my heart happy i really hope they age up and become young avengers eventually
So clearly Vision is going to save the kids at the start of the episode.
They‚Äôve photoshopped someone out of the frame. In front of Vision, behind the twins 

Probably Pietro 

Anyways... I would love it if during the fight it also transitioned between eras
Maybe this is shortly after Fietro gets freed from agatha‚Äôs control and joins team Wanda, which is why the camera work looks like someone was edited out of the shot who would normally be standing behind the twins
[deleted]
Come onnnnnn Pietro, where are you??

This show has so many leaks my god
I like the leaks we‚Äôve gotten so far because there isn‚Äôt much detail and they just build hype. Idk if I want the full finale leaked for me. 

(Yes I know what sub I‚Äôm on)
Looks straight out of a Disney Channel Original movie, lol.
I hope against all hope the four of them will pull through but it seems very unlikely, unfortunately
Man I just want to see a leaked image of doctor strange in westview
It doesn't look like they're facing off against an actual threat (like White Vision/Sword/Agatha/whoever) to me. To me it seems it's more likely that they're looking at Monica or Peter. This seems like it could be a scene where Monica becomes an ally.... or more likely it's Fietro and we might get the big explanation here (whether he's Fox-QS or a fakeout). Also Vision looks a lil too pink here lol.
Vision‚Äôs color looks like Barney
It makes me sad that we can't see Fietro here
Got dem marriage rings on
Wiccan and Speed gonna kick some ass!!!
Already???
I‚Äôm still hoping that the twins age up for the final fight. It seems like they aged themselves up in episode 5, so maybe they‚Äôll do that again to fight Agatha/White Vision/Mephisto (obviously)
Looks like Wanda ¬¥s arms suffered from her fight with Agatha 

Maybe that‚Äôs why her scarlet witch costume got long gloves
I have a theory. Someone asked sookie if what shuri was doing had any payoff and she said yes. I think that they are going to revive vision but the kids will get trapped in the multiverse. I think ending the show in a downer note without any semblance of happiness is terrible. Yes Wanda needs to let go of her baggage and come out as a stronger woman. Maybe hex vision morphs with white vision and he breaks up with Wanda leaving the possibility of them getting back together again in the future. Wanda deserves a happy ending, people with depression and mental health issues deserve a happy ending
IT‚ÄôS MORPHIN TOIME
Someones gonna catch them hands
Is it just me or does vision look a bit different, like his colors are different. Usually he has a more red color on his face but now it‚Äôs more pink/purple
Looks like I downloaded the wrong Incredibles
Maximoffs Assemble!!
They are the new Power Rangers
aww
My heart is so full. Look at them!!
gonna be cool as fuck to see the family fight together
Wanda looks like a real mom here lol
Does any else see the discoloration on Wandas hands? They look kind of withered
I hope Wanda gets to keep her family somehow. She deserves some happiness after all she's been through. Cant wait to see how this ends!
vision with da ring
Definitely feels like some sort of leaked promo thing otherwise I'm not sure why it would have the branding there
Wow! This is insane! Can't wait for next friday!
It‚Äôs gonna be cool to see the little guys battle with their powers, but man I‚Äôm hoping they either grow mid battle to their teenage selves, or they‚Äôre losing and Wanda yells at them to grow. 

I know they‚Äôre going to be their teenage selves at one point, I‚Äôm just hoping we get to see them in this episode.
Tommy looks like he's about to throw them hands.
My favorite thing is everybody is rocking their comic colors.
The universal parking lot is so recognizable at this point that it completely breaks the immersion for me üòÖ
Wanda: this is our home.


Vision: then, let‚Äôs fight for it.
It‚Äôs going down boys !!
Major Incredible‚Äôs vibes and I‚Äôm all for it!!!
to whoever is leaking these photos... if you‚Äôre getting them from the disney+ site then take the end bit off the direct image link (it should say something like ‚Äú&withLogo‚Äù or something). it removes the logo.
Tentatively running into Monica and Pietro. Tense but not malicious.
PIETRO ??? üòûüòûüòûüòûüòû
@sookie and Pietro??
Getting mad Incredibles vibes from this.
Not enough red wiggly woos 7/10
My fav part of the show is the family unit, esp the twins. I really hope they will be together again in some form after all this hex is over
Tommy you're not magic you don't need to do the hand thing
This is giving me The Incredibles vibes and I kinda dig it.
Is it just me or is vision looking a bite washed out? Maybe he DOES merge with white vision üëÄ
I don‚Äôt know why but this gives off some incredibles vibes
Love Wanda's new hero outfit
Yo I need to see those little kids in action!!!!
This finale will fucking kill me i swear
Why vision certian scenes looks different and in this images as well, Is it Because CGI?
I‚Äôm getting a strong Incredibles vibe from this and I‚Äôm loving it. Next week, it is about to go down!
Is it leaked if Disney put it out?
Is it possible the real fight is everyone vs White Vision and Heyward? I think it can be said that Heyward knew Wanda‚Äôs magic could repower Vision with his comment when she sees Vision. Somehow he knew Wanda could create but Agatha didn‚Äôt until she went through these memories with Wanda?
Did someone say MCU Incredibles?
Wanda with the Mitch McConnell hands.
*Incredibles theme plays*
This is pre color correction right? Vision has the same pink tint as in all the bts from previous movies
I‚Äôm just pumped that for three episodes now her superhero costume is a cozy red hoodie
Marvels First Family
When you go out shopping with the family and someone ain‚Äôt socially distancing.
SO cOOL,,, Can someone please explain how are they going to explain the kids existence? I know in comics it is ok but in MCU how did she make babies with a robot?
why is vision pink?
Is it just me or does vision look extra pink-ish
They fighting white vision or Agatha
Shift into turbo
What happen to dottie?
Quick quedtion, did they mention anything about shuri copying vision's mind  from IW? Or it was notjing and some of us read too much out of that scene with shuri
Seems like they edited someone out from behind Speed and Wiccan
Yeah, like some others in the comments here said, it looks cropped/edited. I have a feeling there‚Äôs someone else that would be in this frame. Most likely Quicksilver and/or Monica, or maybe both.
Good to see Quicksilver going super speed in this photo
Guys I was rewatching the scene where Monica hears the voices in the hex and there is also jimmy voice that say "she was truly an inspiration.sorry" referring to Maria probably... But I don't remember that he say this phrase to Monica before she enter the hex....maybe was an off screen dialogue that then they added in the scene? ......
Look at lil Billy imitating mom's wiggly woo fingers. Love it! :) I can't wait for Billy and Tommy to appear in future marvels. I fell in love with them in this show. The young actors are great!
NOW SHOW US WHO THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAINST!!
This photo just confirms we need a live action wandavision family film! It can be like a marvel incredibles style film. It‚Äôs definitely a current untapped marvel story. If they don‚Äôt kill vision üò≠
I'm annoyed I always click on spoiler content now.
Calling it now... Hex Vision can't leave the Hex. He is going to transfer consciousness into Sword Vision, enabling him to leave the Hex. His mind stone also cannot exist outside the Hex. Also strange is probably going to show up to take agatha away
Wow peep Wanda‚Äôs hands- they look all old and pruney- prolly from Agatha‚Äôs vampire magic we saw beginning of episode 8.
Awwwweeee
Wanda: Well, dark entity behind Agatha, which may be Mephisto, Nightmare or Chthon, your end has come. This is the last Sitcom!

Vision: I'll cover you Wanda. I will defend you from myself or that Vision-shaped Ultron.

Tommy and Billy: Good Tommy. Attack Fietro from behind and I'll be distracting him with my magic.
I'm dying of nerdgasm. Billy's hands posture is kinda the same of Wanda. C'mon Wiccan, let's get magic!
There is so much to pack into a single episode. White Vision v facsimile Vision, Team Hayward/SWORD (what up?), Team Monica (is she still controlled?), Agatha (just how "evil" is she? will we get more of her background or are we just to take her coven's word for it that she was evil rather than rebellious?), Team Wanda and becoming "the SW", what are her kids?, maybe Mephisto or some other last second enemy/ally twist cameo. Like how? Even eliminating the last thing and pushing the nature of her kids off for a future story, that's *sooo muuuch* to cover in under an hour.

Edit: missing person, the rabbit/Scratch, QuickSilver too. SO MUCH!
I‚Äôm so confused, are the kids real?
Spring 2022

‚ÄúPage not found‚Äù
I just came 11/80,000 in the last tournament

This is my claim to success
What is this?
It'll show up, but at the very end, cause most of the show will be building up the mystery of "What the hell is going on?" and they'll tease the costume at the end.
I'm gonna say yes, whether it's Steven/Marc actually wearing it or him hallucinating seeing Moon Knight
Probably but a stinger.
cant say, got NDA'd
That‚Äôs my current college semester. Can‚Äôt wait for it to be over.
u/JohannSchmidt1943 good job with todays question thats a good one
Post was made a day ago but comments from 10 days ago. What
Did it really start with a continuation? It started with Steven waking up or do we count the sounds on a black screen?
I ain't gonna play, they fucked us in the last one.
They're not gonna show events from Steven's blackouts from Marc's perspective.
Yeah man
Confirmed
New Image of Mighty Thor and Valkyrie from Love and Thunder

According to Lizzie Hill from The Cosmic Circus, the goddess we see in the lower right corner is the Black Panther goddess Bast played by Akosia Sabet.
Padme about to argue why Anakin should get the rank of master.
Natalie looking so swole
Bast on the bottom right?
Choke me, Jane
Damn Janes got some Guns.
Yup my crush on Natalie Portman has resumed, she‚Äôs gonna kill it
Set design looks cool as fuck, Taika style.

Where is this though?
I fell on my knees

I like that armor for Valkyrie. It looks sort of futuristic actually
Tessa Thompson is pretty af
*We must stay focused my brothers, we must stay focused.*
Horny police, bonk me before I say something embarrassing.
I feel like Thor. I just rewatched both Thor and The Dark World this weekend and I‚Äôm at a loss of words looking at Natalie Portman. This movie is going to be insane.
Imma need swole Jane to tell the waiter they messed up my order
Is there any still picture where Nathalie Portman doesn‚Äôt look GREATER THAN GREAT?
nerdrotic on suicide watch
Tessa looks phenomenal, even better than in her previous appearances
Props to Marvel for clearly having black stylists. Valkyrie‚Äôs braids look damn good.

And Natalie looks like she will kick your ass üí™
Such a badass shot.
Mommy?
This looks cool. Looks like some sort of council.
![gif](giphy|K55exy0toWjQc|downsized)
I would let both of these women split me open like a coconut
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? So-
Damn Natalie is so fucking sexy with the muscles
im not gay but‚Ä¶
The Marvel personal trainers/nutritionists/pharmacists are geniuses. Never thought I'd see Natalie Portman swole. That woman was a wisp.
...I'll be in my bunk.
Damn, Natalie Portman looks buff lol. She looks great
Those costume are looking fire
choke me
Are they trying to hide a booster seat?
They both look so good! Their costuming and hair/make-up look amazing! I also love how vibrant the color grading looks.
[deleted]
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.
That‚Äôs KING Valkyrie, thank you.
Just choke me with those guns
Gosh, those costumes are clean. They both look great.
This is 100% on Olympus, that cornucopia screams Greek. Interesting to see Jane here but since we don‚Äôt know much about the plot structure yet, Jane may have been acting as God of Thunder for a while in universe.
Natalie portman gained more muscles for this than pattison for batman, respect, she looks awesome
I‚Äôm jealous of Natalie‚Äôs arms.
Damn... I do wonder if Jane also has the condition in the MCU. If so did they shoot those scenes before she looked like she could break the camera in two or body double'd it?
They both look amazing, really excited for this movie - but what is happening in this scene? Who is the person in front with... cat ears?
Ah, it's good to be King.
Better have EMS on standby when the movie drops ü•µ
Both look great!
And I thought Chadme was fake
A challenging wank to be sure.
Thor will be a side character in his own movie. Mark my words.
Natalie may have out-Hemsworthed Hemsworth
Can‚Äôt wait to watch that douchebag on YouTube rant about the M-She-U again with this as the thumbnail and him making an exaggerated disgusted expression again.
boink
i see grapes. where are the nuts?
Lady Thor and Lady Loki are so amazing I want a crossover! I also want them to join forces and be like EF these dudes and start their own mischief!
They thought we‚Äôd be to taken by the sight of Jane‚Äôs studly pythons that we wouldn‚Äôt notice the first look at Bast

I‚Äôve seen plenty of Natalie, Tessa, and Chris. Show me fucking Gorr
Yay strong female characters
oh no,"the council" again
Give me Gorr!
Love this
yo thats my favorite reformed slave driver turned king. Lets gooooooo
Yeah they absolutely knew what they were doing with this one lol
Natalie Portman got her arms in shape for this movie.  I love seeing that dedication.
Getting some Bast vibes from the girl on bottom left
Oh good some strong female characters at last :)
IS THAT S MOTHERFUCKING BAST AVATAR
Natalie out here looking like Chris Hemsworth from Thor 1. Flowing locks and all.
Noo
Wish Imogen Poots was Valkyrie‚Ä¶.
Valkyrie is sooooo hot
God DAMN, I go from crushing on Natalie as a repressed teen to crushing on her as an openly gay adult. It's like poetry it rhymes.
Headcanon time: this is at a god meeting to discuss gods being slaughtered. Gorr shows up to slaughter the gods dumb enough to get together in the same room.
Arms
Saw a guy commenting "M.she.U" just because of that picü§¶. They really can't compute the existence of a female character having more than 5 minutes of screentime
I think this might be my dream threesome.  Outfits and all.

Natalie Portman in Attack of The Clones was my sexual ‚Äúawakening‚Äù.   Hard to believe that‚Äôs a 20 year old movie, looking at her now.

Omg I didn't even notice that black lady she blended right in to the decor
Dang! Jane is ripped! üí™üèΩüí™üèΩüí™üèΩ
Damn, Jane‚Äôs got them gains!

Their costumes are amazing. Finally Marvel‚Äôs been getting the hang of their costumes lately.
Disappointed lesbian moms.
Didnt thor said whoever is worthy of mjolnir would be king of asgard (age of ultron)
I got a baaaaad feeling about this.
The lady rulers !!!  That‚Äôs way to go these days, ehhh ?
Missed opportunity for this film not to come out during Pride month. Gay af
Valkyrie was a scumbag who kidnapped people and sold them into slavery, where they had to fight for their lives in a Gladiator arena. She didn't even do it for noble reasons like surviving or feeding a family. She done it to buy fucking booze. 

Marvel has serious issue with writing characters. That's a massive red flag in her recent behaviour and theyve completely brushed it under the rug
Will this be the last Chris Hermsworth film? Is he going to get replaced too?
I hope Khonshu shows up in this movie, it would make a lot of sense for Gorr to come after him if he wants to kill gods, obviously don't let him die in this movie but I wanna see him. Not in an annoying 'fan wants cameoes' way, in a 'it makes sense narratively' way.
Meh
Holy moly she got built! Oh hi Mark!
I've had enough of Marvel's woke bullshit.
I gotta be honest, I don't like how they're calling her "Mighty Thor." That was always normal Thor's nickname - the amazing spiderman, the invincible iron man, the incredible hulk, and the mighty thor. And she didn't even debut in "The Mighty Thor" - her original series was just called Thor....so why? Is there something I missed that makes this make more sense? Is it just because the most recent run of The Mighty Thor was featuring her? That doesn't seem like it's enough to swap the nickname to a different character.
As someone who has never fully read any Marvel comics, how did Natalie Portman's character go from astrophysicist to goddess? Does this have to do with her traveling to Thor's world in the second movie? Because I tried to find an explanation and got more confused when it said that *cancer* gave her those powers?!

Or are we also going through the multiverse in this film?
Natalie is on that Disney roid game.
I wonder if Valkyrie and Jane are one of the couples, since Taika teased that Jane/Thor may not be one of the romantic subplots. We‚Äôll see!

EDIT: Three downvotes for small speculation on an LGBTQ+ couple. Really disappointing for a community I love.

I‚Äôd ship it
I'm in the minority....I think they added some prosthetics to those arms....
My proudest fap.
So they really going full woke with this shit huh?
I really hope she‚Äôs an alternate Jane. I can‚Äôt see how the current Jane would be worthy to be Thor. Look at what Cap had to do to use Mjolnir. I really doubt Jane has done anything even remotely substantial compared to cap. I trust the director, but if this is some woke shoe horned bs, it‚Äôll suck. She has to earn this spot, like cap earned the right to use the hammer. 

I do know Jane is a version of Thor in the comics, but Portman only came back because she wants the money. Valkrie would have been a better choice for the movies
*insert Wanda coming at them down the hall*
Portrait of the actors cashing in.
Natalie portMAN
Im just hoping for not another Captain Marvel incident...
Looks like she went on a cycle of CGI.
LMAO
Nasty
That‚Äôs not Thor. That‚Äôs Natalie Portman.
Ngl this looks made for tv.
Jacked arms on women is not a good look.
Female thor seems like a weird choice. Run out of original supet heros?
Shame Natalie couldn't be as bulked as Hemsworth's been all this time -- even Lizzie Olsen's talked about how just one of his arms is bigger than her whole head. :-o
So is this a multiverse where this is a female thor instead?
So if Valkyrie story involves her finding a queen is tht going to be Jane
I‚Äôm just glad Natalie got muscle for the role but I‚Äôm over Marvel, I just can‚Äôt muster up any excitement for the franchise anymore. Just wanted to say my first sentence because when it was announced she would be Thor I was a bit skeptical because of how skinny she was, I can honestly say I never imagined Natalie looking so strong. She now looks good for the character!
One of my favorite authors is a gay man who tweeted the pic of Jane and Thor that they released the other day and said ‚ÄúAm I bisexual?‚Äù I suspect this might just tip that scale for him.
Lol they‚Äôre gonna make Jane , Valkyries love interest and it‚Äôs gonna drive people batshit crazy
The MsheU is coming.
![gif](giphy|26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja)
I will never get how people can be excited for Natalie Portman being Thor

She was the worst parts of Thor 1 and 2, her personality sucks and would never be worthy enough to weird the hammer

It's just lame entirely
Hoo boy anti sjw part of the internet is not gonna like this movie.
what nonsense
I know we're trying to be all women-inclusive here but...Damn, they made them look masculine as fuck. Is the purpose to include women or to further accentuate masculinity as the preferred gender? Bc that's what it seems like everytime they put women up front in a film...not sure how it helps women or the feminine spirit, when we're still worshipping masculinity.
I just threw up a little in mouth...     More Mary Sue?  I just don't care abut Marvel's character assassination anymore.  The movies are boring and there is no other story, just:  girls are great, they do not need to learn or try or grow, they are just awesome...       Great lesson! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
Jane and Valkyrie are totally going to be a couple
Getting woke and going broke bahaha
So‚Ä¶a lot of you seem to think that those arms are real‚Ä¶. 

Yikes.
Marvel joined the woke party.
