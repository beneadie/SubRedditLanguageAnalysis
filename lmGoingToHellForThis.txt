BLM no longer needed after this helpful video

Man I love the classic Chris Rock
its intended to be comedy, but actually true
If BLM really cared about black people, they'd have this on rotate in every city in the country.
lmao ain't that the fuckin truth
I'll have to find the news article. Several years ago a black woman showed the original version of this to a group in a public setting and landed herself in some trouble.
He's not wrong
I've only been pulled over a few times, but once I had a passenger.  Even though he was white, he acted like the crazy passenger in the video.  I found myself doing sobriety tests and such, while he was yelling at them that whatever we are doing isn't their f***en bussiness while they had him doing them too (even though he wasn't driving.  He blew something really high on the breathalyzer, but I had zeroes.

When the police asked why I would be giving someone a ride that acted like that even though I was sober, I told them I only met him a few hours earlier and was only driving because I didn't want him driving when he was obviously drunk.  That was true, and the eventually let me go with no ticket.

Honestly, I think the police don't base it on race.  If you are white and get hassled too much, try following the steps in the video also.  The one time I didn't, I certainly got a lot more grief than I otherwise would have.
Probably.
This is so angering and annoying. Are you kidding me? Why am I seeing this here?

You aren‚Äôt going to hell for sending these videos, this is actually a legitimate advice. To think that these kinds of videos are the ones bringing you to hell makes me wonder what people think heaven is gonna be filled with.

Please, post this video in the appropriate place, like r/blm or r/racism , to educate idiots that it‚Äôs not your skin colour that gets you arrested, but it‚Äôs your actions.

And please send me the link of the post in those subreddits. I want to see all those fake-ass blm chanters getting so angry that such simple logic would make people realise how stupid the blm movement is
Common sense 2021.
He forgot ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let the woman drive‚Äù
Why is this on this sub?

Wouldn't it be better to stick both of your hands out of the window? That way the officer knows, or is that the same as putting your hands on the steering wheel, or is it worse?

Well, I agree with the girls on the right. It‚Äôs not your fault that your ancestors *may* have owned slaves. It isn‚Äôt your fault. Same with the one over. If your dad caused 9/11, then it isn‚Äôt your fault.
Why is this in this sub, this is 100 percent accurate
This shouldn‚Äôt even be on this sub. This is 100% accurate
True though

Where is the Care Bear brigade , Lolz!
Imagine at some point their shirts just randomly switch without any acknowledgement.
I'm amazed this is still on reddit.i know what sub I'm in, but damn this is too funny. Very true too. Ultimate in quality satire is funny because it's true.
when people try to prove they're not racist by being racist. woke people are miserable losers who want others to be miserable with them.

I hate this sketch because it claims it‚Äôs trying to represent ‚Äúunity‚Äù but it clearly has a singular voice. It‚Äôs less about middle ground and more trying to put words in a political view‚Äôs mouth and agree with those words.
This really demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the topic. That‚Äôs like calling pedos and pedo catchers the same cause they spend a lot of time on the same chat forums.
Damn white people being racist

That‚Äôs racist

EDIT: Hmmm...[OP seems to have a history with the cosplayer on the right in r/Pics](https://imgur.com/a/Jith4kt). I am wondering if that may have contributed to his permaban. Maybe he can post the reason for the permaban and sort this whole thing out.

Gotta love their obvious double standards. They‚Äôre gaping hypocrites and it‚Äôs always amusing watching them jump through mental loop-dee-loops attempting to justify their own bullshit.
You won‚Äôt go to hell for that but I will for asking‚Ä¶
Would it have been better if the one on the left did blackface? üåö
did this actually happen ?

And the usernames that posted those images.
So, is there some proof this happened? Or do we just trust the right winger who posted it, since they're always so honest...
The bad faith moderation of r / pics has been on full display for a while. A pic of a maskless Barack Obama got me permabanned while a pic of a maskless Greg Abbott hit the front page.
that fact that this is considered "ImGoingToHellForThis" content means the world is a joke
I‚Äôm getting a feeling @ninjaromeo has an agenda.  And it‚Äôs not for minorities.

I think it's more of a circle jerk
They really should rename that sub to LibCircleJerk - there is literally no Political discussions going on there just bashing GOP posters.
When did this sub come back? It's been too long!
Let them carry on with their obnoxious self righteousness. It‚Äôll only push people further the other way.
Yeah but they‚Äôre jerking black dicks
fuckin eh, replied to a person saying how if you're a conservative you deserved to die, so i called him an idiot so i got banned and they didn't even get a slap on the wrist.  
Admitted to being a conservative once, got banned.  
Said being liberal doesn't make you on the right side of history, got banned.  


worthless sub, it can't be true news if it only caters to one political leaning.
This made me rofl all over my bois Copter
you won't go to hell for the telling the truth.

<post has been deleted for misleading hate speech... by trans pedophilic admin>
it is a sad day when 9gag has more balls and freedom of speech than Reddit. tho it is understandable. this platform is muuuuch bigger and more mainstream and thus must play by the polite society-rules.

Still love the site for all its categories.
I am banned from 20 subreddits for actually stating facts and listing sources.
170 plus accounts banned/suspended, 3 plus shadow bans evaded, for the most part all you gotta do is if you get banned just log in and deactivate your account and make a new name on the same email.

Nike sued her for trademark infrangement.
The best part of this is that it was a bullshit story from the start:

> They happen to like to run barefoot during the official games, but use spike (track) shoes for their trainings. I got this information from their 5th District Coach.

> The young girl actually has one pair of training shoes but she, together with two other girls of the 5th district, prefer to run barefoot since they feel more comfortable and play better without shoes on.
