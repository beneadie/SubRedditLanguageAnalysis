John @Totalbiscuit Bain July 8, 1984 - May 24, 2018

This is tragic news, and we wish for the best for his family. 

There will be no tolerance for any insensitive jokes or memes in this thread, please give this matter the respect it deserves.

He did so much for so many small indie games and made me discover tons of amazing cool stuff, RIP
Damn. His last tweet said he was feeling better but needed more time to recover mentally. Guess it turned for the worst. I learned and laughed a lot through his videos. He will be missed.
I didn‚Äôt expect this to happen so suddenly

I just want to say that his latest update is what got me to go get a scope - I‚Äôm only 2 years older than him 

I got some odd looks when I made the appointments and had it done last Friday 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a little young for this‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah I know but this guy in YouTube is younger than me and got it with minimal symptoms so I just want to get checked‚Äù

They found some small things and removed them and when I woke the doc said ‚Äòif you had waited till you‚Äôre 50 you‚Äôd have a big problem‚Äô

So thanks TB. Even if it doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you now or make your wife feel any better.

edit: I had some minor symptoms and the result was polyps which can be benign or pre-cancerous. Familiy has had polyps too. I don't want to imply people in their 20s with no symptoms should go get their butthole scoped for no reason.
Ugh this is too much, I used to always watch his" WTF is" series üòî
This one hurts.
I respected this man more than most people in the industry. He always fought for the consumer, always tried to right the wrongs he saw in gaming, and never gave up. He was credited by the devs of Warframe, League of Legends, and countless indie games for their success, he helped keep Starcraft 2's competitive scene alive. He got countless people into warhammer.

He was a good man, he was too fucking young for this. Fuck cancer. Fuck it to death. Fuck.
Dosen't feel real
TotalBiscuit made huge strides in the PC gaming community and the Starcraft 2 eSports. Even with his declining health, he was [cracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/3yz9ji/totalbiscuit_on_keemstar/) [roasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/53mll2/totalbiscuit_swoops_in_on_a_whole_new_level_of/) [about](https://twitter.com/totalbiscuit/status/540483889165508608?lang=en) [it](https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/987883457144590336) and still making videos until the very end.

Having him gone is like a huge hole in the criticism space that couldn't be filled by anyone else. He will be missed.

To give you guys perspective on his declining health, here are two audio vids from [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBb2BIVrV7M) to [2018.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT5A13hQSUA)
Well shit. It's crazy how this hits closer to home than other celebs.

RIP good buddy.
Holy hell, I can't believe it.

I've watched TB since the early days of WoW. I got into the game when I was in junior high/high school, when the game was in Classic/BC. I didn't follow many online gaming news outlets. I mainly just got my news and game releases from my brother, who was out of college. Eventually, though, I got sucked into WoW. I also wanted something more from it. I started finding various communities and websites myself, and I eventually found my way to TotalBiscuit and WoW Radio.

Eventually, John left WoW behind, but he was still prominent on other fronts. He was a frontiersman in the young industry of gaming journalism. He never failed to always have a constant stream of content. Did a genuinely good PC game just launch? There was a video about it. Was a game running lower than 60fps? You bet your ass he complained about it. Was a game company acting dishonestly? John was there to breathe down their necks.

The man moved continents in every community he touched. If you're part of any big community built around a game, he likely touched that game, even for a little bit. He did a lot for League of Legends. He damn near built the SC2 community himself in its early days.

I admit I haven't watched him as much as I used to, but if I was interested in a PC game, I always looked to see what he had to say about it. Hell, I even bought a Switch game (Mario + Rabbids) because of him. I'm scrolling down my Steam collection now. Games that he influenced my purchase of:

* Awesomenauts
* Banished
* Bastion
* Battleblock Theater
* The Banner Saga
* Blackguards
* Blood Bowl
* Braid
* Broforce
* Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons
* Castle Crashers
* C'thulhu Saves the World
* FTL: Faster Than Light (my favorite PC game, also lead me to Into the Breach)
* Game Dev Tycoon
* Gunpoint
* Hatoful Boyfriend
* Legend of Grimrock (and Legend of Grimrock 2)
* Magicka (and Magicka 2)
* Octodad
* Orcs Must Die
* Orcs Must Die 2
* Papers, Please
* Pillars of Eternity
* Retro City Rampage
* Reus
* Risk of Rain
* Rogue Legacy
* Sanctum
* Space Run
* SpaceChem
* The Stanley Parable
* Sunless Sea
* Terraria
* This War of Mine
* Transistor
* Transformers: War for Cybertron
* Transformers: Fall of Cybertron
* War for the Overworld
* and, of course, WARHAMMER 40,000: SPACE MARINE

I'd been preparing for the inevitable whenever the news broke at the start of May. I was sad when I saw this tweet, but after going through my Steam list, it hit me hard. I bought 6 shirts to support him after he broke the news. They're getting hella worn over the next couple of weeks. With E3 just around the corner as well, I'm going to really miss his Snarkathon takes on the press conferences.

I'm not a religious person. However, if there is a God, hopefully, TB is giving him an earful right now about FoV sliders in Heaven.

Rest in peace, John Bain.
Feel like crying & I've never even met him. 

Rip üò¢
If you are having weirdness with poop, especially if you see blood, talk to your doctor. Colon cancer is very treatable if caught early. Don't let embarrassment actually kill you.

Completely shocked to hear this. It was only a few days ago [he tweeted he was getting better.](https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/998764067614609408)

This hits hard. I can only imagine how the rest of his family, friends and long term fans are feeling right now. My condolences to all of them.
Rest in peace, John. We all knew that this day would come, but seeing the announcement broke my heart. He was a very important character in the gaming world, hated by some but loved by many. We'll miss you, TotalBiscuit.
We all knew it was coming, but it still hurts so much now that it finally did. I remember thinking "Who would watch 1hr long youtube videos?" And then I found TotalBiscuit and listened to him rant about games for an hour straight. He inspired me to start my own YouTube review channel and I'm sure I'm not the only one. His legacy in the gaming community will live on. RIP TotalBiscuit/
He changed my life.  I don't mean in a game related way, but actual, physical life. 

There was a game that required controlling 2 characters simultaneously via a controller (Brothers? I think) and I about clicked out of his review because there's no way my stupid fucking hands/brain could deal with that.  Then he mentioned he had difficulty because he had dyspraxia. I was curious and looked it up.  I later went through some testing to confirm that yes, that's wtf has been my problem since childhood.  

For as long as i can remember, i was told i was lazy and stupid because i had terrible handwriting or just could not manage shit.  Turns out, i am a textbook dyspraxic. My self esteem has gone up and now I don't hate myself when i trip/smack my shoulder on the door frame/whatever dumb shit. 

Thank you, TB. I'm sorry I put off writing this until now.
Damn, I hoped after his last successful surgery he'd last longer. RIP.

This really terrifies me because I'm about his age and have what I very strongly suspect is round 4 of skin cancer getting looked at Friday. Every time so far it's been basal cell, but this looks different. And I also have a young child. Fuck cancer.
Rest in peace, John. You will be missed. 
Tbh, I was in denial that he'd actually die. I'm still kinda in denial right now. I don't really have much to say, but this feels weird. 
The end of an era.

I know writing a comment on the Internet doesn't mean much, but I want to put my piece out there.

Totalbiscuit has done soo much for this industry, specifically PC gaming. He insisted for years that options matter on a platform that actually needs them, because every gamer is different.

Without him PC gaming would be worse. We are here, because people like him believed in the idea of choice and that people are rational.

He always stood for the rights of the consumer. The average young men and women who need to make informed decisions on the ever growing gaming market.

He put ethics before everything else. His phisophy evolved over the years to be as transparent and concise as possible. Even if his tastes didn't align with ours or vice versa, he always explained his stance, which was valuble. Because both perspectives on a matter yield the utlimate truth.

He made YouTube a better place for video gaming. Back when he started, gaming wasn't the predominant subject of YouTube. But we all saw that change years ago. Gaming in YouTube is hugely important for the industry as a whole and he did his part to ensure that viewers got a fair deal out of it.

His ethics and constant search of the best format to critique gaming has insipired many to do it as well.

And I'm afraid to say there's a huge audience out there right now craving for honest and concise opinion based content. We will never fill the void that's left, but we can learn and grow.

This very much reminds of Rayn Davis' passing in 2013. 4 years and 2 months almost. TotalBiscuit followed GiantBomb and covered his passing in his Content Patch series. The passion with which he explained Davis' passing made me shed a tear about a website and a person I didn't follow or even knew about.

It made me pay attention to GB and eventually become a fan. Which eventually prompted me to start playing a small game called Project Reality where I've found life long friends, all because of a chain reaction caused by TB.

I imagine some people will mourn TBs passing the way I did of Rayn Davis - you still feel the loss even if you didn't really follow TB.

Rayn Davis was one of the most charming and nicest people in the industry. He passed away prematurelly at the age of 34, very similar to TB. Taken away waay too soon. Waay before they could both come to their prime.

Just like GB, it feels like TB was just starting his career. Just starting to break the big news, make a wider impact, but looking back, he already did way more than 99.99% of us will ever do.

I think more of us should strive to be like TB. Start from pretty much nothing and just shoot for the stars. A lot of effort will be required, but if you don't try, you can't succeed.

And to watch him do all of that while battling cancer to the bitter end, staying positive is perhaps something most of couldn't do at all.

His critique, commentary, advice and ethics will be missed.

RIP BiscuitBear

I remember finding out about TB back when I first heard of WowRadio. Always seemed like a good dude. Huge influence in the gaming world.

It's funny. I was up until 1am last night drinking and playing a game. Sometime before I went to bed, I started thinking about how I hadn't seen anything on reddit or twitter the past few days. I thought to myself, "Huh... I wonder if TB is still alive", and I got a really bad feeling. Now I feel even worse.:(
It probably seems silly since I didn't know him personally or anything, but he had a huge impact on my college years. 

I worked three jobs and took a full course load every semester. My one night off a week would be Thursday night, and I'd sit down, order pizza and watch Co-Optional while playing video games. No matter how shitty a week was, I had the podcast to look forward to.

RIP, John.
It‚Äôs scary how fast you can lose someone. Be sure to hug the people you care about today! RIP Totalbiscuit. 
[deleted]
it's odd that the only 'celebrity' deaths that have impacted me have been of games journalists: first ryan davis and now tb.

i suppose it's just a testament to how much impact they've had shaping what i do in my free time and how much i've valued their insights.

see you around, buddy.
I'll miss him so much.
I don't think I can express myself with words here. It's fucking hard. John was my favorite youtuber for years.

Just go and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb50aAFiOpM). I'll be watching it again and again tonight...
Fuck I just got through listening to this week's co-optional where Jesse says "Hopefully TB will be back next week."

He fought so hard against it too, it really breaks my heart for his family. So many give into the inevitable but that dude wanted to spend as much time as he could get with his wife and kid even if it meant indescribable pain.

TB, Jesse, and Dodger kept me a lot of company at work with the length of their podcast. TB's condition reminded me to work a little harder (I'm an oncology researcher).
Fuck cancer.
Rest in Peace, John. I wasn't an avid watcher of his content, but I always appreciated his witty, well\-informed commentary any chance I came across it. 

Also fuck cancer, such an awful disease. Best wishes to his family, I can't imagine what they're going through.
Damn, he'll always have my respect for being the one critic who cared about the consumers more than himself. I lost faith in gaming media long ago, but I admired TB's resolve to not become corrupt and speak his mind against anti-consumer practices.

I was in Dreamhack once and had a chance to chill with him and at every point he seemed like a nice, down-to-earth guy who had good insight about whatever was being talked about. RIP.
Goodbye my friend.  Enjoy the 360 degree FOV up there.
I remember years ago when Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb passed away.  I'd been following him for as long as I could remember, and I learned how today's style of media and direct communication with a fanbase can really make a charismatic personality feel like a part of your life.

I can only imagine what dyed in the wool TB fans are going through.  Heart's out to you, duders.  Let the hours and hours of content stay good and a source of happiness, don't stop watching that stuff.  It was what they dedicated their life to.
I have stated my feelings on what just happened on a different thread, and I feel as it would be disrespectful to repeat them here in the name of karma.

I just want to point out something that just happened that represents the sheer scale of this man's influence upon gaming. An official Warframe stream, headed by the community managers, had to be stopped because the hosts couldn't carry on after hearing these news.

TB has provided a lot of exposure for Warframe, true, but his videos on that game is just but a small fraction compared to his life's work. And yet, his death had such... consequences? I am really not sure what words to use here.
Ugh, rest in peace you Cynical Brit!
John you gave me the inspiration to get me where I needed to be in life. In the rough and lonely times I knew I could count on you to cheer me up. 

Thanks for all the memories. You‚Äôve done all us northerners proud. 
I knew this was coming and it still hurts.
Warning:don't try googling his name to get more info. Google tries to show me YT vids mocking his death and has comments that I'm not even going to summarize.

Just.. Don't. 
RIP. He got me into SC2 and into gaming in general back in 2010. Thank you TB
This sucks. He's a huge reason that I even built up the courage to try doing games critique online in the first place. 

It really hurts to see him go.
Rest in peace, John. Thanks for everything.
Rest in peace John. All of us in the WoW community will never forget you.
When i was 17, my father had cancer and it was the same way.  On his last week, hooked up to machines and unable to speak he had started to get better.  Even with a breathing tube down his throat he was smiling and shaking his head at us... But cancer is a sneaky unforgiving bastard. it hit with the one two punch....again....for what felt like the 100th time that year.  They pulled me into a room to explain what was going to happen in the next 24 hours.  With my mom, grandma and Aunt all there in the room, I said " I wish I had spend more time with him-".  The strongest people in my life lost all composure and... we all cried for what felt like hours. It really was only minutes.  I'm sorry I don't mean to bring out this personal story, but I just wish his family the best and the only way I knew how to cope with this was to know even though he is gone...and you'll miss him. Oh Lord  you'll miss him. hes resting now, his pain and suffering is over and made your lives and many many others better with his time here on Earth.
Utterly devastating news to the gaming community. My heart goes out to his loved ones and his fans.
Oh, fuck off, universe.  
Every time I hear about someone ‚Äòs death, whether I was expecting it or not, whether it was from natural causes or not, I have one primary overriding emotion.

Anger. Sheer untempered fury.

He did not deserve to die. It was unjust, unfair. To have your life stolen from you, ripped away, and to be flung into oblivion. It is WRONG. It should not have happened.

This has nothing to do with me being a fan, though I am. If he never did anything I saw ever again, it would make no difference. If he had never become known to me at all, it would make no difference. As a thinking human being, being alive was his birthright. He was entitled to being alive, and to remaining alive, and nothing could have taken that away.

Because now he‚Äôs gone. All of his memories are gone, as though they never happened. All of his hopes and dreams and loves and desires, completely obliterated in the all-destroying black hole that is death. It is as though he never existed at all.

People say fuck cancer, but that‚Äôs just the cause. Fuck DEATH.

I won‚Äôt say rest in peace because I am not so sentimental about what happened, nor do I honestly believe in it, so it would just be hollow. Instead, I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. You deserved better, and now you‚Äôre gone. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt do anything to help stop it. I‚Äôm sorry things tried didn‚Äôt work.

That said, as hard as it is to accept, you are gone, and what‚Äôs done is done. Let‚Äôs try not to dwell too much on those already lost, but try to learn what we can from the loss. So hopefully eventually we can stop losing so many. There are a lot of others out there that still need saving, or will need it, from this kind of cancer, or another kind, or from something else entirely. All of us.

Those of us still alive have a responsibility to try and save ourselves, and each other. So no one has to have this scourge inflicted on them ever again.
The Terran Republic has lost one of its greatest. He will be remembered.
This is really horrific and a big loss. I feel like TotalBiscuit was one of the few people that really understood games as art and saw what games can become. I really enjoyed listening to his thoughts and critiques and he was invaluable to many gamers, game developers and the gaming community as a whole. If everyone in the world would be as smart, considerate and capable as he was, the world would have alot less problems.

People like him are rare to come by. I truly feel like that whenever we loose someone like TotalBiscuit, its a loss for humanity as a whole.

Though I dont think he would be the type that would want people to be in endless sadness about his death. Instead, we should honor his memory by continuing to consider and spread his way of life and the philosophies he held to make the gaming community and the world as a whole move in a better direction.
I honestly really don't know what to say, I'm sat here watching the latest podcast and then just just see this on reddit.

I must've watched thousands of hours of TB's stuff, this doesn't even feel real, like I've lost someone I knew personally.

My  thoughts go out to Genna and Orion, as well as Jesse, Dodger and everyone else. Just completely shellshocked right now.

RIP
Can't say I was a fan but it always hurt to see someone going. My respects.
He was only 33 years old? I always felt like he'd been around longer than that. Man this sucks. :(
I'm crying right now, and I've never met or spoken to him. I've listened to hours and hours and hours of his podcast, though, and we won't ever get his commentary again.

It's a sad day. :\(
My father was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.  He lived for 4 years.  I can tell you that TB's last years were hell and he was in tremendous unbelievable pain, constantly.  The amount of strength he showed to carry on with the podcast and videos for his family and the audience is truly admirable.  

I played a lot great games over the years that you recommended TB.  I'll miss you.  
I had the privilege of meeting him and Genna at Coxcon 2015. This was just after he'd been cleared that first time, and just before he would be rediagnosed.

I spoke to him on two occasions, one at a signing/photo op, in which I thanked him for creating hilarious, informative, and laying so much groundwork for videogames journalism, and caring about consumer rights. He said he appreciated it, and humbly stated that he was simply trying to say what gamers want sort of eloquently.

The other occasion was as I was late walking to the convention centre on the second day, and I ran into Genna and TB on the way in. I of course didn't want to disturb them, but being a fast walker I was alongside them, so still walking (and they weren't in conversation at this moment) I introduced myself and asked them how they've found the convention so far and if they were looking forward to the panels today. They both said how much they loved this Coxcon experience because having such a small number of attendees made it feels like a bunch of nerds having a big co-optional hangout session. Followed up with a dry remark about how it's surprising Jesse could make something actually good.

Say what you will about TB, he was a lovely man who cared passionately about his friends and family, who was meticulous in his work.
i remember watching the mailbox series , so many memories and now he's gone just like that , damn this sucks , i'll never get used to this 
It's a sad day for gaming today. You may not have always agreed with his views or his opinions on games and gaming, but you cannot deny the impact he's had on our amazing hobby.

I lost my father just over a year ago to cancer. I know how hard going through this can be. I wish his family all the best. It never really gets easier, but I hope they receive an outpouring of support in the days ahead.
Damn, like a punch to the gut, I'll miss you TB.
Jesus. I was never the biggest TotalBiscuit fan (for purely aesthetic reasons, I just didn't personally connect with the presentation style of his videos), but I respected his opinions and always considered him one of the greats as far as industry commentary was concerned. And beyond that, the few times I actually sat down and just listened to the man I was always impressed by his knowledgeability and ethical compass. He was, quite simply, a titan of gaming commentary. Even people like me with only a passing familiarity of his work mourn this passing. Not only are we bereft a rational voice, we've lost another like-minded soul who loved fun and shared his love with the world. And, in the end, we lost a human being. RIP Totalbiscuit.
And here I was hoping for another hilarious E3 Snarkathon this year.. and then suddenly, he's gone. Rest in Peace, snarky top hat man, it's always too soon for the good ones.
Eesh, condolences. My late wife was diagnosed as in remission after years, taken off chemo and then she passed after some cancerous buildup in her blood basically swamped all of her organs in a cascade.

Feelings for his wife, being the survivor is incredibly tough and hopefully she has a good support net. :/
You know when you're trying to think of the right words to say but all you can come up with is "Fuck, man"? 

Fuck, man.

I grew up watching TB. Fucking hell  I started watching him when I was 13 and trying to get into World of Warcraft. I vacuumed up all that Cataclysm footage and you know what? I never even played the game, but I kept watching. 

I'd be lying if I said he didn't influence the person I am today. I got to meet him at CoxCon last year and we bantered a bit about Starcraft II and it was great. They tell you to never meet your heroes but honestly John was solid gold. Solid fucking gold.

Rest in Peace.
R.I.P TotalBiscuit. Feels like you've always been a part of my adult life watching esports and following games. And as a budding game developer i will never forget the man who reviewed the first ever game i released.

You said the best thing about it was that it was free. I put that up as a selling point on the steam page and I will treasure it for the rest of my life.
I will always remember him dancing grumpily with Jesse Cox and Dodger for the Star Wars dancing game.

I will miss him terribly.
We in Europe are right now slowly waking from sleep, only to find that our hearts have been broken during the night. Rest well, TB, we miss you already.
Two years ago my wife and I moved to a new house that required me to commute to work each day. In the interest of my sanity I looked for a podcast to listen to and I found Co-optional.

Every day for the last two years, I have listened to co-optional or other TB/Jesse/Dodger related videos during my drive to work. 

I found in TB someone I could identify with: a fellow father, metal head, and video game afficianado who cared tremendously about his family and friends and interests. Someone who always advocated for the people, and could put a face and voice to so many important issues even outside of the realm of video games. 

I will deeply miss him.
Rest in peace dude. I honestly thought he was going to beat it. I've lost too many family members to cancer it's just a fucking horrible disease. Much sympathy to his family.
This will probably get lost in the masses but it would feel wrong not to offer my condolences and support for anyone passing through.

Like many I am most familiar with TB from his work and contributions to the SC2 scene. He wasn't the most skilled or knowledgeable Starcraft player/caster but he worked his ass off to improve and make the game accessible and entertaining for everyone.

He and Genna are in the absolute upper echelon of people who have helped contribute and mold the SC2 scene into what it is today.

Thanks for everything, rest in peace.
Fuck, I've thought that he had a few more months ate least, a few more podcast, a few more long rants on youtube about some random dumbassery game industry had pulled... Rest in peace, Cynical Brit.
Goddammit, TB. Goddammit... I refused to believe this until the very end, especially when he mentioned how he wanted to keep the podcast going no matter what, and then this... This really is hard to take. I never met the man, but when I was going through difficult periods in my life and was all alone, his content always managed to cheer me up at the end of the day.

Fuck cancer. Fuck this insidious, despicable, deadshit disease. TB, I will remember. All of us will.
RIP
Hard to believe. This man jump-started independent games journalism in the early days of YouTube. RIP
Even though he far outlived the predictions, it still feels way too soon.  Shit.
God damn my heart just sank into my stomach.
[It's a terrible day for rain.](https://i.imgur.com/vPD5S87.gif)
Man this sucks, he was tweeting just yesterday. As a PC games he was my go to guy for reviews. He'll be undoubtedly missed.
What a legend. He'll be truly missed. He stood up when many sat down and just nodded. He'll always be remembered. Best wishes to his family. 
I am truly in tears. This has never happened in my life. I don't know anymore. Rest in peace my sweet prince.
I saw some of his content and liked it but I never really followed him so I can't say I was much of a fan, but it's hard to be a gamer on the internet without at least seeing or hearing about one of his videos, and I think that says a lot about what an impact he had on the scene. He was clearly well liked and touched a lot of people, fan or not it's always tragic when when someone like that passes, especially so young. 

Thoughts are with his family, I don't want to imagine what they must be feeling right now. Wish them all the best. 

Fuck cancer. 
I doubt anyone will see this comment, but TB really made an impact in so many peoples lives and his story is an important one for us all to remember. He will be missed, and so will his personality and storytelling ability. So few are able to bring light and humor to the tragedy of life and he did a phenomenal job of doing so. My thoughts are with his family, but also to the entire community he touched. 

Thanks TotalBiscuit for the memories and the lessons. You won‚Äôt be forgotten. 
It's very strange to have a complete stranger's death give me such a gut pain hearing of his death. 

You'd think it would be like any personally adored celebrity death. But maybe all the years of watching WTF is, and cooptional podcasts is a much more personal experience. You know them better as they share your interests, rather than watching somebody play a character.

Dude did a lot for PC gaming as a voice studios would hear. Did a lot for consumers saving them from bad purchases. He will be missed.
I‚Äôm feeling similar to how I felt when Ryan Davis passed.

He influenced so many people I follow online. His impact is obvious in times like these. His memory will live on through those people and his family.

There are no words.
There is a noticeable void in the world now.

RIP John. You were great.
Way too soon. This is quite emotional for me for many reasons. We're almost the same age and I've been through cancer as well. One much more curable, but still, facing potential death and calculating those survival odds and wondering where your dice gonna fall is quite life changing at this age. Almost over night I went from being an older 'boy' at 32 that thought he was undefeatable in every sense of the world and at the peak of his physical abilities with whole life ahead of him, to turning into a husk of former self, contemplating potential death and what all of that means. Almost a year after chemo I've regained my strength, but that shit forever changed me. Many more years of check-ups and wondering if this symptom of that symptom means it's back. Fuck cancer.

TB was my favourite YouTuber. I've religiously watched every 'WTF is', I trusted his judgment and critique. He didn't sell out, he stuck to his principles, called out bullshit and lies. His seal of approval was an instant purchase for me and he never let me down. He did so much for the community and industry in general. Fucking hell, tearing up just as I'm typing this at work ... A fucking awesome guy, and he's leaving behind a loving family. I'll miss him and I can not imagine how awful they must feel. I'm sorry, nobody deserves this. My sincere condolences.

I'm not the religious type but ... They better have FOV sliders in the afterlife, or they gonna hear it from TB.

RIP
Even though I no longer followed him as closely as I used to a few years back, it still hurts knowing there will never be a new TB video ever again.

While it's tragic that his life got cut short, taking a look at what TB had accomplished in such a short time should be an inspiration to us all ‚Äì he built up a successful ethical business, supported charity and people in need, helped kickstart careers for many of his friends, educated and entertained millions, and left a significant mark on the largest entertainment industry in the world, all through his sheer willpower and strength of character (and an angelic voice). I, for one, barely dare dream of having even a fraction of the positive influence on this world that he did.

Rest in peace, TB. So long, and thanks for all the vids (and everything else).
If you want to support the family, there is a GoFundMe here. It is legit and has been retweeted by Genna Bain. 

https://www.gofundme.com/TotalBiscuit

All proceeds will go to helping TB‚Äôs family financially recover in the absence of TB. 
Rest in Peace John. What you did for the PC gaming community will not be forgotten.
FML not to take away from Totalbiscuit but my friend/brother we grew up together very very closely, passed away today as well from brain cancer, it's a hard fight he has been strong the whole way through. In the end his family and friends were all there with him, I hope the same for Totalbiscuit as well.  I am glad y'all are not in pain anymore but you will be missed dearly from family and friends. Something you both shared and showed me was that no matter how bad of shape you were in you were always kind and helpful to other ppl, you had cancer and still put other ppl first. Great men and the perfect example of being a great human being, rest easy gentleman. Jada Morrow I'll miss you brother.
This man taught me so much about the difference between fact and opinion. It might sound stupid but when I started watching TB in my late teens I genuinely don't think I knew the difference between the two. Nobody ever taught me and it's scary to think how many other people in the world who actually try to push their agendas on others don't know the difference either.
 
He also taught me that not all opinions are made equal. If you're not going to put thought or effort into the opinion you're pushing and have it backed up by facts then it's not going to be worth as much as others that are, and when you bring it to an argument it'll fall apart easily. TB was a master at disagreeing, arguing, and debating his point and it was a joy to watch him pull the sheets off so many game devs who were either trying to hide things from or pull one over on their customers over the years. The boom of PC gaming that happened in the early 2010s wouldn't have been the same without TB holding so many people to account and it's a legacy that we still enjoy today.
 
Late in his channel's lifespan I eventually unsubscribed because I disagreed with how he was running it. I think a lot of his fans ended up feeling the same and tried to judge his character as a person on it when in fact they just had a difference of opinion to him. In the end even if we disagreed with him he was still holding game devs and companies to account for what they put out there, even in his final months. I'm sure he would've done a lot more too if he hadn't been so sick over the last couple of years.
 
Fuck cancer.
His podcast made every Tuesday that much better, the banter and synergy between him, Jesse Cox, and Dodger is one that seemed so natural. 

My deepest condolences to his family, you affected many people in a positive way with your work and won't be forgotten.
As peace befalls you,  
Know tomorrow awaits you,  
For all the love you gave us,  
We carry with us,  
And, TotalBiscuit you will live on.
On a positive note, all of those game developers in heaven are going to have to get their shit in gear when he starts up his reviews
Damn it. RIP.
Rest In Peace, good sir. Fuck cancer a million times over.
RIP, a huge loss for the gaming industry.  
Jesus. RIP man. His videos were fun to watch and his PC analysis videos saved me from wasting money on so many games.
He will be missed. Godspeed TB.
He fought this fate with an inspiring passion.  I admired his passion in everything he did.  What an impressive person.  I didn't really follow a lot of what he did but when I did come across any of it, it was solid.  His influence is undeniable. 

Fuck cancer.
Fucking hell, I binged his wtf videos years back because I loved his no bullshit, straight facts attitude. Gonna binge again tonight. RIP my man, you kept high school me entertained and informed during the boring days at home. 

I feel so sad for his wife. They didn't even get to stream themselves playing games together. Fuck cancer. You never get the time you need with your loved ones. 
Damn.

Rest in Peace, John.

Today we lost an iconic man in the gaming world.

33 is too young,


Man my heart dropped when I read this news. Rest in peace.

RIP. He was a good guy. Farewell my friend!
Amazing how I never even interacted with him, but the loss of him can still affect my day. He will be missed. 
RIP TB
I can't even imagine what his wife is feeling. An absolute loss for the gaming community, but a loss for his family even more so.
Man this one actually hit me. I regularly saw the Co-Optional Podcast for the past 3 or 4 years and he was not only a great host but a great person as well. He was one of the few good ones out there and convinced me to get into games that I would have ignored in the past (got me to really think of games from a specs POV as well and peaked my interest in PC gaming as well). Dude had a good heart and I hope his loved ones the best of wishes. 
RIP, you and your work will be appreciated for years to come.
One of the greats.  I wasn't ever a religious follower of his videos, but you don't need to be in order to know the impact he made on the community.
Magicka with Yogscasts, Terraria with Jesse Cox, Starcraft 2 eSports, and gaming reviews. This guy who I've never met has been part of my life. I'm sad that he's gone now but his impact with the Gaming community hopefully will not be forgotten. 

Rest in peace TB.
I don't have anything all that meaningful to comment here. I simply want to comment that I considered him the model of a entertainment critic since my teenage years. He will be missed. 
I could always count on him to give me a concise and fair review for a game. In a profession where how passionately one can display there hate for a game be equal to how popular they are he was a rare jewel.  Thank you for making the industry shine brighter.
This was one of the game journalist I enjoyed listening to his videos.

His pain is no more. Now he is in peace.

RIP TB.
I remember watching his weekly WOW talk videos back in the day. Was hooked since then and relied on his reviews because I knew he would cut the bullshit and be real with the consumer in a age of BS. I hope his family can take some consolation that he was looked upon by so many.
Cyberpunk 2077 has been removed from the Playstation store, all customers will be offered a full refund.

[Microsoft expanding Cyberpunk 2077 refunds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/kfpchz/xbox_expending_cyberpunk_2077_refunds/)
This launch just keeps getting more insane
This is fucking huge. From full screen advertisements on the front page of the store to being delisted in less than a week
holy shit Ive never seen a game actually get removed
I wasn't expecting this, but I guess CDPR offering refunds in Sony's(and MS) name didn't win them any friends.
[I agree with Chris Davis' thoughts on this.

> As someone who is fed up with being sold broken games, I applaud this move from Sony.

> **However, let's not kid ourselves. This is retaliation for the refund issue. It's not Sony taking a stance against broken games.**
CDPR passed the buck on the refunds to Sony and Sony clapped back hard. What a chaotic week it has been.
So Cyberpunk is technically an exclusive now

Edit: forgot about stadia lol
[Remember when the devs said that the last gen console would be the primary focus](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-next-gen-is-possible-cd-projekt-red-allegedly-says)?

This is probably real bad for Sony to have to do this kind of massive refunding. I wonder if Microsoft will follow suit? They really bungled the hell out of this launch.
[Best tweet](https://twitter.com/KazHiraiCEO/status/1339741387118526465?s=20) from Kaz Hirari parody account is the best burn to CDPR I've ever seen:

> Earlier this month, Cyberpunk 2077 was released on the PlayStation 4. After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store.
One of the biggest clusterfuck releases since... I dunno when... That last Sims City?
Leave it to 2020 to have one of the most hyped games of all time turn into such a shitshow. Where does CD Projekt Red even go from here?
This is actually insane. Has anything like this ever happened to a game this big? I am assuming this means that someone at sony thinks there could be legal problems if they sold the game as a "working product"
I know this word has been used a lot lately but: Unprecedented. A console de-listing a AAA game due to the quality issues, and issuing full refunds out on top of it.
Insane, but the right move. Even as somebody who is enjoying this game ***on PC***, (where it is still riddled with issues), this game absolutely never should have been released in its current state on last-gen consoles. And the way that CDPR handled reviews -- intentionally obfuscating the state of the game, was disgraceful.

CDPR fully deserves every ounce of criticism that they have received since this began. I genuinely feel horrible for the millions of people who bought this game on the PS4/Xbox One. I grew up in a household where we couldn't have every big game that came out; when me or my siblings really wanted something, my mom made it happen, but when we picked a game it had to last a while. All I can think of is that there are probably tons of people out there right now who are struggling during the pandemic who had to pick the game that had to last *them* a while, and what they got was... this. What was already an extremely scummy move by CDPR is made exponentially more scummy by fleecing people when everyone is hurting so much.

100% the right thing to do. What CDPR has done should not be tolerated under any circumstances.
can you imagine telling anyone a few months ago that this whole situation would happen? god damn
I honestly think this is the best course of action. I've been sending around 3-6 reports a day easily from crashes. It would fail any sort of certification in a normal process. Sony give a free pass out of trust. This game is broken. Its more than some bugs and bad performance.

I play it on PS5, so at least I have a smooth experience, framerate wise.
This is all a big fuck up from CDPR but make no mistake, what you are witnessing is a problem that has infected the entire games industry and has done for years. There is a constant push to make games as big and flashy as possible with absolutely no consideration with how viable it is to make them work or the toll it's going to take on the people making them.
I have been gaming for 35 years and I have never seen such a rapid, monumental fall from grace like CDPR have achieved in the past week. It's actually quite impressive just how successfully they have destroyed their reputation. It'd be funny if it didn't mean yet more crunch for the development team. The management needs to go.
Interesting because there has been games *even more* broken than CP2077 at launch on console, probably because of how huge the expectations were and thus the controversy was.

Honestly though? Good. Don‚Äôt let devs release broken games on your platform like this (coming from someone thoroughly enjoying it on my pc). Broken ports are a fucking pain in the ass and I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôve been allowed to just release and patch up later more and more over the past few years. Hope Xbox, Nintendo, steam, epic etc all follow suit.

Edit: man, when I say dev i of course don‚Äôt mean the fucking software developers, I‚Äôm using dev as shorthand for anyone working on the game.
[deleted]
This is fucking crazy. A AAA super hyped title so broken on console it gets removed from PSN. Xbox will probably follow suit. CDPR did this to themselves. I've never seen a swifter fall from grace in gaming than CDPR this past week. But good on Sony for setting a precedent for future companies to not drop unfinished games like this
Wasn't expecting that at all. Good tbh.
Holy shit. On my PS5 it was the main ad I'd see on the store page before it's release. This is massive.
Hooooly shit. That has to be the absolute lowest blow to CDPR‚Äôs reputation you can possibly make. Straight up refusing to sell their game on what‚Äôs ~~probably their largest market~~. I get it, it‚Äôs PC. 

Wonder if Xbox follows suit. God damn. That is devastating. Even the shareholders will be angry about this one.

But it‚Äôs kind of hilarious. I tried refunding a few days ago and a customer service rep told me to wait for the patches that fix the game and that they wouldn‚Äôt be refunding me.

This is unprecedented. Wow. Has this ever happened before? In just one week, CDPR went from being perceived as the wholesome, pro-consumer, can-do-no-wrong studio to being the super memeable "the only AAA game studio to ever put out a game so bad, Sony refused to sell it" guys. The "worse than Anthem and Fallout 76" guys. Yowch. 

I feel sorry for the devs who tried their hardest and just weren't given the time, money or resources to pull it all off. 

EDIT: Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they announced they‚Äôre scrapping the multiplayer altogether to focus on the game‚Äôs state and that they‚Äôre making the DLC free. They‚Äôre gonna have to No Man‚Äôs Sky this shit. Whatever the case, probably gonna be a long-winded non-apology tomorrow.
Damn. Not pre-ordering this was a great decision.
I don‚Äôt know if it was Sony caving to pressure or what pushed them over the edge, but this seems like absolutely the right thing to do. They‚Äôll definitely lose money on this, but it sets a precedent, and I think it‚Äôs the right thing to do for consumers.
Wow, didn't think Sony would do this. Good for the consumers overall. 

Considering the marketing deal with Xbox, I wonder if MSFT will follow suit.
Wow, this is *huge*. What an absolute FUCK UP from CDPR.
When was the last time this happened? No mans sky was issued blanket refunds but remained in store I believe (correct me if wrong)
That's a whopper.
I wish Microsoft would follow suit.

My refund was rejected because I played the game. Ridiculous.
Who else is excited to check out CDPR's stock price when the markets open tomorrow?
This is gaming history right here.

Hard to imagine that this game was being heralded as the GOTY of 2020 before the year even began.

Holy fucking shit.

There‚Äôs been a gaming shitshow every year since 2016:

2016 - No Man‚Äôs Sky 

2017 - Star Wars Battlefront II

2018 - Fallout 76

2019 - Anthem

2020 - Cyberpunk 2077
The right thing to do, not just in terms of offering refunds, but REMOVING the game from the store. 

Biggest way to tell a dev to short their shit out.
How ironic that shareholder pressure pushed CDPR management to rush the game out before 2020 year-end, and now those same shareholders are getting f'd.
It's really sad this game released in the state it did. Im playing this game on PC and absolutely loving it, but it's so clear this game wasnt ready to be released. It'll probably be a year before this game lives down the amount bad press it's been getting (and rightfully so), but I do think once they  fix the performance and bugs, there's a game here that many will love. It's too bad they didn't just give it the time it needed.
Has a game of this size ever been released this broken before? I feel like this is unprecedented
Will this impact updates? The game works pretty well on my PS4 Pro and I want to keep playing, ideally with upcoming patches, fixes, and optimization.
I hope this sends them a message. One, don‚Äôt offer a product you KNEW was defective on over 110 million devices. Two don‚Äôt then try to knowingly pass the buck to a different company.
Holy shit

edit: CDPR's initial (arrogant) statement which subtly-but-clearly threw shade at Sony for not offering refunds surely played a part in this. No Man's Sky had a rocky launch, and Sony distanced themselves from it quickly, but nothing like this. 

CDPR forced what will now be years-long crunch on their devs, manipulated reviewers, actively hid PS4/XB1 footage, lied to all of us - and since that worked out fine for them I guess in their arrogance they decided as a final act to throw Sony & MS under the bus as well

lol
Who didn't see this coming? CDPR told people to go to Sony. What company is going to want to get harassed for something that they had no hand in?
~~The bigger news is that they're removing the game.~~ A pretty big "fuck you" back to CDPR for releasing a total mess and telling people to go to Sony for refunds.
Man, I had full expectations of this game being busted at launch, but this is...unprecedented. Like, has this happened before? Closest I can think of P.T, but that was for different reasons and definitely wasn't at this scale.
Jesus, who could have predicted that CD Projekt Red would end up being one of the most hated companies of 2020 and have their game removed from one of the biggest online storefronts? Edit: The "We leave greed to others" tweet is really ageing badly, I'm sure some of their overworked employees are happy that the company is finally getting some repercussions.
The game needed another year of development at least, and shouldn't have had any crunch time, or at least no mandatory crunch time. Doesn't matter if I enjoyed it, it's dissimilar to what was advertised, poorly optimized at launch, and full of blatantly cut content (life path, braindances, trains, etc).

Ho-lee fuck this is huge. CDRP just did a record pissing away of reputation between this and Devotion.
Damn, regretting buying this physically so much lol. 

Maybe might be time to send this back through Amazon? Wondering if it'll even be possible to do the PS5 upgrade if its getting removed digitally.
So when we getting a fyre festival styled documentary about this?
Damn. For what it‚Äôs worth, I fucking love this game on PC, but I have nothing but sympathy for console players who were also looking for a good time. I knew this game wasn‚Äôt going to be great on last gen consoles, but the fact that it‚Äôs nearly unplayable is mind blowing. What.. happened? Why did they do so bad? CDPR‚Äôs reputation is down the fucking drain, and for what? Saving money?

It‚Äôs so sad to see such a long awaited game be one of the shittiest ever (at least for console players). This was probably the light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel in 2020.. man.
But it's an absolute masterpiece with the most immersive game world to date...


(If CDPR could just release the game code that this reviewer received, I think we'd be ok)

Gods Unchained: "@Blizzard_Ent just banned @blitzchungHS and stripped his Hearthstone winnings because they care about money more than freedom. We will pay for ALL his lost winnings and a ticket to our $500k tournament: no player should be punished for their beliefs. #freegaming"

That's cool, also great marketing, because my first act was to google who the fuck gods unchained are
It might just be another company capitalising on a good PR opportunity, but I'm sure it means a great deal to Blitzchung right now.
The fucking balls of Blizzard to write "we stand by one's right  to express individual thoughts and opinions"

I would be boycotting Blizzard and the NBA, but I am not paying for or watching their shit already.
Well they just got a new player, sign me up. I was literally wondering what game I could replace HS with. Fucking good stuff.
Holy shit, that's the best marketing move I've seen this year

I'm happy that Blitzchung will still get the money he deserved at the end of the day
Activision-Blizzard siding with an opressive regime that harvests organs from religious minorities and political prisioners.

Ok then. I know it means fuck all in the grand scheme of things but I am absolutely not buying any game they make or publish from now on and I advise everyone to do the same.
Yup, fuck blizzard. I was happily enjoying Wow classic but will not support Blizzard if this is their stance. No more subbing for me.
Gods unchained is not a bad game. With a bit of work I think it could definitely eat into Hearthstone's market share. More compelling lore and special events/single player content would be a good step as would rare versions of cool cards with special art or something similar. An open marketplace for trading and custom art submissions would also be cool. The recipe for these card games is pretty simple so iterating on them is relatively easy. Blizzard has rock solid IP but there is definitely something to be done to improve the user experience and expand the TCG aspect.
Question: what can the average person do to stop this? Just stop buying Activision Blizzard games? Because aside from the Humble Monthly, I‚Äôm currently doing that already.
Great move.Have been playing this game for a few weeks in closed beta, solid game with quite the hardcore player base already. definitely worth giving a shot. also #fuckblizzard
Hey everyone, I'm from the Gods Unchained team! Just want to say thank you so much for all the support! We've been overwhelmed by your response.
I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop, what did he say that blizzard didn‚Äôt like?
All pro players should collectively speak up in support of this guy, Blizzard cannot ban everyone. This is disgusting behavior from a company.
It would be sweet to see all the competitors and streamers taking a stance against HK in a form of protest as well. They can theoretically ban everyone but it would be even more of a shit show for their public image.
A) SUPER-SMART MARKETING

B) Shows principals and moral decency. Just don't forget them one day when it's convenient.
Beliefs are subjective. It's not beliefs. It's knowing. He doesn't believe China is shit, he KNOWS China is shit.
[Spam this](https://i.imgur.com/nDXngCo.jpg)

Blizzard is absolutely in the wrong here and even if we can't bring them down, we can hurt them, the plan is to associate Overwatch character Mei as a symbol in supporting HK protests so that China picks it up and maybe even bans Overwatch in China.

That would be a massive hit as majority of Blizzards players are from China. With luck Blizzard might be banned altogether.
Has Blizzard let another professional player express their political beliefs in interviews or as representatives of the game/team before? Are there instances of other professionals expressing their political views and not being banhammered?
To all the people getting hyped for this game - it sounds like Artifact with extra steps. You can't even use real money, you **need** to use Ethereum in order to buy cards, and it's still the same gamble for packs mechanic.

We all know how huge Artifact is due to its P2W system. Do people not learn?

Edit: There's more to it, check the discussion below.
High chance that I am way too late to this thread but a word of warning about this *game*. I followed it closely when it was announced just because I thought it had a strong scam vibe behind it. I still don't believe on the longevity of what the dev is offering. A few point in no particular order that I'd like to share:

- This is a Hearthstone clone. If you want more of the same, that'll be this game. The stats of a lot of cards have their counterpart in HS, specially the classic set.

- The game currently have only one card set as far as I know and it has been this way since the game was announced around 1.5 year ago.

- The price, in Ethereum, of the packs have always been fixed but, as you know, its not the case of ETH.

- You can buy different card packs for the single card set. The most costly packs guarantees legendary cards. The price was always fixed at 0.012ETH, 0.075ETH, 0.112ETH and 1ETH **per pack**. At launch, this was equivalent to around $4.80, $30.00, $44.80 and $400 **per pack**. Today the price point is $2.10, $13.13, $19.60 and $175 per pack.

- The dev claims that once a card is sold, it is unique to the blockchain it was sold to and that card can never chance. As in even if the dev decides to balance the card, the version that was sold will never be affected since it is 'in the blockchain' after it is sold. I know I probably butchered that sentence but allow me to make an analogy. Think of buying a pack of card from Hearthstone with your Credit Card. Think of the process. You buy a pack, a unique transaction ID is generated from your bank. What Gods Unchained dev supposedly do is any cards that comes out of that pack of card now have the unique transaction ID imprinted on it. So, in their server, Transaction ID 1234 has Cards X, Y and Z. That's it. People seems to think that, somehow, the transaction ID is now the card since it is easy to convince gullible people it is the case. So, the general belief is that dev will never be able to change a card because it now belongs to the *blockchain* rather than dev holding back from changing the said card *for now*.

- The dev announced a $1.6m tournament at launch. The prize pool is financed by taking a 10% split from all sales of the card packs. Currently the counter is sitting at around $500k. There's no set date, nothing. You just hope that the number displayed on the website is correct and that the dev will honor their promise one day if it ever hit that amount.

- Card packs were sold before there ever was any game. There was literally nothing and the dev was selling card packs. People were buying. Well more like, people were *investing* since most people back then were riding the cryptocurrency craze.

- Naspers, ~~subsidiary of~~ investor in Tencent, invested $15m in this game recently. If you're sleeping under a rock, Tencent is the largest Chinese conglomerate. This bit actually makes the Tweet even more questionable.

For sure Gods Unchained dev managed to slip just in time for a good exposure by throwing shades at Blizzard but I see people singing the praise of Gods Unchained's dev in here which makes me wonder whether people are even aware what the hell they're even praising in the first place.

Edit: Ugh of course this is sitting at -4 for no apparent reason/post contradicting anything I said. The amount of support in this thread for this game looked suspicious but now doubt removed after seeing how fast this dipped to the bottom.
/u/ImmutablePetrify 

Hello since you're one of the game designers of God's Unchained I hope you can answer this question. I don't mean to be disrespectful, since your game looks cool, but [on September 23](https://medium.com/@immutable/immutable-raises-15-million-for-gods-unchained-b235e1963fba) your company **announced on Medium that you had raised $15M USD ~~from~~ in a financing round led by Naspers, the biggest shareholder in the chinese company Tencent**. Would this be a conflict of interest, because of the political implications of your current announcement? 

Just to make it clear, **I am aware that you did not take money directly from Tencent**. But with Naspers being the biggest shareholder in Tencent, I'd imagine that the assumed support of Hong Kong would be a problem?

---

*To be as transparent as possible: I'm a big supporter of what you've just done here, and I personally stand with Hong Kong.*

---

Edit: *"$15M USD from Naspers"* to *"$15M USD in a financing round led by Naspers"*
Supporting free speech, human rights, and also advertising for their online card game.

Outstanding move!
There's gonna be a huge uptick in players for hs clones aren't there?
Their twitter posts are very interesting. They are making some serious points about economic freedom, free speech and more, as it pertains to game consumers and game companies.
This is fucking disgusting. Why isn't this bigger news?
Reminder that if you no longer plan to support Blizzard make sure to also avoid purchasing any Activision games as well because they are the same company
They took his money away because he broke the contract he signed to participate. 

It sucks what's happening in HK right now but a company who explicitly says, "Don't use our platform for political reasons" is allowed to break their part of the contract when you break yours.
[removed]
Per contractual nonsense, he probably shouldn't have done that.  We all agree that China is committing ridiculous atrocities against HK.  However, I thought we were also all in agreement that you don't sell out your allies, but apparently annoying orange president clickbait did that this week, and people are defending him.  So I can understand Blizzard's desire to stay on the outside of political stuff.

That being said, what really annoys me is their reaction.  The punishment does not fit the crime, at all.  A slap on the wrist, a public statement that the player does not reflect the values of the company, etc, etc, would have been woefully sufficient.  These types of actions are simply petty, egregious, and downright hurtful.  

The lack of tact absolutely convey that Bliz is in the pockets of China.
I am all pro-HK rights and China is violating human rights in lots of ways.

However these titles are misleading - He wasn‚Äôt banished for his **beliefs**.  He was banished for representing them on a corporation‚Äôs private platform. 

Had he stated the same thing by making a video or post and using twitter, for example, none of this would be an issue. 

**More than one thing can be true**

‚Äî I totally agree with his message, **but** Blizzard has no obligation to be forced to be the messenger of his message.
This is one of those weird scenarios where I get what blizzard was doing but it looks really suspect. Their whole rationalization was that politics was brought into their event and that‚Äôs against their rules. Sure I get it.

I think this scenario especially given the massive amount of information coming out of Hong Kong takes this away from politics, and points to human rights and human decency. No decent human being would take another‚Äôs rights away and then complain about ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù when they protest. It shouldn‚Äôt be a political stance to oppose tyranny. And honestly it would‚Äôve been a much clearer stance if blizzard just ignored the quotes or even censored them. If they wanna do that, fuck it let them. But don‚Äôt literally fire them and rescind all of their earnings. 

At this point it‚Äôs probably money driving them and that‚Äôs a shame
Between this and there other crap I am ready to wash my hands of bliz..  Trick is converted most of my wow gold into bliz credit and sub voucehrs at the end of Legion /start of BFA (just left myself enough gold to buy ah mount)  I still have about $500 bucks in bliz credit left.   I think  I may just let it run down and walk away..  no new money coming in  to them
Blizzard was so quick to suggest they did this because this gamer was threatening their reputation, but did they seriously think the blowback from that decision wouldn't be worse? At the very least, I won't give my money to a corporation run by idiots...Blizzard will need a serious change in management before I would ever put money into this ridiculous business.
Simply put, this Hong Kong fiasco was the final nail in the coffin for me to cancel my wow sub. If blizz values money over democracy, they aren't getting any more of mine.
Blizzard seems like a bunch of fucking assholes for this move. Just bowing to an authoritarian regime that silences people with differing opinions. Companies like this should not be able to operate within countries that don't believe in that crap.
I never thought I'd be saying this considering I've bought into every Blizzard title since I was young. 

Fuck Blizzard. Fuck 'em
Did everyone forget about the R6 Siege China situation from a year ago? That should have been the measuring stick
In case anyone is wondering how effective a marketing strategy this is, the answer is...very.

If you have a bliz account you can have it deleted to boycott: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/2659
This also means that the best player (or one of the best players) is excluded from competition.  How valid is the rest of the competition at this point?  Who is to say that Blizzard/China haven't banned more players that we haven't heard of.  How do we know they won't in the future?  How far will Blizzard go to ban players who publicly speak out about the atrocities in China?

not like any blizz games are good, overwatch was fun for a few months, and i don't' care for diablo or crack in the form of a video game.
Fuckin Gods Unchained is A1, fantastic marketing and a smart move all around. I'm tempted to try out their game now, glad I quit hearthstone like 4 years ago.
Back in the day when I got into gaming Blizzard had a legendary reputation and now it seems like it has become a faceless slave of the Chinese government doing everything to get that money on the Chinese gaming market. It's just sad.
[They are trying to roll back their statements, but can't hide this ](https://i.imgur.com/Z9MwP1q.jpg)

They made an announcement here https://twitter.com/Blizzard_Ent/status/1182813270639431681?s=19

They just hope people in the west can't translate Chinese or go in Chinese social media.
I thought they just pulled his interview or whatever (or was that a separate person/incident?) but they actually basically disqualified him for that?

God damn are they morons? Have they heard of the Streisand effect?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
Welp, I'm only one guy that hasn't given blizzard any money anyways since shortly after Overwatch came out but uninstalled battlenet and will never give those douches a single cent ever again and they will not get my 30 minutes of Overwatch playing every 6 months when I'm bored.

Firing the casters and not giving him money he won in a competition is a full on we do not give a single fuck about anything except making money in China which in fairness was already obvious when Activision bought them. That's just an over the top we are China's bitches and will do whatever it takes to keep making money there. It's not hard to hide how greedy and shitty you are, thousands of companies do business in China and can still convince people they don't suck every day but Blizzard did not even attempt to hide it.
Eh, I am not going to applaud them till I see them acting differently in same situation. Easy to jump in for some free PR, let's see what they do when they reach Chinese market.
No gamer should be punished for their beliefs... as long as it‚Äôs our beliefs...

Not supporting China, just pointing out hypocrisy

Belgium says loot boxes are gambling, wants them banned in Europe

I'm Dutch and this is my translation of [the article they used](https://nieuws.vtm.be/vtm-nieuws/binnenland/geens-wil-gokken-games-verbieden) (sorry for the terrible formatting I'm on my phone):

&nbsp;

The minister of Justice wants to ban in-game purchases, if you don't know exactly what it will contain. "Combining gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.

&nbsp;

The commotion started last week with the new game Star Wars: Battlefront in the the game you could buy so called "loot boxes", virtual boxes which could contain advantages for the game. You don't know however what it contains beforehand.

&nbsp;

"The combination of money and addiction is gambling", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.

&nbsp;

Geens now wants to prevent that these kinds of funtions will be in any games going forward. "But that takes time, because we have to go to Europe. We will definitely try to ban it."
It's weird to see our government on the frontpage of reddit, lol. Never thought I'd see our minister of justice of all people talking about lootboxes and gambling in gaming. He did sound like he is serious about it and he will certainly try to take this to a European level.
I'm sure Activision-Blizzard, Valve, Riot and basically every other publisher are very thankful to EA. What an accomplishment!

Let's hope the government actually follows through though. It's a long road.
Oh man Disney are gonna lose their shit with EA after this. Their biggest property is being directly associated with child gambling to the extent that laws might be written around it. I wish I could be fly on the wall at an EA meeting tomorrow. 
Most mobile games are gambling, they literally have themed versions of wheel of fortune, slots, roulette, black jack etc. as daily mini games.
From Gamasutras [article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/310188/Belgian_officials_decide_yes_loot_boxes_are_gambling_and_theyd_like_them_banned.php) on this topic, in the comment section.

Ramin Shokrizade:

> 	I advised the EU in 2013 that these were gambling mechanics, and showed them how they were being deployed by companies like Disney to very young children. At the time the UK was spearheading regulation for the EU. Now that the UK is in flux, it looks like the EU is leaving it up to Belgium to take this on. The EU will ban this content, certain large Western companies will try to find ways around it, and the EU will not mess around. They will sanction. 

>If you are a regular reader here at Gamasutra, then you've known this was coming for years. Major companies (that don't seem to follow the news) have been acquiring labor assets and equipment to optimize their gambling operations and that means they are going to be even slower to adapt to the changing environment. Sure, your virtual world was a lucrative place to drop a casino, but there are children in your games unless you want to make your games adult only, which I don't know of any gaming company that wants to do that. 

>On a personal note, I'm kinda looking forward to playing games again, without having to walk through a casino to get to them.

>The specific game I showed regulators in 2013 at the ICPEN summit was Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, a game made for Disney by Gazillion Entertainment, with overt gambling mechanics (including a roulette wheel) aimed at very young children that may not even be of reading age. As I hinted at last week, I suspect someone tipped Disney off to this ruling in advance and the Disney/Gazillion breakup was damage control, four years late.

>If you look at the link to the VTM article, you will see that European parents are waking up to news reports showing Star Wars Battlefront 2 (with some amazing animation btw) along with the included gambling mechanics and interviews with regulators. This is an amazing amount of free advertising for both Disney and EA, but not the kind they want. This must be catastrophic news for both companies and (as I've been hinting this year) I think you will see that the financial forecasts for both companies were optimistic because they did not anticipate this happening despite it being four years in the making.

>This bewilders me since when I gave my report to the ICPEN in Panama in 2013, the vice president of Disney was sitting three feet from me. I had dinner with her the previous evening. As soon as she was done with her presentation calling for "industry self-regulation" (and we can see clearly what that means) the German chief regulator started asking her why there were gambling mechanics in her products for young children and she fled the conference immediately. The writing was on the wall, I don't understand why they waited for the EU to torpedo their product line and brand image.

>When I got back to the USA after the ICPEN summit, I was asked to present at GDC 2014. I was double approved for a talk on children's monetization, the ICPEN summit, and pending regulation. A panel on monetization ethics that I was on was also double approved. Then at the last moment both were cancelled without explanation. People keep asking me why I don't talk at GDC, and this is why. The gaming industry correction I have been warning of is about to double down, but it didn't have to be this way. Even games without gambling mechanics will be affected as parents, media, and legislators begin to demonize our industry and make alternate purchase decisions.

I love how the Disney lady scurried away from the conference after being asked about giving gambling access, already back 2013. They knew its fucked up.
Assuming this even leads to an EU wide ban on lootboxes, I am going to make a prediction right now. It will only lead to EU specific releases of games.

Basically the game version sold in EU will mostly still have the shit grind that is meant to make you buy loot boxes, and the version for everywhere else has the grind + lootboxes. Publishers definitely don't want to make the non-loot boxed version seem more fun than the p2w version.

If it goes through in the EU I hope more countries follow outside the EU, but if it just goes through in the EU there will still be way too big a market outside the EU to just stop lootboxes completely.

Classic EA. This is without a doubt the most expensive PR failure in the history of technology and games media. 
oooohhhhhh this is getting damned interesting. Now the big question will be are they going to stop the practice altogether? or will EU games just not have it and they continue in the US? And will THAT be enough for American parents/legislators to pay attention? or will it just be dirty liberal EU politics and all hail the capitalist model in the US?

This should be fun in 2 years when the EU finally gets round to it.
More importantly, how do we contact the Minister of Justice there and give him/her our support?
How do they distinguish between a loot box and any mystery crate, collectable card game or lucky dip? They operate on the same principle - you always get something "worth the value you payed", just maybe not what you were hoping for.
Well, there it is. Hopefully this will have at least a small effect to insidious monetization practices. And not just in europe.
I agree. But if you look at how shady Blizzard does stuff in China where Lootboxe Gambling is not allowed. Instead of selling Lootboxes they sell a very low amount of Ingame-Currency and give you Lootboxes as a "Bonus". So you buy like 100 Credits and get 50 Lootboxes as a "Bonus". 

If Lootboxes would be banned, they would find some shady other trick to milk Casualscrubs.
Wait. I can understand them being classified as gambling. Why are they going to be banned in all of Europe? Is there no gambling allowed in Europe?
Could this also mean Magic: The Gathering cards are also now 'loot boxes'?
You can always count on Europe.

But seriously - A ban would probably a bit too much. Gambling isn't banned, so why should loot boxes? Let's see what the EU has to say, but this is a great step. Age restrictions are a must, and maybe European-style warning signs everywhere on the product to let gamers and parents know about the games nature. 

The fight of the future will be about trying to hide the money-grabbing nature of the game. Games today don't even try to hide it. But it will surely become better for consumers.
Very interesting. This is technically ruining every single TCG.

I'm looking forward to seeing the implementation in real life and if it will fix the problem or be the case of "be careful what you wish for".
This title is misleading.  The article says the purchase of loot boxes **for money** is illegal, not loot boxes.  The concept of loot boxes has been around long before in-game purchasing ever became a thing.  
[removed]
I have some issues with the EU. This is not one of them, I appreciate their willingness to smack corporations upside the head.
FINALLY.

I have no problem with a game selling me extra stuff, but JUST SELL ME THE FUCKING STUFF

Don't put it behind an rng wall with 50 other things.

just sell the thing


I've hated these random loot boxes for money from day 1, they're garbage and their sole purpose us to suck as much money as possibile out of people and really jamb it in the ass of people who don't know any better (kids, hapless idiots)

Good riddance 
[removed]
This is part of why I love living in Europe. Governments have the resources and focus to take public matters seriously in a swift manner.
I stand with Belgium in this.

The monetization of every fucking little thing in games looking to exploit kids and the addictive nature of gaming is absolutely disgusting.
The nice thing about this is that it's probably immaterial whether or not this happens, that it could change the insidious monetising culture we're now seeing in more games that aren't F2P regardless.  The European Union comprises (currently) 28 countries, of which there are some comparatively wealthy countries where game spend is considerable, and so this news adds 'risk' to loot-box heavy games.  The biggest publishers will not want to invest in big-budget AAA titles if they might end up being banned from sale to the EU at a future date.
I honestly did not see things going this way! I guess this goes to show just how powerful some less than stellar PR can be!
My coworker got her kid a playstation for his birthday last year. For the next few months every time I saw him he was begging to get a playstation gift card so he could use it to buy currency for his online games. See my coworker was smart and didn't give her credit card for his account, but instead he just begged for gift cards to load onto his account instead. She did put her foot down on his purchasing habits but it was clear her kid had developed some problems buying items for his online games. So seeing stuff like this makes me happy, I'm glad that gaming companies and their predatory practices towards microtransactions are getting the scrutiny from governments that they deserve. 
Loot boxes are gambling and in-game transactions need a guaranteed value in order to avoid that classification? Okay, you can now buy in game currency which is used solely to buy loot boxes.

- Every AAA publisher
This is a great first step. I know some people think cosmetic loot boxes are okay. But why wouldn't you want it to just go back to when you bought a complete game, period?
While I'm glad that lootboxes are finally getting some real pushback, getting the legislators involved may backfire spectacularly.
Good.  
On a purely scientific level I am now curious how they will try to steal money from addicted children, once this is banned. They'll have to get real creative now.
They have a point, but I don't mind having some cosmetic content in a game.  
But it should be treated as gambling. Having a serious age restriction and warning in the game.  
How would this affect Rocket League with its cosmetic only loot boxes?
I am sorry for being skeptical, but is this *really* going to be a be a good thing? I hope I don't come off as a contrarian or anything like that, but I don't see government intervention on gaming as a good thing.

I wouldn't mind my views challenged however.
I really hope this has a knockon effect with other countries. It's gotten far too out of hand now and it's only going to get worse as it progresses.
I like the wording of it, to ban PURCHASE of things like loot boxes I think is fine... Can keep them in general as a practice, but can be free like leveling up in Overwatch. Traditional stores selling cosmetics should be a fine replacement for such systems anyways I feel.

However, such wording can also be exploited. Example given how Blizzard in China is selling Hearthstone card packs by selling dust that happen to come with free card packs. They could very easily get around this in Overwatch by simply selling a very small amount of in-game currency that happens to come with a free loot box.
They just need to make items purchasable directly. This way you can use cash to buy what you want and still keep lootboxes for f2p purposes.
I'm really surprised we're the first ones to do this, usually we're late at the party for these sort of things.
I doubt it'll get banned but this is a very strong message to be sending to companies like EA that they've taken things too far. If games with loot boxes were increased to an 18 age rating, with regulations and increased taxes it would probably be enough for the publishers not to see it as being worth doing and back off.
Welp. On one side: Full price Games with lootboxes: GREAT

For "Free games" like for me: Gwent/Hearthstone: I'm not THAT happy, because I don't know what that will mean. If they ban "GAMBLING" that means that these "crates" in f2p games would be gone,too.
That's a fuck ton of mobile games that are gonna be removed from their respective stores if that follows through.
While important, all this publicity about *gambling* is unfairly distracting from other forward-thinking gameplay elements EA is pioneering.

In a recent announcement, EA says it will now award in-game currency, at the rate of one crystal per cigarette smoked, or two crystals per hard liquor shot.

But these rules don't apply to those under 12 - for young players, a special outreach program is available where they are awarded double the crystals.
I'm generally in favor of banning loot boxes but I just had an interesting thought.  How are loot boxes different from other random chance things such as baseball card packs, blind bags, or even coin operater vending/toy machines at the supermarket?
I have really mixed feelings about this. I'm not particularly a fan of loot boxes, but I think folks just opened a can of worms by asking a government to regulate the content of video games. The solution to the loot box problem was already happening in the form of bad pr and people voting with their wallets. If the eu actually follows through with this, I think it sets a pretty bad precedent.
Before people start celebrating, EU doesn't make laws overnight, so let see and wait if anything comes out of it

Nonetheless, i would live to be a fly on the wall of certain gaming companies' meetings about this from EA to Activision
The new Call of Duty is the absolute worst with Loot Box content! Ooo Rare Supply Drop 3 items! Item 1 common calling card Item 2 common pistol grip Item 3 RARE PISTOL GRIP! Its so fucking frustrating, no one gives a fuck about yo pistol grip. Disgusting filler!
Welcoming the Talented Teams and Beloved Game Franchises of Bethesda to Xbox

$7.5 Billion.  Twice as much as Minecraft.  https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1308028640488292352?s=19
Microsoft: I guess I can't buy Tiktok anymore, whatever shall I do with this money?
[deleted]
Sony: *locks down 2 Bethesda next gen games as PS5 exclusives*.
Microsoft: Alright, I'm buying the whole damn company.
mate did Microsoft just straight up bought Bethesda? 

what the fuck
[removed]
Holy shit! This is especially weird considering that Deathloop and Ghostwire are timed PS5 exclusives. What on earth is even happening with video games currently?
Microsoft just bought Zenimax. This is huge. The parent company comprises of:  

**Bethesda**: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield.  

**Machine Games**: Wolfenstein.  

**Tango Gameworks**: The Evil Within, Tokyo Ghostwire.  

**ID Software**: Doom, Quake, Rage.  

**Arkane Studios**: Prey, Deathloop, Dishonored. 

**Zenimax Online Studios**: Elder Scrolls Online  

This also includes **Alpha Dog Studios**, a smaller mobile-focused game studio and **Roundhouse Studios** which is a newly founded studio comprised of former developers of Human Head Studios (Prey (2006), Rune).  

Zenimax owns some of the biggest 3rd party gaming IPs, and has produced some of the best selling and most acclaimed games of the previous two console generations. This will certainly shake up the industry, and I could see other major players (Sony, Tencent, Google, Activision Blizzard, EA) responding with acquisitions of their own.
How on earth did they keep this a secret?
This is an absolute *blindside* in every sense of the word. I would have never imagined Zenimax would want to play ball in such a capacity, and I can't believe that Obsidian could theoretically take another crack at Fallout.

Microsoft went from creatively bankrupt to "buying machine" in two years. I just don't know how i feel about them buying something that's so monolithic rather than the usual small-time outfits. Minecraft is so ubiquitous that it made perfect sense to keep it how it was and releasing on every platform, but the same can't be said for stuff like RAGE.
I wonder if this means all future Bethesda games will be exclusive to Xbox/PC? I know Xbox has been pushing this "play the way you want" stuff with crossplay and XCloud.
[removed]
this is an absolute megaton. 

not particularly happy on behalf of playstation players, but this is easily the biggest acqusition since like... forever, pretty much
[deleted]
So Gamepass just become something else, don't forget they're adding EA Play as well this holiday. Easily the best deal in entertainment now.
Well, that's one response to the "MS doesn't have any big first party studios" point.

I always saw Bethesda/Zenimax as one of those companies that's a major AAA publisher in their own right, never in a million years would I have expected them to be the ones getting acquired.
Tomorrow:

Sony buys Activision Blizzard.

Next day:

Microsoft buys Cd Projekt Red

The day after:

Nintendo buys Nutaku
Jesus, that is huge! Wonder if this will be a Mojang situation and they'll continue to publish games on other consoles.
[removed]
I'm not sure how I feel about such a relatively large publisher getting acquired. Up to this point both Sony and Microsoft were buying up independent studios which weren't that big and could benefit from the financial stability of being under a larger umbrella, but now we have the precedence of larger game publishers merging which could lead to less diversity in the industry and also make it even harder for the small fries to compete.
Obsidian Fallout pls?
Damn, that‚Äôs a pretty big move. The consolidation wars continue, for better and worse. 

Phil you better be in a meeting with someone right now about starting up a new Dishonored.
Well this certainly came out of left field. I didn't realize Bethesda was looking to be bought out, they've had a string of hits lately.
This might be the most high profile buyout of game studios I've ever seen. Imagine a world where:

* The Elder Scrolls: VI
* Dishonored 3
* Fallout 5
* DOOM
* Prey 2
* Startfield

Could become Xbox exclusives, that would completely evaporate the "Xbox has no exclusives" sentiment. Awsome to see Microsoft is actually swinging its weight around.

Edit: From Xbox UK's twitter account.

> [Yes this means we will be adding Bethesda‚Äôs iconic franchises to Xbox Game Pass for console and PC.](https://twitter.com/xboxuk/status/1308056874567241728)
Wait a fucking minute, you're telling me Microsoft now owns Fallout, Bethesda *and* Obsidian?
Any chance all current and new Bethesda games will be coming to gamepass?
They probably have made a lot of people who wern't sure about pre ordering tomorrow change their mind. A damn smart bit of timing
Holy moly, this is huge!

Those are some of *the* biggest IPs in gaming! It never ecen occurred to me that Zenimax/Bethesda might be bought up considering how much they've been pushing their own launcher and stuff, let alone by Microsoft. Absolutely huge news, the kind that Microsoft needs.
[removed]
Wait, So like, if Xbox now owns bethesda as Well as obsidian, it might be possible, that next fallout could be made by obsidian, or at least in assosiacion with them?
Bethesda and Obsidian sitting in a tree... M A K I N G ...  

Fallout New Vegas 2.   

Or, just give the whole Fallout-franchise back to Obsidian for that matter.
Holy hell! This is an unbelievable big purchase for Microsoft. And it's going to be killer for Game Pass.

MS seems to be shifting their whole business model away from one-time purchases of consoles, to monthly sub income from services. It also means that you have to play on a Microsoft software and hardware platform, be it Window (money to MS) or Xbox (more money to MS).

With Bethesda and Zenimax in the stable, that's just more value for Game Pass. That's going to be massive for them in the long run.
Holy shit. 

‚ÄúXbox has no games!‚Äù

Xbox: ‚Äúhow about exclusive Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored, etc‚Äù

What a wild story to wake up to. This is a game changer. Exclusive Oblivion is one of the reasons I originally bought a 360. Unreal
I gotta admit, 6 months ago I would've never even considered the new Xbox over PS5. But with Hellblade 2, bringing the financing plan to Canada, and now this I'm *seriously* considering it.
So does this mean we dont have to use the bethesda launcher now?
Does this mean Obsidian can work with the Fallout franchise?
Holy shit! Wow! Yeah, by the time the next gen after this rolls around, Xbox is going to own half of the video game industry lol. I know they were looking to acquire more studios, but an entire publisher as big as Zenimax? Wow.

Edit: OK I had to click the link three time just to make sure this isn't a joke. What is happening?

Edit: OK ok, I'm just coming around from initial disbelief now. So Xbox has 8 more studios now, 6 of which are quite big developers. That takes their studio count all the way up to 22 studios. PlayStation, meanwhile, has like 12-13. Massive difference.

It makes sense from a Gamepass perspective though. If Microsoft wants to have a huge title on Gamepass every 3-6 months then they need a lot of studios. Still, madness.

Also, we haven't even got to the IPs yet. Xbox now has Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Wolfenstein, Quake, Dishonored, Prey and so many more IPs as exclusives. Sheer fucking madness I tell you.

Edit 2: OK as my emotions are going back to normal I'm also realising some of the consequences. Previous acquisitions by Microsoft were only really closing the gap to Playstation and the latter didn't really have much to be worried about as it still had bigger studios with a higher pedigree. This though, this changes that. In terms of studios and content, Xbox has just opened a huge gap to PlayStation. The content won't immediately be seen but I assure you, a year or two from now we're gonna be drowning in XGS games.

Playstation obviously cannot and won't take this lying down. Yup they have less money to spend than Microsoft and all that but if they want to remain competitive they're going to have to. Microsoft just started a big arms race. I wonder how many independent, non-indie studios are even going to be left by the end of this thing. Zero? Most probably zero.
This is a big move, but I don't think it's a good move for the industry.

I think there needs to be a bigger conversation of the impact this acquisition will have on the health of the games industry.
Wait, that means Obsidian and Bethesda are now under the same roof. Slight hopes for another Obsidian Fallout?
So this explains why Skyrim HD Collectors Edition 4K Remaster Legacy Mode Upgrade wasnt announced as a PS5 launch title
What the fuck, as much as I am an xbox fan boy, hard to see how this helps the gaming industry as a consumer.
I wonder if Microsoft is gonna use ID tech more often to avoid paying Unreal royalties or start licensing out the engine. Quake vs Unreal, it's like we're back to 1999 lol
I don't see Bethesda major releases being exclusive, even with this deal. There is just too much money to be made with including all consoles.
I'd assume this means previously announced games like Ghostwire Tokyo will still come to PlayStation, yeah? Deathloop is obviously still happening, but I wonder about Elder Scrolls 6 and unannounced (but likely in the works) games like Wolfenstein 3 and Dishonored 3.
I would've never thought Zenimax would be willing to sale. What a good move on microsoft. The IP rights alone make this an unbelievable steal.

Bungie Splits With Activision

You gotta wonder why bungie wanted to get away from halo and Microsoft to take on a "brave new world" only to sign up with activison and make another sci-fi shooter 
>Bungie also has¬†a brand new game¬†in development thanks to a $100 million investment from NetEase.

NetEase? Get ready for DESTINY... IMMORTAL.
Coming to mobile. 
[removed]
I'd say to treat this as good news, but also be skeptical.

Just because Activision is hated doesn't mean Bungie wasn't responsible for some of the bad decisions.

Wait to see the change before you buy into whatever they do next.
[Bungie on the matter.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47569)

This is big news. Congrats Bungie.
Huge move by Bungie, hopefully they can make a great comeback in the future and establish their dominance like they did with Halo.
Holy shit, this seems like a huge move. Will Bungie self publish new Destiny stuff, or go to another publisher?
Woooow, that's insane. I can't believe this actually happened. Really curious to see what this means for the future of Bungie, but I feel this is gonna be a positive for the future of the company.

Personal, I feel like Activision was forcing some very poor decisions onto Bungie that hurt their reputation in order to get more short-term profit.

EDIT: Quick question, the hell is going on over at Activision? Lot of huge changes happening in the last week or so.
~~Is Destiny 2 going to get *thbt* right off the battle.net launcher?~~

I really wish Blizzard did that, but unfortunately i know deep inside that it's already way too late for that.
That's an interesting development. Did Forsaken sell so bad for Activision they went along with this?

If they don't have Destiny 2, Activision is now pretty much left with Call of Duty. And Sekiro next year I guess.
If they're moving forward with Destiny then this could be a great move for the franchise. 2 of the core issues with the game are the Seasonal nature of the game and the need for numbered sequels. Both have knock on effects that have served to make more money at the expense of the game experience.

As a regular player of the franchise, this may not bear fruit for a couple of years, but I can only see this being a big, positive move for the game going forward.
This is genuinely massive. But I feel like this might show something major about the state of Bungie in due time: how much of the BS that was in Destiny was Bungie's doing, or Activision's meddling? 

I'm optimistic for the state of Bungie, but we don't know where - and how far -the rot of greed has set upon the studio, if at all. I'd keep this in mind going forward, if future Destiny content (depending upon the terms of split) retains the same money grubbiness compared to before, or if it's a new lease on life. 
Destiny failed from within though. They've lost some very creative individuals that were the face of the company throughout the halo years because of this era. It seems like as time has gone on Bungie has succumbed to inside problems more than outside pressure from its publisher. Activison demanding a consistant creation cycle may have only exasperated those underlying issues within Bungie. Not that I have any inside information, just my impression from following the arc of the destiny franchise over the decade. 

I personally wont be investing anything in Bungie until their next game releases. I cant afford to assume that splitting from Activison will equate to success for them. 
Jason was tweeting that there was bad blood between Bungie and Activision before the first Destiny even shipped. He said the current Bungie team is so happy with their decision and they were cheering loudly when it was announced at the meeting today. And I'm happy for them. 

Really goes to show you how Activision can poison everything with their management, interference, and expectations. Their marketing and finance teams full of people with MBAs and no passion for games get their tentacles on a project and shape how it develops. Instead of passionate game designers making the games they want, the MBAs design a monetization scheme that the entire game has to revolve around. The result is a shallow slot machine/loot box generator that lacks depth and solid game mechanics. I'm really looking forward to seeing where Bungie can take Destiny now that they own it completely. 

This really sheds a little more light on the black hole that Blizzard seems to be sinking into as well. 
‚ÄûEmployees cheered and popped champagne, according to one person who was there.‚Äú

LMAO. That part really cracked me up. 

I really respect Bungee for this decision. I think it was the right thing to do. 
[removed]
Hopefully this is the start of Bungie turning back into the phenomenal studio that made the original Halo trilogy. 
I remember seeing all of the "NOOOOOOOO!" comments when Activision was announcing a partnership with Bungie because of the former company's strategy to milk a series (ex. Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, Skylanders) for profit.

With the way Destiny is designed, it cannot have annual sequels while the classic DLC expansion model seems to put a sour taste in Activision's mouth.

I'm curious to see where this split will lead into. Will there be a Destiny 3? If so, which company is going to be totally cool with Bungie handling its own business decisions?
Redditors shitting on Activision throughout this thread - but the reason Destiny was even a modest success was because of the shitload of money Activision pumped into it to make it one.

Activision gave the original game a 9 figure advertising budget. I was in Europe when it launched, and adverts were playing everywhere, posters in every single railway station. Despite the game being an absolute mediocrity, the amount of marketing made it too big to fail. It generated stories day after day on every website regardless of the games merit. That the highlight of the game was shooting things spawning out of a cave shows how bereft of content it was, relying on cynical skinner box tricks rather than genuine engagement.

Maybe Destiny is good now. But Activision definitely deserve credit for making the game happen.
It was always so weird to me how Bungie had always talked about how badly they wanted to be independent during their Halo years, always talking about their plan to become their own company and not have a parent company ruling over them. 

Then as soon as they left microsoft they ran straight into activisions arms. 

I feel people have forgotten that Bungie was the one who rebooted *both* Destiny 1 and 2 a year before their launch date due to general mismanagement.

Splitting might give them more headroom in terms of deadlines, but I'm still incredibly skeptical when a company somehow manages to pull off the same mistake twice.
I would be interested in seeing the terms of this separation and who had to pay what penalties.

Curious to see now if that deal with NetEase is what's next and where their franchise goes from here! 
A lot of people don't realise how much Microsoft's writers and production people saved Halo. Halo was basically written by Microsoft writers bought onto the project to salvage it under incredibly harsh conditions. Halo 2 and Halo 3 only turned out as solid games through intervention from MS's people and horrifying amounts of late development crunch.

Bungie are one of those companies that got away with terrible development practices during that delicate period when a small-ish team could churn out a AAA game in under a year crunching like crazy. As production values got higher and higher, Bungie began to fall apart. Destiny's development was a complete shitshow where the entire game was scrapped and rebuilt six months from release. That is not something well run companies do. That is the domain of companies with no freaking idea what they're doing. Who needs project management when you can just crunch your teams into oblivion doing 3 year's worth of work in six months because you spend most of development pissing it up the wall?
I have my hopes but everyone should keep in mind that Activision was a downright saint to Bungie during the development of Destiny 1. They knew not to mess with the golden goose too much, but Bungie kept fucking up on their own. 

Keep your expectations tempered.
This can only help the franchise. A lot of Activision's profit-driven decisions visibly harmed the quality of the product Bungie was able to put out and maintain. Hopefully being under Bungie's control allows Destiny to slowly shift into the original vision they had for the series.

Edit: Iterated releases of the franchise were baked into the deal between the two companies. Could this allow Bungie to shift away from the Destiny, Destiny 2, Destiny 3, etc. model and make a single, living Destiny with continuous content updates more along the lines of a true MMO?
>Bungie also has¬†a brand new game¬†in development thanks to a $100 million investment from NetEase.

I really am excited to see what they can do now, except for this bit... 

Can anybody else smell a mobile game coming? Ugh.
Do people really think a company that could pull away from a major publisher didn't have a majority portion of control over how their game was made? Maybe Bungie will come out with something great but I'm expecting the usual destiny cycle where it's dissapointing and then slowly gets better
Can they hire Marty O'Donnell back now? Still heartbroken over how that went down.

Hope this means that Bungie can start becoming more of their old selves again.
I really wonder why the hell so many people on internet thinks that Bungie is owned by Activision. 

Btw, Bungie will probably use the money of NetEase for that

https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422410/bungie-netease-100-million-investment-china-destiny-business

And no people, Bungie had all major decisions on Destiny, it wasn't Activision. The only things that you can blame Activision are MTX and constant releases. Otherwise? Bungie had complete control of the franchise and you'll see it in the future.
[removed]
I can't imagine this will have a positive effect on the company. After the mass exodus of talent following Destiny's troubled development, a lack of a major AAA publisher funding them may hurt them immensely in terms of what they can accomplish.

At the very least, it sounds like the actual people at Bungie are happy with the decision so I wish them the best of luck. I will ALWAYS root for Bungie.
Not sure why people are so exciting about this.  They have Destiny which is a DLC machine and now a mobile game by NetEase.
So I guess this gets them out of making a destiny 3?
Was   there some kind of  contract limitations that had been reached? I cant imagine  Acti did this out of the kindness of their heart, and I dont see any mention of money exchanged.

&#x200B;

If their contract date had hit its conclusion, this couldnt have been a surprise to anyone and  yet no one mentioned this until now.

Can anyone ELI5 how this went down and why Activision let them go?
Fuck me this might be the best news I've heard all day. Hopefully other studios that can stand on their own two legs wind up leaving the publishers that milk them dry and discard them once the creativity has been exhausted.
I guarantee there will still be micro transactions in the next Destiny. I‚Äôll never believe the B.S. that it was only Activision who wanted it in there.
Found an interesting [talk by Chris Butcher](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022106/Lessons-from-the-Core-Engine), an Engineering Director at Bungie during development of the "Tiger Engine", an evolution on Halo's "blam!" engine, which started back in 2008 before *Halo: Reach* even came out, and ended in 2012, giving them just under 2 years to develop and release the first Destiny, instead of the 4 years they'd planned for.

Apparently things just didn't pan out quite the way they intended with the engine as a whole (this guy figures they achieved about 60% of what they set out to do) due to certain core aspects having poor foundations, and as a result every time they wanted to develop something, it was a slow and arduous process. Importing content was slow, and didn't scale. Rebuilds sometimes took tens of minutes to complete. Some features were poorly implemented or half-assed due to developers not wanting to wait for dependencies, which led to low performance of those features.

Basically, Bungie didn't get a proper plan in place for how to structure their development and allocate their resources quickly enough, and paid the price with a slightly dodgy engine that from a consumer point of view performs very well, but from a developer point of view is an absolute nightmare to work with.

Their overall development time for the engine was far slower than intended, and that combined with the low-performance of certain development tools had a knock-on effect that impacted the rest of Destiny *and* Destiny 2's development. It also meant that creating new content was a painfully slow process, because it would mean importing new assets (low-performance feature that never scaled properly) and testing new builds (which take an age to complete). This is what they mean by "It was too hard to create new content and we just couldn't do it anymore".

All this meant they ran out of money because everything went over schedule, so in order to reach Activision's lofty revenue goals and release schedule, they renegotiated to put out smaller content packages and added microtransactions to generate an additional revenue stream. Apparently, even that wasn't enough, because Activision still said that all of Destiny's sales, even Forsaken, which was their best-selling expansion and almost sold as well as the base game, weren't good enough.

&#x200B;

To summarise, if Bungie had properly planned out their engine development, there wouldn't be microtransactions in Destiny and the games would have had significantly more content, because the engine would have been more feature-rich, far easier to work with and have drastically reduced development times.

&#x200B;

So, is Bungie at fault? Yes. Is Activision at fault? To a lesser extent, also yes. But not out of some kind of evil intent. It was simply because going into this whole arrangement nobody had any idea everything would go quite so wrong. Hopefully, if they are working on some kind of mobile game with the money from NetEase, it'll give them the time they need to sort out their engine, and by the time we get their next game, be it Destiny 3 or a new IP, they'll be in a much better position to put out some good quality games.

I wouldn't hold out much hope of Destiny 2 changing anytime soon though. That's still running on a crappy engine nobody at Bungie wants to work with right now.
Everyone celebrating. 

I'm not convinced this is good news. 

Devs studios and the habits they inhibit change, we shouldn't just suddenly trust because of their developmental past. 

If Activision wanted their ass out the door and didn't even want the IP that kinda stems something else is going on internally. 

To me, it seems like Activision lost all trust in not only Bungie but the Destiny IP all together. They see no future in it, why else would they cut them loose? 

Believe it or not, these things don't happen for the benefit of the consumer. Bungie did **not** "fight" for this. So at the end of the day it begs the question, why they hell did they do it?

Bungie must have more internal problems than we can guess. Or something is happening to Activision's structure. 

Maybe they're *that* confident in straddling Blizzard IP's into mobile for the next few years.
A lot of people are celebrating, but not reading between the lines.  This is likely only possible because of a 100$ million investment from Chinese company Netease.  You know, the same company that is making Diablo Immortal, the same company that has a HORRIBLE reputation in China.  Here is what a Chinese game had to say about Netease when Diablo Immortal was announced:

>

>"In China, we call net ease as 'pig farm' which mean, they do not treat player as normal human but pigs. If EA is like a 2 out of 10, Netease is -2859"

>"The funny thing is, in NA, players hate the mobile game.But in China, we are ok with mobile game, but we are not OK with Netease mobile game. Thats how bad it is."

Halo Master Chief Collection coming to PC (Steam)

Steam page is also up

https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/
Man, all these years of "Pleading the Fifth," Eldewrito, SteamDB listings, its been fucking crazy.

Steam workshop for forge stuff is a match made in heaven.
Ultrawide support already confirmed is making me feel good, and they are adding Reach to the collection. 

Episodic is fine with me, and starting with Reach is a big surprise. 
Hoping it will be a Play Anywhere title as well (even if we're limited to the MS Store for it). Bought it on Xbone. Would be nice if I didn't have to double dip.
I expected the PC announcement.

Did NOT expect it to come to Steam. Bravo Microsoft for not keeping it a MS store exclusive. 

EDIT: A little disappointed it won't release all at once. They're going to release one game at a time to ensure that it's working as intended. 
steam? well well
Halo on Steam.

There are those who said this day would never come.

‚Äã
What are they to say now?

[removed]
As someone who doesn't and hasn't had an Xbox in a while, I can't wait to finally play through the series again!
Is there a release date? This seems like the most important information left out, unless I completely missed it. 
The youtube announcement

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88VBun17AMI
Hot damn.

I'm Happy for my PC playing friends out there. They finally get to join in on the halo fun. Bonus for coming to steam to as well.

EDIT: Reach confirmed coming to MCC as well. GG 343i.
Absolutely amazing. This is the best news of the year so far.

Massive kudos to Microsoft for not making it gamepass or windows store exclusive 
My only concern is that I'm no longer 16. I can't stay up til 3 am drinking yoohoo in my friend's basement trying to grind our 50s in the mlg playlist.
Any word if it will be cross platform with xbox? I'd love to play through it coop with my buddy who doesn't have an xbox
Halo MCC on steam was a definite shocker

Edit: Holy shit, Reach is being added to it
Steam and Windows store. With a rollout of the campaigns slowly. Plus mother fucking Reach. This is awesome.
This is dope but it is also making me wonder, will Halo 5 come to pc fully too by the end of this? Halo 5 is the only one I never got to play because I didn't get an Xbox One so that would be great. 
Holy shit, this is the most hyped ive been in a long time.

The amount of hours we put into this during secondary school was insane and will always be my best multiplayer experience.  
Cant wait to play the campaign missions again and hope the multiplayer will be alive.
Besides this being great overall news (provided the conversions to PC go OK), this aligns with something MS has been lining up for a couple of years now (and yet some folks don't want it to happen) - Microsoft is shifting their strategy away from competing on hardware, and instead competing on service.  

While the current generation, and next generation may still have a hardware component to them, they are becoming less and less relevant.  Why try to corner the market with thin margin hardware (that plays nearly all the same games as your competitor) when you can try to capture the market by software/service (Windows).  Xbox hardware is just a Windows 10 PC anyway.  There isn't a compelling reason to avoid a PC release if hardware isn't main factor in your business model.  Microsoft is trying to make gaming seamless and "easy" within any Windows device.  The thought is that it will be so easy that people will find themselves just using it, because they have it (less reason to go buy your competitor's hardware).  Throw gamepass in there and now the entire service is complete.

I'm not saying this is the PERFECT way to game.  I'm just saying this aligns with a business model that Microsoft apparently believes is the future of gaming.
Niiiiice, I finally get to play Halo games after Halo 2
[removed]
PSA for those concerned about the Xbox Live requirement on Steam: 

You don't need Xbox Live Gold to play online for Gears of War or Forza on PC. It's very unlikely you'll be paying for Xbox Live Gold to play Halo Multiplayer.
[deleted]
Steam and Windows store? I wonder how the player bases will work then. 
As someone who never had any Xbox and therefor never had the chance to play Halo, I'm really happy about this. Especially the Steam part. Imagine if Epic had gotten it...
Damn  you guys are fast.

&#x200B;

Altough i already played the shit out of MCC on Xbox, i would love to play it all again on PC, that's how much i love Halo
This is incredible. An entire new generation gets to play a remastered Halo series. I can't wait to tell my brother, we played through the entire campaign halo 1- reach on legendary but since we moved out neither of us have touched halo in years . . . this is going to be amazing.
Halo Reach is being added as well! This is fantastic! An almost complete Halo collection on the PC, and on Steam. Amazing. 
If I own it digitally on Xbox is it free or do I have to rebuy it?
Steam page has gone live and whats worrying is that the side-bar only says "Single-player" "Online-multiplayer" "Online co-op"

Hoping this doesn't rule out splitscreen :(
[Holy shit, my dudes. The steam page is up. This is real.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/)

> Now built for PC with mouse and keyboard support and up to 4K UHD and HDR, this is the collection Halo fans have been waiting for! 

Understatement of the fucking decade
That is very, very interesting. No one would object to a Winstore only release. Even those nutjobs on /r/pcgaming were willing to install Win10 for it.

Regardless, I like it. Very cool of Microsoft.
Rolling out the games one by one will also keep the matchmaking really tight without everyone spreading out through the game modes too much. I think that‚Äôs a good thing!
PIZZA.

Didnt expect steam but im glad it is on there. I have it on xbox so ill just get it through WS. 


Really hoping for campaing crossplay

I have been waiting for this for over a decade. The nostalgia of going back and playing halo with friends, the memory of that... it's enough to bring a tear to my eye. This is my favorite announcement in years.
Too bad John Bain never got to see this. I remember how Boogie2988 pushed a lot on MS to bring Halo to PC. Good on MS to finally do this and give us an awesome collection. Hopefully full mouse and keyboard support as well as controller support and properly optimized. Busy working on a total overhaul I hope in both graphics and post processing effects. 
This and Sunset Overdrive were the reasons I bought an Xbone. Both are on PC. At least I free dubbed anime that I'll never watch.
Will it be available on PC through Xbox game pass?
I can't even describe how happy I am when a long time console exclusive of an amazing series gets a port to another platform. Man the gaming world would be so much fun if exclusives weren't a thing. I know it's not realistic and will never happen though.
Everyone loves Microsoft right now. 

Microsoft and Nintendo teaming up to put Sony in their place. 

Microsoft and Steam teaming up to put Epic in their place. 
Interestingly on the steam page it says

https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/

"Requires 3rd-Party Account: Xbox Live "

They must have found a method for using your XBL account on Steam, this means there is no reason all the other xbox games couldn't be on Steam also!
holy shit, this is mindblowing news. a release on pc was all in the cards, but steam just blows me away. it's so good to be excited for video games again
Holy shit people have been asking for Halo 3 on PC for over a decade. It's nuts to think it would happen after so long. 
Did they confirm this to be a play anywhere title or will I have to rebuy it if I own it digitally on XB1?
Will it be XPA and will steam cross play with windows store? Those are the only questions I have. 
Huh. I guess I can finally check out the series. Never had an Xbox but I did play Halo 2 a bit with a friend years ago when he had it.  So, now I'll be able to see why people love it so much.
FINALLY.

I haven't played a Halo game in years at this point, and I'm very surprised that it's coming to steam and not some other shitty ass DRM
I said "WHAT?!" out loud when reading that. I am blown away. Fantastic move, I can't wait to play them.
So I remember reading that when MCC released on xbone, there were a ton of issues that were still there a while after release. Were those issues ever fixed? Worried that those same issues will be there on PC as well.
We have Atlus starting to look at PC, the Phoenix Wright Trilogy releasing soon and now this. It's looking very nice for PC picking up these games it never got at the moment. 
so they referred to the staggered release, does this mean that the games won't come as a collection, and we'll have to buy them piecemeal?
If I were Microsoft, I'd definitely use Game Pass to my advantage. You'd get Master Chief Collection on Steam if you want it, but it'll be $60. But, if you get it with Game Pass, it's only $15, and you get a whole bunch of other games along with it. The key difference being that you can only download it from the Microsoft Store if you get it from Game Pass.

If you were extra sinister, you could also make a very public offer to allow Game Pass enabled games to be downloaded through Steam, if the user links their Xbox Account to their Steam Account. Valve obviously won't go for it without some sort of financial incentive, but you keep the pressure on Valve to let it happen for super cheap, if not free by acting as the champion of the consumer, while showing up Valve as the greedy ones.
I only ever played halo 1 on PC, and avoided the second due to windows live issues or whatever happened way back then. Ive always been a PC player and don‚Äôt care much for consoles so I waited for this port. For 15 long years, I‚Äôve waited... and now finally very soon I can continue the story and find out what happens.

I can‚Äôt express the excitement I‚Äôm currently having, I would argue it would be equal to if Half Life 3 was announced. 
Did not expect it to come out on Steam. Disappointed it's not coming out all at once ‚Äî I was sure that's a given after so much time in development. Oh well, at least we're getting it.
Is it the campaign only or is there multiplayer?
Cross play with XBOX by any chance?
I already own it on XBox and would seriously consider buying it again on Steam, unless it will automatically be unlocked for PC users with Play Anywhere on Microsoft's store.
We shall all experience the Great Journey and rejoice in our Ascension. The great Forerunners have given us magnificent gifts that we shall all prosper from.
Oh shit, what? This is a buy, no questions asked. Only reason to click the headline is to check for a date.
Holy shit, not only do we get Halo 1 to 4 but also Reach!

60 FPS + 4K confirmed too, man this is going to be a day 1 purchase for me, no question about it.
Amazing. I've been waiting for this moment for years. I'm expecting it'll be Windows 10 only and honestly...this might finally be the thing that makes me upgrade from 7.
So if reach is getting added does that mean 60fps reach?
Awesome news, but on a slightly unrelated note, I wonder if Microsoft has interest in making a movie/movie series that tells the original story of Halo now that MCC is more accessible. Dem remastered cutscenes in Halo 2 look TOO GOOD. I personally believe it has the potential of being one of the only GOOD movies based off of a video game. I feel like Halo is going to come back strong for many years to come, and the series will get many new fans once Halo Infinite releases
Is this going to have split screen? would love to play with my partner, but there's no way her laptop would run it. 
I'm very surprised they didn't make it a Windows Store exclusive (like Forza or Gears). I wonder if there is something to read between the lines here about either of the stores. 
From a non PC gamer - could someone enlighten me as to what is the importance of it being released on steam? 
Microsoft is making some big grasps at market share and it‚Äôs definitely working. They could potentially surpass PlayStation‚Äôs lead by going after PC gamers. It‚Äôs really smart actually. Hopefully Sony will realize this and sell their games on Steam, too. :)
I've never played HALO, so Im curious, why is Reach such a big deal? And why would it be in the collection if it's part of HALO? It makes sense for it to be there, so why such a big deal?
/r/Games is closed for April Fool‚Äôs. Find out why in here!
#Not April Fool‚Äôs. 

This April Fool‚Äôs, we decided to take things a little more seriously and shed some light on a growing, pervasive issue that has affected the community of r/Games and gaming communities as a whole. In recent times, it‚Äôs come to our attention that what has been intended to be a forum for the potential spread of knowledge and involvement in video games has instead become a battleground of conflicting ideas. Ordinarily, this isn‚Äôt an issue; discussion by its very nature is certain to bring argument, but when that argument descends into vitriolic attacks between individuals on a regular basis with no chance at deescalation, that‚Äôs when, put simply, something‚Äôs got to give.

Though certain memes (such as ‚Äúgamers rise up‚Äù) surrounding gaming are largely viewed as a humorous interpretation of a mindset, at the core of the humor is a set of very serious issues that affect all gaming enthusiasts. By showing disdain or outright rejecting minority and marginalized communities, we become more insular. In this, we lose out on the chance to not only show compassion to these people, but also the chance to grow our own community and diversify the demographics of those involved in it. Whether it‚Äôs misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, racism or a host of other discriminatory practices, now is the time to stymie the flow of regressive ideas and prevent them from ever becoming the norm.

At r/Games, our community is becoming increasingly responsible for perpetuating a significant amount of these combative and derogatory schools of thought. We remove those comments, we ban the perpetrators, but the issue still persists at a fundamental level: the notion that it‚Äôs okay or acceptable to ridicule and demonize traditionally disenfranchised and marginalized members in the gaming community. This is not just an issue in r/Games or on Reddit alone; this is an issue deeply embedded in the ranging depths of the internet, frequently in communities that center around the discussion of games.

##What We See

Unfortunately, this inflammatory content is not an infrequent occurrence. The condescending, dismissive, vindictive and pessimistic attitudes we see in our day to day activity is troubling, especially when those interactions involve harassing or outright targeting regularly discriminated communities. It‚Äôs not uncommon for us to see the real issues surrounding these communities be trivialized, derided out of ignorance, or worse, for the sake of entertainment.

To that end, we want to show you, the community, what we mean by ‚Äúwhat we see‚Äù. These are some of the more awful comments we see regarding [transphobia](https://i.imgur.com/HPS9DKW.png), [homophobia](https://i.imgur.com/S1FGkbd.jpg), [islamophobia](https://i.imgur.com/YNxb69G.jpg), [racism](https://i.imgur.com/MdIZgNn.jpg), [misogyny](https://i.imgur.com/TVd4DKx.jpg), [pro-pedophilia/pro-rape](https://i.imgur.com/2l4Rdxk.jpg), and [vitriolic personal attacks against other users](https://i.imgur.com/Q0qrIVJ.jpg). These kinds of comments occur on a daily basis. [We‚Äôve compiled an entire album of examples](https://imgur.com/a/umrdBYF) of the horrible things people say on this subreddit. From bigotry to vitriol, this album merely scratches the surface of the magnitude of the problem.

In the interest of providing examples, we elected to remove the usernames from these comments; instead, our intent is to show the stark reality that we face on a daily basis in the overall effort to provide a welcoming and responsive community. Preventing the cultivation of bigotry means giving it no ground to go to, and as a whole leave only space for those who would respectfully participate. We must closely examine our own communities, in an effort to encourage acceptance and inclusion, to foster a healthy community in which we value empathy and respect. 




##Do Better; Be Better

Despite the strife that‚Äôs both within and caused by our community, there are a multitude of opportunities to prove that we can come together and be a more wholesome, accepting community that exists on a single core idea: enjoying and discussing video games together. Though the industry as a whole has suffered a great deal of trials and tribulations, we also are fortunate enough to be at a point in time in which there seem to be a glut of fantastic games, from major AAA titles down to near-anonymous indie projects that come out of nowhere. 

So let‚Äôs revel in what‚Äôs available to us, and also appreciate the myriad of backgrounds that we as gamers come from. Our differences in experiences comprise the diversity in the content that we consume, and by allowing ourselves to appreciate those differences, we change our perspectives and interpretations; this applies not only in games, but life as a whole.

Let‚Äôs not let the good eggs go unnoticed, though: There are plenty of you who, as members of the community, want to take care of one another. Sometimes this means identifying when conversation becomes confrontation, when discussion gets out of hand and turns to name-calling, slurs or other degrading language. To you, we say thank you. You‚Äôre what keep us going, you‚Äôre who we want to see more of, and you‚Äôre everything that is the potential for a strong, open community for those who love and enjoy video games the way we do.

It‚Äôs also important to recognize the opportunities not afforded to everyone, as well as the resources available to give them a helping hand. So this April Fool‚Äôs, we‚Äôre also asking you to take into consideration the idea of helping these organizations out. These folks have made it their mission to represent and benefit those who still face their own challenges, obstacles and prejudices, and any assistance they can get is another step forward for their cause.

For those curious, yes we will have a meta thread for a discussion when the sub reopens. Stay tuned tomorrow for that.
Jason Schreier: "Following the success of Jedi Fallen Order and the failure of Anthem, EA has allowed BioWare to make the next Dragon Age a single-player RPG. Previously, it was planned as a service game"

Good news. Players have limited time and can only usually fit one service game at any point in time, single player experiences coexist with that much better than trying to elbow your way into that space again and again
I don't think there was a better summation of the last generation than the fact that everything tried to be Destiny when even Destiny sucked at being Destiny.
How far along in development is DA4? It being not GaaS is good news for fans, but BioWare has a track record of making sweeping directional changes partway through development, and that's a bad idea for any studio, especially one that most recently put out Anthem.
That's a good sign if you ask me, I know Anthem must sting a lot but I'm really happy to see them focusing on the single player aspect of this one. Hopefully it can be a real return to form for BioWare, they definitely need one.
Holy crap. Trying to imagine how Dragon Age 4 could have been successful as a service game makes my head hurt. There just isn't a good way to do Dragon Age's epic world-altering style of storytelling in a game where there has to be thousands of players and you kill the same boss 20 times.

"Looks like we're farming the Dread Wolf again this week!"
After the recent trailer called the game Dragon Age without a subtitle, I was extremely worried about it being another GAAS. After anthem, this is absolutely the right choice to make as the last thing BioWare needs is another live service game as the GAAS market becomes more and more oversaturated.
I‚Äôll remain incredibly cautious, but that is very good news.
[deleted]
This is huge. I've been following the articles Jason wrote about DA and Bioware for a while, the game went from a single player rpg that devs were super excited about to yet another GaaS described as "Anthem with dragons", and now we are going back to a single player focused RPG

I've always been excited about DA and the fact that Bioware was allowed to go back to its roots is great, my only concern is that so many changes in such a short period of time aren't always a good sign.

Edit: grammar
"Allowed" is an interesting way to phrase this. I was under the impression that the decision to do Anthem as a GaaS came from Bioware and was not imposed top-down by EA.
I am appalled they were even considering making a Dragon Age GaaS. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. It's honestly unfathomable at times how out of touch certain publishers are.
This is good but still doesn't mean Bioware will manage much better. They nearly fumbled DA: I due to mismanagement but coasted by on luck and crunch. ME: A was kind of a mess. 

And on top of all that they've been hemorrhaging developers and directors. I just don't think there's enough Bioware left to make much well.
A good example of 'vote with your wallet', IMO. Happy to hear it. I'm slightly more cautiously optimistic about the new Dragon Age.
This is why I celebrate when games like Anthem or Avengers fail. Not to be mean, but because if they don't fail, they ruin everything else.
It turns out that Anthem truly was the chosen one, and in its dying act has restored balance to the force.
Good news for Dragon Age and BioWare‚Äôs future, but I can‚Äôt help but worry about the state of this incoming Dragon Age game. Flip flopping between single player and a service game means there‚Äôs not been much consistency in direction and management. How likely is it that BioWare is going to end up in a situation very similar to that of Andromeda and Inquisition? Where they use their ‚ÄúBioWare Magic‚Äù (aka exploitation of their employees and naive hope that everything just..: works out) to squeeze out a playable game with lots of issues.

Still, better that they try salvage what‚Äôs there as what it should have been from the very beginning. Ultimately, I think this is a good change.
Why the fuck would Dragon Age have ever been an online game in the first place?

Like, I don't think EA is universally bad or stupid or whatnot, but it boggles my mind that they can have a successful franchise like Dragon Age and not understand at all why people actually like it.
Concerned about how much of that old formula is still implemented in the game, leftovers that can weigh the game down a lot.
"EA has allowed BioWare to do the thing they're good at and the reason they were purchased in the first place"
Daily reminder. There is no more "BIOWARE MAGIC". Bioware felt from grace. they are no more great game company. mediocre is best. and they will big probably going to butcher DA also. The company who made kotors and origin and ma is no more. do not pre-order their games.
"Why were you cheering Anthem's failure?" That's why.
Good to see this confirmed beyond doubt. 

I loved Inquisition and I hope they take the best lessons possible from that game - what worked (Trespasser, visuals, soundtrack, character and companion customisation) and what didn‚Äôt (the open world, weak villain). 

If Frostbite can handle it, I would love to see a Final Fantasy 12-style tactics system (with a better tactical camera) and smaller locales. But larger cities! Val Royeux was far too small aha.

If you haven‚Äôt noticed, I love dragon age. Really hopeful and optimistic about DA4!
Fallen Order shouldn‚Äôt have been as successful as it was. It barely did the bare minimum, but I guess that‚Äôs how low the bar is. I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it.
Good. I hope more of these gaming as a service games flop. Whole system seems predatory to me and the less of it there is the better.
[deleted]
Especially funny considering EA for all intents and purposes once held a stance that single player was on the way out.

If this allows DA4 to be good, then Anthem didn‚Äôt die in vain.
EA constantly being shocked that good single players games will actually sell well is the most pathetic fucking trope in this industry. 

Every few years they try to convince people single player games are dead, usually by releasing a stinker of a title in some twisted, self-fulfilling prophetic tomfoolery, then one of their studios some how manages to slip a decent game out without them realizing and they get all shocked pikachu. 

Fucking dumbasses.
I'm not too familiar with the Dragon Age IP, but everything I've read about and seen demonstrated that it was the complete opposite of a GAAS.

Was I wrong with assumption? Because making it a GAAS seems like a stupid idea to begin with.
the old bioware is basically gone, most people that brought us the mass effect trilogy and dragon age are gone.

I really wouldn't hype this up as much, I'd love a great singleplayer RPG,but I think it has a big chance of being just as mediocre as Andromeda was, no matter if live service or not.
Hopefully they have time to make it a true BioWare RPG. I don‚Äôt want to play another single player MMO.
So to clarify, EA and Dice screwed up the launch of Battlefront 2, which led to fan backlash against that, and Disney getting mad with how EA was handling their property, leading to Jedi Fallen Order being Single Player and profitable. Anthem, the live service game, meanwhile flopped.

So in a weird twisted way, Disney inadvertently saved Dragon Age 4.
excellent news, it‚Äôs been forever since a singleplayer game by Bioware with Mass Effect Andromeda... oh
what? Dragon Age meant to be live service game? EA is seriously fucked in the head... That's just pure evil BS.

Luckily live service game are dropping like flies - Marvel Avengers with such a strong franchise name and still flopped hard. GOOD, nobody wants these lazy cash milking machines.
Aw fuck yeah, there goes a bunch of my reservations about the game.

I'm speaking as someone that enjoyed Inquisition & even MEA to an extent, so I don't consider BioWare a lost cause.
This feels like pandering and capitalizing on Anthem's failure. I can't help but feel like this misses the point. Anthem isn't bad because it was a 'game as a service', it was bad for tons of other reasons. This also doesn't mean Dragon Age will automatically be good, it's still BioWare afterall and they botched the development cycle for Anthem.
I know this comment will get buried, but...

This is stupid.  So stupid.  Here's why:

> Time for some news that is going to make BioWare fans really happy.

No shit.  This should not exist.  Fans shouldn't be happy because a game that was being planned one way is now being planned completely differently, because iT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKING PLANNED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME.  "You guys will be happy to hear that we're not going to do the thing you guys passionately hate anymore!"  To me, this reads "we decided to make a game that is actually good instead of a game that will exploit you".  They *wanted* to make a money grab, but they realized that their money grab wouldn't work, so they went for plan B, which is to make a game that's actually good, because that was their plan B.

Whatever, I don't play AAA games anyway.  It doesn't really make a difference to me.  But I don't think this kind of decision should be celebrated.  On the other hand, the fact that the decision was forced by a "service game" being unsuccessful -- and a good game being successful -- is a good thing.  That's good news.  That's a victory on our part.
I like how EA only seems to do what has been successful for other publishers without any consideration for why it was successful.  It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre lead by robots.
Frankly, I don't know why more huge game companies don't follow Sony's example. For many years now, Sony have apparently given their internal studios a relatively high amount of creative freedom, and the result has been consistent success of Playstation exclusives. For PS4, it's been almost nothing but back-to-back critical and financial successes for them.

**Guerrilla Games**

Guerrilla Games spent years making Killzone games. If Sony wanted to, they could have ordered GG to continue making Killzone games, or try to make a Killzone-branded live service game, but they didn't. Instead, they gave them the freedom to make Horizon: Zero Dawn, which was an immediate smash hit, as well as one of the go-to games to show off how beautiful PS4 games could be.

Horizon: Zero Dawn is single-player only.

**Santa Monica Studio**

Santa Monica Studio has been making God of War games for 18 years now. For a long time, GoW titles were pretty mindless hack & slash action games about a mindless, raging, homicidal, vengeance-obsessed, maniac named Kratos killing every god and monster from Greek mythology.

But in the years leading up to 2018, they were given the freedom to go in a different direction with a new God of War. They changed the game type to an action / adventure game with RPG elements. Gameplay became a little slower-paced and a little more strategic. The setting was moved from fantasy Greece to fantasy Norway, and Greek mythology was swapped out for Norse. Player's were given a companion‚ÄîKratos's son, Atreus. And Kratos was changed from a murderous, screaming wacko to a quiet, brooding, grizzled old warrior who's haunted by his past and struggling to deal with his new role as the only living parent of a demigod child.

God of War 2018 surprised a lot of people, including myself, and it was a big critical and commercial hit. It's also single-player only.

**Sucker Punch Productions**

Sucker Punch started by making Sly Cooper games, a cartoony adventure game about a master thief raccoon. Around the time they got acquired by Sony, they started making Infamous games, which were open-world superhero games. 

Sony could have ordered Sucker Punch to continue making games in either series, but instead they gave them the freedom to try something totally different, and last year SP came out with Ghost of Tsushima, a stunning game about a samurai fighting to defend his home against invading Mongols. Ghost of Tsushima was another critical and commercial success for Sony, and even though it was made by a western studio, [it was praised by Japanese game critics](https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-is-being-praised-by-japanese-critics-1844387298) for its portrayal of 13th Japan.

Ghost of Tsushima started off as single-player only, but DLC unlocks a multiplayer mode.

**Naughty Dog**

Naughty Dog was given the creative freedom to go from Crash freakin' Bandicoot and Jak & Daxter to the Uncharted series and The Last of Us. That's one hell of a giant leap, and it paid off. 

They were also given the freedom to get really fucking dark with The Last of Us story. Reactions to the story were highly mixed, but nobody can argue that the Last of Us games were not successful.

Some of Naughty Dog games are single-player only, while others have multiplayer.

So throughout the Playstation 4 generation, Sony has enjoyed a great deal of success by allowing their internal studios to have the creative freedom to make the games they want. There does not seem to be a multiplayer mandate, and there certainly doesn't seem to be a live service mandate. 

It's work for Sony, so I see no reason why it shouldn't work for other huge companies. For whatever reason, other huge companies are ignoring Sony's example, and many of them are failing because of it.
I mean the title this time literally says volumes this time. If somehow anthem had succeded. EA would have forced BioWare to ruin dragon age. 

Service games are good. They're fun and have a lot of social longevity. 

Dragon age is not a service game franchise. Why. The fuck. Would this change happen? I mean money of course. We all know EA is Soulless. It's just nice of them to remind us every so often. 

I no longer hope for anything BioWare makes to be good. Not like it was a long time ago. EA is currently in the business of driving nails into a coffin for them.
MEA and DAI were both singleplayer RPGs and imo that didn't do anything to make them not really bad compared to the old games. 
 KOTOR, ME, DA... BioWare has taken a massive sticky dump on every awesome franchise they made in the early 2000s.  They made a new one (Anthem) and shit the bed their too.

I don't think anything matter as long as the BioWare logo is on the box.  That's the issue.  The problem is the developer, not the format.
That's cool and all.

Still, I have very little faith that the current Bioware can pull off a good game.
The best they seem to be able to do these days is serviceable to ok.
Is the game industry finally starting to get it?
... can we get a single player Anthem?

Or something Anthem adjacent?  The GAAS model absolutely broke that game, but it had a lot of potential. The flight and combat mechanics were a ton of fun, and a few of the NPCs were kind of interesting until they turned into bog-standard daily rep grinds.
"Service game" is just modern speak for MMO. You'd think publishers and studios would have noticed by now that the massively multiplayer game space is littered with the corpses of failed games and bankrupt studios. There's only been like, maximum 5 success stories in that space in the last 15 years.
I can't facepalm hard enough. 'allowed'. EA buys a single player rpg company, stops them from doing just that for ten years(also forces use of an fps engine for rpg) and swaps all production mid way through after they realise they're idiots. 

I wonder what effed up remnants it'll have in it from the once-service-now-single-player-rpg-functions they'll have to half remove but couldn't remove entirely due to time/budget. 

I'd be less pissed if the only good rpgs that have come out since mass effect 3 wasn't 2 games. Divinity 2 and Disco Elysium. It turns out I just really miss old bioware. 

Moronic EA. Bioware is the dumbest company in earth for selling to them years back. I'm so mad they've turned into this joke. 

Hey, silver linings maybe dragon age 4 will actually exist now.
Titanfall 2 will not have a season pass, all post-launch maps and content will be free

This statement alone might get me to buy the game, if just to support the practice.

Good on Respawn/EA
As someone that usually thinks "eh I'll wait for GOTY with all the DLC bundled" and then in half the cases either forgets about it or finds out that the servers have already become ghost towns by that point, this quite piques my interest.

Still gonna wait until people have had the game in their hands for some time, but if it seems like a fun game, this definitely makes me want to buy it sooner rather than later (or maybe never).
Looks like the gaming industry still has a little bit of soul left. I almost want to buy the game just to support this practice.
Looks to be an amazing game already, so this is just the icing on the cake.

Plus, there's no bullshit blind box loot system.

I'll support devs like Respawn. Going to pick this up tomorrow.

EDIT: I WAS WRONG. THERE IS A LOOT BOX SYSTEM. FUCK.

 It's called "Advocate Gifts", and they can be won in a 1v1 arena that can only be accessed by spending "tickets" that you win in multiplayer or purchase for real money. Some customization items are only available in advocate gifts.

So in other games you pay for a chance to get a skin you want.

Now you have to pay for a chance to have a chance to get a skin you want?

FUCK

EDIT 2: I guarantee they will sell Advocate Gifts for real money at some point.

EDIT 3: they say won't sell gifts. Gifts can be attained from different sources in game. Loot aside tge game plays like a dream.
Am I crazy or was this known a very long time ago? I recall Vince saying it shortly after development on TF1 finished.
Damn, even the reviews have been excellent. I am really tempted to pick this up ,especially, since I detest the Season Pass bullshit so much.
I was still a little on the fence, but now I want this game. Would you recommend the PC or PS4 version?
Whoa this is huge! One commonly cited reason for Titanfall's failure was the splitting of its player base via paid DLC. The dev's seem like they're doing their best to address concerns
What a fucking massive win for the industry. Dunno abut the guys behind this title, but from this fact alone they should be praised. Not to say season passes should be done away with outright, because they can be done well, but should this practice become common, it'll restore a shitload of trust back into the industry from everyone.

Good on these guys.
Dang, Titanfall 2 really seems like it's knocking things out of the park lately. Major focus on single-player, awesome new titans, free DLC... Looks like they've definitely learned from the first game.
is this even an EA game anymore? what the fuck dude
Impressive, also considering that in bf 1 there are no microtransactions. There are loot boxes and weapon skins but all of that is earned by playing. Have to give it up to EA.
Plants vs zombies garden warfare series has been doing this since the beginning. A really fun shooter that gets ignored. Honestly, EA gets bashed on too much for no reason. 
i need to pick this up at some point. kind of dumb of ea to release this as the same time as battlefield 1 though, since thats what i've been playing pretty exclusively lately
Everyone, listen to the amazing soundtrack. It feels like Dances with Titans.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDEHx5zAzk

I think the coolest thing about this model as opposed to charging people for a season pass is that you're pretty much guaranteed to see people happy over the free content you put out which will then boost sales by word of mouth. 

When you pay $40-50 for a pass you become super critical over what you get from it. You'll bitch and complain because you don't feel you're getting your money's worth sometimes. 

This model fosters a much happier and more supportive fan base. 
This is great. Between this and other major releases (Halo 5) moving away from paid MP DLC it may be a sign the industry is starting to turn away from that business strategy.   While I didn't like HOW Halo's pack system worked, it was still a positive in that all future multiplayer DLC was "free."

What we have to watch for now, however, is the explosion of microtransactions.  Make no mistake about it, the publishers will want to make up the cost of development through other means and those will likely be microtransactions that go beyond cosmetics.  Halo 5's microtransactions were certainly not just cosmetic.  They dropped weapons and items that were better than the standard loadouts.
Doing map-packs splits your player base. Find other ways to make money after purchase. There are plenty in a first person shoter
Bethesda making anti-consumer decisions while EA comes in being pro-consumer. We have entered the weirdest timeline
[deleted]
I was on the fence between getting Titanfall2 or Battlefield 1. This news swings me towards TF2 a lot more. Knowing how much BF pushes map DLC and other expansions, having free maps seems like a great way to keep the player base together.
Ok, this is huge news (it's sad that it's huge news), I might buy this at full price now JUST to support this practice.  We need to stop with this DLC bullshit.
why is this going big suddenly ? this was known for months now 
Nice.  Following the Halo 5 model which is probably the best way I've ever seen free-DLC + microstransactions done in a game.
This is good. EA really trust in Respawn, even after Titanfall 1 fast decay they supported a second one and now free content and no Season Pass. Lets hope that this is a step in the right direction and not a one time event.
I support companies that do this!

I was hesitant to buy the game because I just got BF1, but I'll probably end up getting it now that they're doing this.
It's crazy how much money CoD is rolling in with a $60 game and $50 season pass each year in addition to microstransactions. The fact that people are willing to do that is just ludicrous to me.
This is exactly what the gaming world needs right now.

Although the big outlets will tell you otherwise, I think gaming is at a serious crisis point. Big companies are increasingly leaning on marketing gimmicks to maximise revenue, such as the unholy triple threat: pre-order bonuses, unnecessary DLC and microtransactions.

Gamers don't want this. Fans don't want this. It doesn't improve anyone's experience, and all it does is negatively affect the value for money received by consumers.

Having spoken to people within the industry, this practice seems to be here to stay for the time being and marketing strategies are being devised around how to maximise profitability through these methods. The mains culprits (EA, Relic Entertainment, hell maybe even Valve with their item drops) will only sit up and take notice when the consumer starts voting with their wallet; sending the message that we do not want this, and it is not OK to rip gamers off in this manner.
Did respawn fix any of the issues people had with the Beta?

I was told they got rid of the bots during multiplayer, but i saw in the Gamespot review that they mentioned once about the bots.

The bots in my opinion were the best part of the first game, made you actually feel like you were in a futuristic war zone.  It's be a shame if it was just a COD cone with giant mech suits.
The only thing holding me back from buying the game is that it might end up dying like titanfall 1. I really wish it was on origin access, it'd be great for the game.
I was on the fence between getting Call of Duty or not.  I haven't purchased since Black Ops 2 and was hoping to get back into the fun.  That being said, I'm not feeling like shelling out $100 for the complete experience.  

With this statement, I'm firmly on board with Titanfall 2 instead.
This is great news, it's a shame EA couldn't have this same policy for BF1, but they know they'll make a shit load of money from Premium so I guess it's not too surprising. If you're going to move forward you might as well use both feet. 
I'm buying this game no questions now. I loved the first games multiplayer (attrition!!), the campaign is getting rave reviews, after the beta red pawn seems to *actually* have listened to the feedback and changed the game up, and now this?

Respawn, this is fantastic.
Am I dreaming? No, seriously... This is fucking incredible, a video game company in [CURRENT YEAR] are **NOT** being money grubbing sharks? I... I need to sit down, this is amazing.

I didn't think companies these days had the balls to pull off something like this. Just... Wow.
i was going to buy their game, but now this is how they win a loyal customer. I will buy their game and suggest it to all my friends. 

Coming from an EA published game, it's surprising.
Battlefield 3 had originally advertised saying they would not have dlc or map packs to one up COD, then a few months later day one dlc was announced...

I'll believe it when i see it but for now I'll just watch and see.
What does season pass mean in the context of video games?
I haven't played the first one, do you think this will be worth getting?
You know what? I've never bought a big-budget AAA shooter Day 1. I don't have EA Origin on my computer. I think Titanfall 2 is going to change that.
I gotta admit it's a pretty damn good idea if the intent you're really going for is to get people really into the brand that you are now offering on both major third party consoles for the first time. I could theoretically see this not being the case if 2 is very successful and they make a 3, but given that they wanna grow the audience it sure isn't a bad move.
It's a little sad when everyone gets excited about a feature that should absolutely be the standard, not the exception. 
Well, that just won a preorder from me where I was initially gonna wait for a price drop. Good on you, Respawn and EA
Has Hell frozen over? EA actually passed on an opportunity to make more money?

Pleasantly surprised by this...
This is surprising, I'll be honest.

Taking into consideration

- They are published by EA who **love** season passes and pillaging people's wallets before the games are even released
- The development team are mostly ex. Infinity Ward, who did a lot of season passes/ map packs etc for their COD games.

One of the biggest complaints about Titanfall 1 was that the map DLC's were segregating the player base, causing long queue times.

Actually, thinking about it, they have been really making a lot of changes to make this game much better than the last.

- Adding Single Player campaign 
- More mech options 
- More overall customization options
- Free DLC

All of the above were valid complaints about the previous game.

It's clear that they listened to player feedback and criticism of their previous game. And you have to give them props for that. They want this game to succeed, that is very clear with the changes they have made. 
So, the opposite of any dice game where it seems to be a personal challenge to splinter the fan base as soon as humanly possible with a metric fuck ton of overpriced DLC
Still no server browser or user run servers so will be dead on PC just as quick as the first one using playlists.
What about microtransactions? This is EA, they'll stick it to us somehow...
Are there microtransactions or "loot" crates? I find it hard to believe that ALL content will be free...
Pretty clear even before TF1 was done its cycle that Respawn was learning that its original map pack in the early days of the game just did not go well for it. IIRC, the extra maps went free, at least for a little while. It's good to see companies learning from their mistakes and taking the growing pains.
Really enjoyed Titanfall when it came out. Was thinking of waiting a few months to get the GOTY/DLC bundled edition on sale, but if that's not gonna be the case then I may just pick this up. 
So smart. Go for a big day one sale instead of trying to squeeze out drips and drabs of sales. 

Hopefully EA knows theres an expiration date on these games that goes well beyond the season pass. 
Is there a demo on PC so I can make sure I like the game play before I buy?
Well they certainly didn't sell much of the original's DLC and then gave it away for free .... but even then no one played it because the population was too low.  

It's a good idea though.  Definitely does something to separate them from the fact that they're releasing right smack in the middle of Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: IW.  
Looks like EA has been paying attention to the love that Nintendo has gotten for this practice with Splatoon. Good on you, EA.
Yes, but will it have pay to win microtransaction packs that include performance enhancing items that you can buy?

If they have free post-launch maps (and a decent amount of them) and purely cosmetic micro's, then I'm all on board. The Overwatch pay model works, if you create good content.
Not bad for "The Worst Company In America". Not bad at all. 

Maybe that's how EA expects the game to sell against BF1 and COD this year?
