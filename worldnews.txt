An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window

It feels like the “vehemently homophobic politician being super gay” is an extension of the upper class “for thee but not for me”. Am i alone in thinking that?
“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?
Officers, thank god you're here! Those men, they tried to have sex with me!!
He had drugs in his bag too. Damn, what a party.
> A source in the local police told the newspaper: "We interrupted a gang bang."

Great newspaper quotes of our time.
> Szájer, who fronted Fidesz in the European Parliament, helped rewrite Hungary's constitution to "protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman,"

Because of course, it's not enough for themselves to be in the closet, they need everyone else with them and if they won't hide who they are then they must be shamed.

Fuck this guy.

Which apparently happens in quantity.
25 men is a lot of men for a homophobe
Shame that the story came from businessinsider. It should be businessinsidim.
“He announced his resignation as an MEP on Sunday, and asked people to treat the matter as "strictly personal" to him.

"I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community," he added.”

So “strictly personal” for him but not any other person that is LGBTQ.  Got it. 

“Oh and please don’t tell the people back home I’m a fucking hypocrite”.
Talk about your super spreader events...
Hahaha Imagine explaining that! “Guys, I was running because I realized the women never came!”
Two dozen I could understand, but 25?  That's perverse!
>"I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community," he added.

Given all his anti-LGBTQI history. I think they deserve to know that he is a raging hypocrite.
Why is this SUCH a consistent thing? Anti-gay politician turns out to be hella gay. Just why?
That‘s like fiddy balls.
It's not gay, if it's in a 3-way. 

\*checks if 3 divides evenly into 25\*
Every second week their seems to be a hungarian politician doing something really fucked up, which is really odd for a country that size lol.
If they had said "It was an orgy that involved sexual acts between 7 men" I would have been like "WHOA! The anti-gay guy, 7 dudes? That's a lot!!" 

But it's 25. 25 men. A 25 man orgy. That's not an orgy, that's Carnival level.

(A note. Being gay, totally awesome and fine. So are orgies, straight or gay. But the thick layer of goddamn hypocrisy covering the whole thing is indefensible and unforgivable.)
The worst part isn't that he was caught in 25-man orgy , the worst part is that he was a hypocrite
Just to provide some context as a Hungarian. He is a representative of the ruling Hungarian Christian democratic party, explicitly calling themselves an "illiberal democracy". The same party that people like Steve Bannon used as a model of how right-wing populism could defeat liberals. 

For example, this is the same party that actually first [built a wall \(or rather a fence\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier) in Europe to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country.

This is the same party that transformed state media to serve the party and broadcast pro-government propaganda. The same party that through private investors and oligarchs bought out most media outlets within the country effectively making it impossible for Hungarians to inform themselves impartially and as result, these events about the MEP are not broadcasted practically anywhere. If you ever wondered what Trump's presidency would look like in the future, how democracy and its institutions can be slowly destroyed, just look at Hungary.
And with this, 2020 sucks a little bit less <3
Oh how the tables have turned!
"So there I was innocently sitting having dinner and suddenly a 25 man orgy erupted around me! Escaping through the window was all I could do!"

I guess?
Up next: Mike Pence
That’s fucking hilarious
Signs you might be gay:

* You hate gay people
* You hate them so much that you can't stop thinking/talking about them
* You hate them so much that you want to go places they have sex so you can tell them how much you hate them
* You hate them so much that you decide to stick your dick in their ass to punish them for being gay
* You hate them so much that you decide to suck some dicks just to show them how dumb they are for liking it
I'd have no issue with a politician admitting to taking part in orgies if it wasn't that he's a hypocrite and breaking Covid lockdown rules.
how do 25 people even have sex together? If you participate in it do you hope to have interacted with all 24 of them by the end?
Obviously he fled. He was the odd man out.
That's not an orgy, that's damn near a Royal Rumble.
It’s like I always say, “you can’t flee a 25 man orgy by window. The only way out is through”
Mike Pence is going to clip out this article and keep it under his pillow to read when his wife falls asleep.
Those who cry the loudest amitire
He was there along with "a number of diplomats". He was just being diplomatic. How could one say no to a friendly 25 men orgy for his country.
Not very surprising. If you are that focused on other people’s sexual preferences, it is a dead giveaway that you are either trying to control your own urges, a complete idiot, or, as is most often the case, both.
'He announced his resignation as an MEP and asked people to treat the matter as "strictly personal" to him."

Sorry, but if you devote your career as a politician to being anti-gay and then are forced to resign because you're in an orgy with a double-digit number of men, you don't get to keep this a personal matter. The public gets to roast you as much as they want about this.
At this point,  anyone who makes it a point to be openly anti-gay, I just assume is beard-deep in dicks. Sorry, Lil' Jon...all them 'no homo' references are actively working against you.

Just come out. We'll all love you for it.

Blowback edit: I didn't mean to put homophobia at the feet of self-loathing, hypocritical politicians,  evangelicals,  and rapper. While it is a semi-common phenomenon,  I understand that most homophobia comes from ignorant heterosexuals. I apologize for the unintended insensitivity. I've still got shit to learn too, and sometimes I need to forego the smartassery and think about the words I use. 

That said, hopefully this guy can make a change, face his reality,  switch gears,  and start supporting gay rights. I'll hold my breath (tell my family I love them)
These stories write themselves
I heard it's only gay if there are 26 men in the orgy. He's good.
Conservatism is rooted in self-hatred.

Ah, good ol’ Dirty Mike and the boys having a soup kitchen.
Glad Lindsey Graham got out ok
As a Hungarian, I am totally ashamed of what our government does. What they advocate in the country is ridiculous (forcing christianity insanely so as anti-lmbtq) and whatever they do their reason is either “George Soros” or “Brussels” or “Migrants”. Such a shameful country with even more sad acts. Now clearly several times the government (Fidesz) was busted with scandals such as one of a Hungarian city’s major got caught having an orgy with a bunch of cocaine and hookers on a yacht which was presumably bought and maintained by the taxpayers money or the pedophile case which was conducted by another diplomat related to the government and now this idiot...
Trump Impeached for Abuse of Power

congrats to the guy who posted this. He's going to end up receiving a life time of reddit premium
John Dean (Nixon's lawyer) suggests that the House can impeach and not send it directly to the Senate. They can just sit on it, continuing to add to the investigation, and let it hang over Trump's head until after the election. If he gets re-elected, it can go to the Senate at that point, by which the Senate may look different. Interesting strategy.
Regardless of the outcome of this trial, there is no cause for anyone from any party to celebrate. Look at these fucking results:

100% of voting Republicans voted no on both articles. 99% of Democrats voted yes on both articles. Only one independent representative *existed*.

By contrast, the nay [votes on Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) were split 50/50. And 15 out of 100 votes across the [Republican vote on Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) were nay.

There is a clear adherence to party lines rather than public opinion or observation of the evidence. We could have just skipped the entire proceedings and gone straight to the vote. Why should we be okay with this?
Rep. Loudermilk actually compared Trump’s trial to Jesus’ crucifixion. Thats just ridiculous, I mean please
[deleted]
Even if it's symbolic and might not change anything, at least it's on record.
Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.

Impeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power & obstruction of congress.

Removal of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.

In other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.

EDIT: Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vsafairfight), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote.

I keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)

UPDATE: vote on impeachment for Obstruction of Congress has also passed.
Friendly reminder to vote in the next election and in every election.
I have lived long enough to see 2 presidents impeached, that's more than half of all presidential impeachments!!  One D and one R, too.

Edit: and one almost impeached.  Wonder what my end score will be!

Can someone ELI5 what happens now and what it means that he's impeached? I know the basic gist but I'm sure there's more to understand.
“I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” --- Donald J. Trump, 45th president of the United States (Impeached by the House of Representatives 12/18/19)
It's too bad that 2 prominent Republicans have already said that they refuse to be impartial during the Senate trial, and the "most transparent President ever" will not testify.
This *should not* be a partisan issue
I'm picturing professor Farnsworth saying "Good news everyone. Mr trump has been impeached, and this means absolutely nothing!"

https://youtu.be/YRCzEqkCoiM?t=1m27s
I really wish I could be excited about this but I can’t shake the fact that the senate will acquit him and he and his supporters will go on saying he’s “fully exonerated”.
First Republican impeachment— Trump loves his records
Just a reminder to everyone, unfortunately this doesn't mean he's not president anymore
And it still feels like any other day.
After Trumps impeachment, what are the odds he is reelected? Is that possible?
Mark your calendars for Nov 3, 2020 and don't forget to VOTE.

#TRUMP DOUBLE IMPEACHED

I wish the Senate would move on him like a bitch.
Why the fuck did OP get 230+ awards simply for posting a link to a news article?

Edit: thank you to whomever gilded me, you are a jedi master of trolling/humor for sure lol.
I like Presidents who weren’t Impeached.
Please contact your senators this week and please vote in 2020.
Trumps latest "They're not after me, they're after you - im just in the way." Tweet meme is a bit of a scary angle to come from.

Given how Trump has span so many things to his agenda, the thought of him spindoctoring it so its the public who feel threatened lays the groundwork for pretty terrifying things.
i’m gonna tell my kids that a user named macho nacho taco informed me that the president was impeached
Should have been impeached for witness intimidation and obstruction of justice. Two terrifying things you never want to see a president doing.
And now we can lay to rest *#ImpeachTrump* and move on to *#ConvictTrump*.
Deep down you know that someone gave Donald Trump a timeout and took his phone away so he wouldn’t say some crazy shit on Twitter.
The number of Americans who didn't pay attention in high school regarding the process of impeachment is astounding.
I know a guy who's a HUGE trump supporter and I can’t wait to ask him about this when I see him tomorrow in my local Benihana’s bathroom! I bet he’s so pissed!
r/agedlikemilk
So to get this right and understand correctly; we have a criminal who has literally confessed to the crime for which he is being investigated, for which we not only have their admission, but we have him literally on camera repeating one of the crimes and who went ahead and added China in on request with Ukraine to investigate his political rival on fucking live TV.  His personal lawyer also confessing to the crime, showing that he has evidence on multiple devices.  Hell, Rudy is still actively flying to and from Ukraine and is still pursuing this dirt and ongoing with this crime.  We have multiple witness testimony, plus more that have been instructed not to cooperate by the WH in what is quite obvious and deliberate obstruction of justice to add to the fact that Trump actually tweeted out witness intimidation that was called out in real time during the hearing of witness testimony...

And yet, somehow we still have all Republicans voting only along party lines and 30% of the country fucking eating it up?

This is un-fucking-believable.  There is no excuse for anybody still claiming to be a Republican.  Fuck these pieces of shit.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
Just here for history.
Hey, at least he won the popular vote this time!
Vladimir Putin's black belt revoked by international taekwondo organization

Thats one Horcrux down
I also heard that the horse he rides in shirtless photo-ops has publicly condemned him.
Now he doesn't know how to fight! Ah! Fucking scrub
The sanctions are getting fucking brutal
“Putin’s mom removes child drawings from home refrigerator magnets, kindergarten diploma revoked”
That’s the funniest sanction I’ve ever seen
Oh god what if this is what breaks the camels back
This is turning into a competition on who can fuck over Putin the best.... I am personally ok with all of it.
I fully support moves that are this level of petty
And his mom isn’t taking him to KFC on the way home either!!
I hope the sanctions somehow get pettier than this 🤣
Finally a sanction he might actually care about.
His black belt was honorary (but one of the highest possible degrees, 9th Dan). It is a common practice to give honorary black belts, with the degree varying, depending on the giving organisation and the person it is awarded to (see Zlatan Ibrahimovic). The common practice is, if the awarding organization is a local federation, to award a 4th or 5th degree Black Belt. The 9th Dan was probably given to him by the World federation (in this case the International Taekwondo Federation, since they are different things).

Source: my nickname
Lol trump outranks Putin in taekwondo
The ultimate dishonor.
I love every organization delivering a fuck you in whatever way they personally can.
I can't stop laughing at this one.
This is somehow even funnier than the meme about Olive Garden revoking Sean Hannity's pasta pass after the Jan. 6th insurrection.
Breaking news:

The book of the month club has decided to remove Putin's recommended book list from their website citing "We just don't like his whole vibe anymore"
Oh damn, you know things are rough when your black belt is getting sanctioned. 👀
I heard that Cafe Nero refused to give him his 6th coffee for free
You know you fucked up when they start taking away your trophies.
This is great news -- not only because it will really, really piss off Putin, but also because it reaffirms that Tae Kwon Do is about *honorable* fighting. Putin loves to think of himself as some great warrior, but the certifying body, with history behind it, just said, "Not so fast, faker."
send him a blue/yellow belt instead

So now he can't fight anymore?
Now he’s going to have to spend his Tuesday nights at the local community centre, redoing his taekwondo courses from scratch with a group of 7 year old boys
AHAHAHAHA, this is SO MUCH BETTER than them removing his as "honorary president".

He loved to present himself as a "big scary black belt".

I was raised VERY religious. No swearing at all. Really got baked into my speech patterns, even after I stopped caring about it.

I'm SO glad I was able to save up 40 years of clean language so that when I finally needed to say, "Fuck you, Putin!" I could REALLY mean it.

Fuck you with a splintered hickory rake sideways, Putin.
Ouch! Emotional Damage!!!!
Lol he must give back all the techniques he remembers
Oh man, that's funny as hell. And I'm all for it.
By end of the day, Putin will threaten to nuke the international taekwondo organization.
Soon the Russians are going to revoke his life.
Hit him where it hurts, below the belt-less
Never seen a whole ass country cancelled.
to be fair, in most cases yes taking away a black belt wouldn't take away a persons skills, but I am pretty certain his black belt was absolutely a title bestowed on him, not earned, so taking it away actually does make sense and is just hilarious to think of him sitting in his little desk pouting that he isn't a black belt anymore.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putins-black-belt-revoked-international-taekwondo-organization-1683304) reduced by 70%. (I'm a bot)

his black belt sounds even less legitimate than Dwight Schrute’s black belt.

The International Equestrian Association will also revoke his topless horse riding license.
I heard they’re revoking his library card next.
I can't help but imagine his black belt being in some shrine like display case in his office, and suddenly it mysteriously becomes lighter and lighter until eventually it becomes completely white.
that's it, that's the last straw
What's next, reject his application to an art school?
Lmao this is so petty and I love it. Ironically, I think Putin would actually care about this.

Also it reminds me of this scene from Harry Potter: “But Dumbledore says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,” said Bill, grinning.
Pretty soon they're gonna start taking away his goals from all those bullshit hockey games
Russian warship: fuck you and your unaccredited dojo.
These sanctions are getting pretty harsh. One might even say this one was… below the belt!
We're down to spiteful, petty, personal insults aimed directly at Putin now, and I for one wholeheartedly support this. 

I hope this stings.
One step closer to world peace
Biden was right, this guy is now a pariah.
Forget about economic sanctions. As an undersized, deeply insecure dude who nonetheless prides himself as a "man's man," this is hitting Putin where it hurts.
Now how will he keep his pants up?

Better be Putin on some suspenders.
May he forever stumble on his knee high pants
Oof.
That’s it. The war is over. We’ve done it friends.
The sanction that broke the camel's back
Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election

I just don't get it. How do people think Trump is looking to help the little guy, aka us citizens? He wants to run the country like a business. He is basically only looking out for his wallet and his own ass.

He has praised dictators and put Putin on a pedestal above all else.

He has unethically benefited from a business standpoint by having the government spend millions at his hotels. 

He has refused to demonstrate sympathy when a tragic shooting occurs.

He has mocked gold star families.

He goes on tirades on Twitter.

He fabricates "facts" (like the ones related to the Queen) to make himself seem better.

He had a scandal with a porn star.

He has literally been caught saying grab em by the pussy (and said some incestuous stuff about his daughter).

He constantly attacks the Constitution of Free Speech by calling various journalism "Fake News". 

He has ruined our relationships with previous allies.

He tried to start a trade war.

His tax cuts only helped large corporations and he defended the cuts by saying the employees would benefit when in reality the tax cuts stimulated buybacks of stock.

For the love of God I don't understand how people don't understand that he is not on par with all of the proper presidents we have had in the past. Trump is a stain on the legacy of presidents we have. If he has been capable of all this why do people think it's not possible that he is colluding with Russia or at the very least that he is obstructing Mueller from his investigation? 
>In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow’s cyberskills were so good that the government’s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.

If anyone thinks for a second that Putin, with complete confidence that he wouldn't get caught, wouldn't penetrate America's cyber defenses then they need to seriously examine their logic.
Man all this stuff is going to be amazing in future history classes.
The most gold stars ive seen
I want off Uncle Sam's wild ride
I remember my first job, I got fired for being late *once*. I pushed shopping carts.
"Wait, that's the same Vladimir V. Putin that we saw the other day? Aw guys, *you gotta tell me these things!*"


I think it needs reminding that John Locke, of whom the founding fathers were very well aware of when constructing the Constitution, stated in the Second Treatise of Government that those elected MUST be elected by those being governed. If a government is found to have been swayed by an outside influence, which meant that it was NOT duly elected by those abiding by the social contract by renewing that contract, then that government should be dissolved.  Locke advocated that it is an essential right, of the people and by the people, to revolt when the government failed in its duties to protect its citizens, their property, and their rights.

From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered

By David E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg

WASHINGTON — Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.

The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.

Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.

The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.

On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.

On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?” Mr. Trump shot back, “No” — directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)

Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, “because he’s in charge of the country.”

In the run-up to this week’s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.

The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.

The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the “Steele dossier.” That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump’s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.

According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin’s role in the election interference.

They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.

And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin’s own role.

That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.

Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.

Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.

The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called “hand-to-hand combat” to dig in.

The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.

After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said “Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries” were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations — including the D.N.C.

Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.”

Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.

“I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,” he said in testimony in May 2017. “And they were very aggressive.”

For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.

Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the election.

Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia’s election interference.

Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)

And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.

Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were “blinking red” and called Russia the “most aggressive foreign actor, no question.”

“And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,” he said.

Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.

“The intelligence community’s assessment has not changed,” Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. “My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.”

The Russian efforts are “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,” he continued. “We haven’t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.”

“It’s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.”

Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia’s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.

He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a “witch hunt” against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia’s role — and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump’s immediate orbit may have worked with them.

In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow’s cyberskills were so good that the government’s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.

Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure — as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday — he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.

That is what happened again this week, twice.

Mr. Trump’s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.

That contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered — although he also veered off script to declare: “Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.”


Okay, but **what do we do?**
Trump is the President, he's had access to all the top secret information and proof of what Russia has done this whole time. This is what makes his denials truly concerning.
This seems to be a national emergency.
Well if this isn't the end of his presidency then i'm afraid there is no end. 
*After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said “Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries” were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations — including the D.N.C.*

*Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.”*   

He's been trying to tamp it down ever since either because he thinks it taints his election victory or because he doesn't want to condemn Russia for unknown reasons.
It still baffles me this is real life. 
It’s so disappointing that we’ve become so desensitized, if this were any other president this would be such a massive deal but instead it’s likely just another headline. VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION, INCLUDING MIDTERMS. 
There is a serious chance that some of our spies have been killed because of Trump. We would never know until 70 years from now when it's all declassified.
> The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.

Trump is currently engaging in an ongoing criminal conspiracy, and he has been for years.
Does anyone else feel like this last week has been building up to something?

The longer this congress goes without taking action, the closer we get to losing the republic. 

No one will ever believe election results in the future unless things change immediately. 

If we can’t protect our elections, this country is doomed. 
 There should be an investigation to see if anyone in the Trump administration has any ties to America. 
At this point, it's just a question of the specific details of how everything exactly played out and to what extent republicans outside of the Trump campaign are complicit. The current public knowledge is already more than damning enough to conclude that there was communication and coordination with Russians and a deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into it.
Fox News: now here’s how this was Obama’s fault
The craziest thing is that his supporters (and that isn’t just confined to T_D)  are willfully supporting Russian interference in the name of winning. 

I can’t think of another president in the history of our country that could’ve gotten away with purposefully muddying the waters on such a critical issue involving a national enemy. Any other president would be facing crimes right now. But he isn’t because his party is beholden to his supporters, who will not disavow this man no matter what comes out. 

This is where our country is. A very large portion of the US just doesn’t give a shit. Call it a cult of popularity. Call it lack of education. Call it whatever, but fuck man this is embarrassing. 
Remember to vote November 6th www.vote.org has all your voting needs.
This seems like kind of a big deal.

Upvote this shit to the top so everyone knows how the President of the United States has been lying to the American people for going on 2 years now, over and over again. He needs to be impeached immediately for obstruction of justice.
Every time I refresh Reddit since Friday it seems there’s a highly gilded, highly upvoted new article about this Russia stuff really hitting the fan. I’ve been traveling and recovering from sickness, so I’m really behind... but I get the sinking feeling that this is all just the same old echo chamber of reasonable Americans who want Trump out. 

It really seems to be ramping up, but is this really *the thing?* Is this a tipping point? I desperately want to believe it is. I followed this investigation meticulously for a year and a half, but the last 3-4 months I’m just so exhausted. I feel like nothing is ever going to change.

Is this any different than all the times before? 

(Sorry, I feel like everyone asks this question every day but if someone can ELI5 about what is actually going on I’d be so appreciative.)
Worst president ever.
Bosnian Australian dude here.

I'm genuinely worried about you guys. A lot of us are freaking out too but we're rooting for team USA. 

America was already great before Trump's campaign but the whole world is watching this thinking about Trump when in reality it's far more than that. Your country's sovereignty is at risk, people are losing faith in the democratic process and whole swarms of people have essentially been brainwashed, even the president. I mean, Bill got his dick sucked and was impeached. Trump hasn't taken Putin's out of his mouth and he's still hanging around?

It's like WW3 started in a dark room full of computers in Russia and nobody noticed America was losing till not even now. 
Unless the people who are supposed to be checking this bullshit start doing it, I'm going to consider myself living in a lawless country.
I've been feeling kind of numb, but holy shit. It's hard to put into words, I'm tired of all this bullshit. It's hard enough to deal with life, let alone trying to keep track of the shit storm that has been the last two years. What the fuck can I say? Words seem to have lost their meaning in this shit show.
I'm a young blue collar kind of guy with the understanding that my opinion doesn't hold a tremendous amount of weight in the political arena but our government is supposed to compensate for that by giving my vote a credible voice so to speak. When my voice is taken away by a foreign government and I'm being told hush by my own government and called a liar, what the fuck kind of future can I hope for my kids?
Do something about it America 
> Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes.

[Holy shit NYT.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcSIy6NVIAAw-mo.jpg)
It is crucial that in the following months leading up to November that at no point do people sway from the focus, which is that *every single member of congress* who fails to remove this traitor from power is, themselves, **a traitor to the United States of America.**

That language is paramount. Ads, signs, you name it: **TRAITOR**. 

Supporting this spineless un-American piece of shit should come with it a brand of traitor that will never wash away because nobody who supports him truly supports America. 

And if you're sitting there reading this and thinking "but I still support him, and I support America", no. You don't. You, too, are a traitor and you are a walking disgrace of an American. 
Thing is, as much as this is a problem with how rotten Trump is, it’s also a problem with congress and the Republican Party just shrugging their shoulders with every lie and mistake he makes, siding with him no matter what. How many times it’s been clear Trump is unfit to run a lemonade stand let alone a country, yet nothing is done.

It’s 100% clear where the priorities of this party are, how they will blatantly put money, power and party well before the well being and future of the country or its citizens.

We’re talking about a president that lies on a daily basis, ignores basic intelligence, contradicts himself, has the need to feed and validate his huge ego, alienates and infuriates his closest allies, and lacks some of the basic intelligence you’d need to get a hight school degree.

How an entire party, government and part of a country can ignore so much incompetence and keep siding with him, believe every word that comes out of his mouth isn’t just baffling to America, but the world.

When does this end? What will it take for congress and republicans to realize that this man is not fit to be president? They’re all living in a little bubble where they can say and do anything they want without consequences. Well somehow this bubble needs to pop, or else I fear for the future of not just the states, but the world. 
I don't understand. If the CIA was there when he was shown this evidence, why haven't they spoken up?
Unfortunately, he was unable to read it.
wtf has this dude created the witch hunt himself just to have total chaos?
If Trump is impeached for collusion/treason, I want him to still have a presidential portrait. Only, it should show him turning his back towards the viewer, face hidden.

This illiterate ragamuffin needs to be tossed in prison for treason.
Never forget the men who were scooped up by the Russian government and charged with treason shortly after trumps inauguration.  There were 3 of them abruptly arrested the same day iirc.  There is no doubt in my mind trump or kushner provided the names as soon as they had access to them.

Far worse than one traitor, is an entire group that used him and stayed silent.

100k upvotes in 4 hours. impressive
This whole time he is been trying to act like russia didn’t do it and he fucking well knew we had prof Putin ordered the attack on fucking our elections.. how are republicans not impeaching this fucking asshole?
I see all of these articles of people, including some of our congressmen, actually disapproving of Trump's treason. The question that I always want to *scream* at the top of my lungs to them is:

#WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO ABOUT IT!? 
Hell Trump supporters will support him no matter what he does. 
The more I learn about this the more infuriated I feel about our government. What a colossal failure by our government to prevent and mitigate this whole situation.

It’s like watching someone run across the room to slap you and not do anything to stop it.
So it's Tre45on then?
So I guess we’re just not gonna do anything about this either? 
Queen Elizabeth II has died, Buckingham Palace announces

Taking pleasure in another person's death is a violation of our rules.
It’ll be weird hearing James Bond say “For King and Country” now
I really expected her to outlive charles by 5 minutes out of pure spite.
The guy on ITV constantly saying "his majesty the queen". I expect Charles will be getting many a few rounds of "God save the queen" before we all adjust
Queen's first PM was Churchill, who was born 1874

Queen's last PM, Truss, born 1975
She won’t even get to send herself a letter congratulating herself on reaching 100 years old
It’s insane to think that Queen Elizabeth’s first PM was Winston Churchill. The amount of history she has seen is simply incredible to believe. I know it’s cheap to say that we won’t see anyone like this again in our lifetime, but truly it is incredible to realise.

As a Brit, this is a very weird time in our national consciousness. My commuter train went totally silent in the space of about a minute as people picked up the news. Nobody seems quite certain how to react.
It is so weird hearing the BBC reporters talking about the king and queen consort. It's so odd hearing the word king in reference to england
look up a gallery of photos with her standing next to all the US presidents chronologically (either ascending or descending, both are great), it's truly staggering.

she was the queen for more than a quarter of US-american history.
My favourite clip of the queen [was this when she got excited seeing cows](https://youtu.be/jXGeft7khSo)
My Grandmother (still alive and healthy) is about 7 days younger than the Queen. Whenever someone in the commonwealth lives to be 100, the Queen would write a letter to them personally. I was really hoping to read that letter when they both reached 100, as they are so close in age.

I know my Grandma will make it there. Hopefully Charles will write it any way, and hopefully I'll get to read it!

Winston Churchill on the passing of King George.
The end of an era.
Feels unreal. Was beginning to think she was going to live forever.
Isn’t it wild, you think about how radical it was that her coronation was televised…..and her death announced via Twitter.
Here's a fantastic TIL that I'll just squeeze into this thread:

> **Will he be King Charles III?**  
> Not necessarily. His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George, so he could select any of those as his regnal title. This means that Britain’s next monarch might not go by the name of Charles, or he could decide he wants to be referred to as King Philip or **King Arthur**.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-succession-britain-royal-family/

I hope his first action is to decree that Buckingham Palace henceforth shall be named Camelot.
And just like that, most of us will never see a Queen of the United Kingdom again.
King of Britain has a bizarre sound to it
[removed]
Ever since I saw her passing hot dogs at the Dodgers game on one of her official visits to the US, I realized how she was a down to earth queen. RIP Elizabeth.
Per the existing line of succession, it's unlikely there will be another Queen for a very long time.
For those of us in commonwealth countries, this is a huge end of an era.

My parents, who are nearing 70, only know her as the monarch. 

While the royal impact isn’t really felt around the commonwealth much, it’s still huge news.

Definitely a good, long life and most of her family were able to be there with her - I imagine that’s what most of us can hope for.
Operation Unicorn now goes into effect. Rest in Peace Queen Elizabeth II.

Once the death has been made public, Holyrood Palace, St Giles' Cathedral, and the Scottish Parliament will serve as the focal point of  gatherings, with a condolence book open to the public set up at the  latter location. Parliamentary business will be suspended immediately for at least six parliamentary days, in order to allow authorities to  prepare for the funeral.

The parliament will then prepare a motion of condolence within 72 hours of reconvening. The Queen's coffin will first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace, followed by a service of reception at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to Waverley station and then taken by the Royal Train to London if possible.

Otherwise, the coffin would be taken by plane to London and welcomed by the prime minister and cabinet ministers.

There have been and are still are many monarchs, but I suspect Elizabeth II will be "The Queen" for ages to come, the world over.
I am sitting in hospice, by my own grandmother’s deathbed. Grandma was born in 1928, and has known the Queen her entire life, through Depressions and Wars. At 94, she can hardly hear or talk. 

I told her “Grandma, you outlived the Queen!” And she smiled.  

It’s been hard for her to accept death, but maybe now that the Queen, her Queen, is on the other side, Grandma is ready too. I’ll stay here until she’s ready too.
 
 
 
Edit:  I held her hand as she passed in her sleep.  Thank you for your kind messages and for sharing your own stories of your elders.
As my dad likes to say at times like this; it may not have been a surprise, but it is still a shock.  
  
Rest in peace Queen Elizabeth II, and thank you for your long and dedicated service.
She reigned for 30% of the existence of the United states. 

Mental.
As a Brit I'm finding myself more upset than I expected, I'm not a royalist but she was such a symbol of our country and felt like a permanent fixture. It feels like an old family friend has passed away. Rest in peace.
The only monarch of the UK about 94% of the world has ever known. May she rest in peace.

Edited to change percentage from 85->94% as per comments below.
"Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Liz Truss, born 101 years later in 1975, and appointed by the Queen earlier this week.". 
  
Wow. What an era she lived. May she rest in peace.
As a Brit that has always been pretty indifferent to the monarchy, this is a weird feeling...

I rationally don't really care about the monarchy, but this  has made me feel sad?

Odd feeling.
The end of an era, wow. RIP Queen Elizabeth.
I met Queen Elizabeth once, briefly. Her Majesty liked to drive her car and sneak around without anyone significantly noticing. 

I have by chance encountered a few heads of state. But out of all of them, the one who seemed more like a regular person, who could pass off as someone's grandma or neighbor, out for a stroll, and could blend in better than most was her Majesty. 

I have been told I was not the only person who encountered her by chance while she was on one of her low-key retreats. But that knowledge always made her seem more human and I respected that fact. It is my opinion, that many heads of state let their title consume them, and the fact that she didn't, I found something humbling and admiring about that fact.
Crazy to think at 27 she got the news that her dad passed and she was queen, the next person to get news  of being King is 74.
She became queen when computers were barely a thing and now her death is the subject of attention on mass social media. Really puts her reign's length in perspective.
The Queen lasted a whole 2 days with Liz Truss as PM.
This is the end of an era. As an American, it's a little weird seeing how beloved she was, even here.
I hope the corgis will be taken care of.
Well, I think Keith Richards is the last one who will outlive us all.
Love her or hate her. This is world news at its peak, potentially the most famous person in the world.
I will never forget how she had the royal orchestra play the American national anthem during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace on Sept 13, 2001. God save the queen my English friends.
Her stint lasted approximately 2,334 Scaramucci’s. God bless the Queen.
So many families have had generations live and die with her as Queen. This will be a huge change.
The final world leader to serve in WW2. RIP, Queen Elizabeth.
Anyone younger than 70 will have known no other monarch than the queen. Absolutely crazy times. The 'King of England' will take a LONG time to get used to hearing
What a woman. She survived a world war after which she was coronated. She oversaw the dismantling of an empire, the Cold War, an unprecedented social and technological revolution, joining the EU, Brexit, 9/11 and the hell that followed, a pandemic that shook the world, but couldn’t face a Britain headed by Liz Truss… surprised she didn’t take the Ravens with her…

Levity aside, she was one of the only leaders of modern times that I had any respect for. Someone who continually put the job first, and worked 30 years past the point most would have retired. Love or loathe the institution, the woman commands respect. 

R.I.P. Your Majesty.
Sadly, this was almost inevitable following the earlier annoucement at lunchtime. I don't think the enormity of this will sink in for some time.

For most of us alive, the Queen is all we have ever known. The concept of another monarch on the throne is an entirely alien concept. This truly will be a new era and just to think of everything that will have to change including bank notes, coins, post boxes etc.

70 years on the throne is unprecedented and despite so much change and upheavel throughout these years, The Queen has remained constant and carried out her duites professionally.

This country has changed so much in the last 70 years. As we move into uncharted terrorities it remains to be seen what the future holds. Let's hope the country comes together and remains strong in times of political and financial instability both at home and globally.

RIP Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (1926-2022)
As an American who had the privilege of living in London during her reign, my deepest condolences to the people of England. Never had I seen a world leader who was more widely respected and admired by her people, regardless of politics. Rest In Peace, and God save the King.
Liz Truss once said we should get rid of the Queen.

Liz Truss met the queen two days ago.

The Queen is now dead.

Coincidence?
Condolences from your cousins across the ocean. When the national anthem was played at Buckingham palace after 11 Sep 01 I always attributed that to her (probably a bad assumption) such a class act, like Queen Elizabeth.
My grandmother was a British citizen. Queen Elizabeth II had been her queen since she was 7 years old, and she loved her. Even though my grandmother passed over a decade ago, this death still feels weirdly personal and sad.
I think it's under appreciated how well she conducted herself for basically her entire lifetime.

As others have said, she devoted her entire life to her duties and carried them out impeccably.

Words have been said about the monarchy, but this is about the Queen who conducted herself with grace, dignity and dedication'.
RIP to the only queen many of us have ever known. It's going to be weird seeing a new face on our money here in Canada.
The Constant is changing
The key to immortality is to live a life worth remembering.  Rest In Peace Queen Elizabeth.
London bridge has fallen. Damn never thought I'd be alive to see it.
My lad is in a rage. He's been saving money and now he thinks he can't use it. I'm giving it 5 more mins and I'll break the news its fine...lol

QE2 would approve. What an ambassador for the UK she was, so much respect for her. Keep calm, carry on.
I left the UK today after a 10-day visit to England and Wales. I am Canadian, thus a Royal subject. Have grown up with the Queen. Never spent much time in England, or really cared to - too close to home. Always more exotic and interesting places to explore. I had the best time in the UK and realize I’ve always undervalued it. To hear this news now just as I’ve left is very sad. She was a great lady.
[deleted]
Seeing inventions to wars to technological advancements to the moon and the Internet all from a throne. What a span.
The thing that I find comforting is that she died surrounded by loved ones, and her head held high in a lifetime of devotion to her country.
It feels especially shocking for this nation as we enter further into ever more uncertain times with the economy in the shit, climate change now becoming a massive concern and the most horrendous government in recent memory that one bastion of integrity and decency has left us. It’s almost a painfully symbolic moment for this country right now.
To anyone not understanding the gravity of this news, here in the UK every TV channel is either showing the news, stopped broadcasting or has an announcement on the bottom of the screen telling you to switch to a news channel. This is 9/11 level coverage. All the radio stations are playing sombre, low key music and there is no one outside. Everyone is watching the news. Few people alive have seen this before and it really feels like the end of an era.
That onetime when she visited Saudi Arabia and drove the king, back when women weren't allowed to drive. She was a badass.
More than 150 senior Russian officials sign open letter condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine as 'an unprecedented atrocity' and warn of 'catastrophic consequences' while urging citizens 'not to participate'

I hope Russia loses and Russians wins
My biggest wish is that this invasion backfires spectaculary and leads to Putin's downfall, not that I'm stupid enough to think it'll actually happen though
These people are our biggest hope right now. To be more precise, a unified large-scale opposition in Russia would be the only proper way for this madness to stop, so let’s hope the Russian people see through Putin‘s bullshit nationalist agenda.
Relevant part:

>More than 145 Russian municipal officials have signed an open letter condemning Vladimir Putin's 'personal' invasion of Ukraine, describing it as 'an unprecedented atrocity for which there is no and cannot be justification'

*Municipal* officials. 150 out of, I imagine, a lot more.
I can’t keep silent, but I don’t know English well and I write through Google translator. I am from Russia, but I have Ukrainian roots. I am terrified. Russia has long been in the ass, everything is becoming more expensive. Now it will get even worse. People think about their survival and do not want to become cannon fodder. Rallies are not coordinated, those who go to rallies are imprisoned. The security forces are on Putin's side. If earlier I went to a rally, then later, after the birth of a child, I will not go. If they put me in jail, who will take care of him? Matvienko calls those who are against the war terrorists. Now this is their favorite article, Navalny and his associates have already been branded terrorists.

 U. P. D. 
sorry, Matvienko called not terrorists, but those who think only about their own needs. For some reason, there were terrorists in my head.
All the gulag jokes aside, this is what we need right now. Russians who will be heard, taking a stance against Putin. Putins propaganda needs to be stopped and interfered.
It is nice to see at least some open dissent within Russia over this abhorrent war that Putin has started. My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions. Ultimately, I will not be upset if Putin is found hanging from a streetlight by the end of this war.
These guys have balls, willing to risk their lives to stand up to one of the cruelest leaders in the world.
Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

•	⁠in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua
•	⁠in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en
This is what we need from all the Russians who do not support war.
Putin has not done a great job selling this to the Russian people. Lots can't see the gains.
One thing I'll say: I think the United States is coming off looking really honest and transparent in all of this. Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign. But now that it's playing out \*exactly as the US said it would,\* it seriously undermines Putin's frequent talking point that the US is lying. 

I don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. 

There's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.
These people are BRAVE.  Thank you for doing what is right!
It's weird and depressing being at work like it's just another day here in nowhere Missouri, USA. Knowing damn well this shit is happening over there. I'm just waiting for 4:00 so I can go hangout with my 7 year old son. Somebody over there just lost their kid. I'm trying not to cry at work today and it's difficult. I'm sorry people suck!!
Anyone else wonder what other “once in a lifetime” world event am I gonna live through or see today…at this rate I’m sure by lunchtime some crazy will go down
The 150 officials willing to be remembered as hero’s instead of traitors and evil people under a mad man. I respect that decision even if they are corrupt individuals but standing up to a mad man takes balls.
I really wish for Putin to share the same fate as Saddam Hussain one day. I hope he hangs one day
This takes an incredible amount of courage, and standing against a tyrant is what true patriotism looks like.
[deleted]
Is it 150 "senior Russian officials" as the headline says or 150 municipal deputies from cities within Russia as the body of the article suggests?  They seem to be 2 very different things.  Nobody would call the treasurer of baton rouge a "senior American official"
The world needs to see more of this news right now. There is hope, and taking an ethical stand in the face of certain death is the absolute hallmark of bravery.
This is what we need.   Rational Russians who realize Russia's best interest is in working with the rest of the world, not in following the foolish whims of a KGB agent nostalgic for some ideal Soviet fantasyland that never actually existed.
This is exactly what we need right now.
The propaganda is BAD in Russia. And a lot are buying into it. Here’s a message i got from a Russian friend of mine. “There is no correct information about events anywhere. I do not believe that Russia was the first to enter the border of Ukraine. Putin would not have made such a stupid decision. I'm sorry, of course, but it seems to me that the European Union and America are deliberately provoking Russia to such actions in order to eventually capture us”

How can you believe that after The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation announced that they will detain "participants of unauthorized actions in the regions" if they go to rallies against the war with Ukraine

Thank god not everybody is drinking the koolaid. Fuck Putin. And praise these officials standing up against him. Unfortunately a lot of Russians are gonna commit suicide with multiple bullets to the back.
I wonder if the KGB trolls who know about the outside world aren't doing a great job at bringing down the internet in Ukraine.....  being intentionally lazy at their job.

The future of Russia belongs to the 20 & 30 year old Russians...... not Adolf Putin.
I wonder if the sanctions targeting individual impacted any of these officials.
Imagine it will be a repeat of the aftermath of death of stalin
Finally people fighting the robot
The Daily Mail is not a credible source and what they're saying is too far from what we know or expect for that rag to be taken at its word.

Until it's corroborated by someone else, say an actual newspaper, we shouldn't believe this.
Weird how I don’t see any more “US is fear mongering” type articles. Wonder what happened to all of those.
So many shitty 'jokes' in the comments. Good on these officials for taking a principled stand and doing whats right at huge personal risk, I wish I knew I'd be do the same in their shoes. This is what real courage looks like.
I'm russian and a young woman, chronically ill too. I want to protest but the police brutality in my city is rampant. I could get beaten up and left handicapped for life, or kicked out of university, losing all the money my parents payed for my education. I signed two petitions and gave a little money (because i don't have much myself) to a ukranian charity. I want to help stop this senseless war, i don't want death and destruction for our ukranian brothers and sisters, but there's not much else i can do. What's worse is that i planned to move from russia after getting my degree, to anywhere really, even ukraine itself sounded nice. But now that people i never chose as my rulers are waging a war, i fear i may get stuck in a dangerous dictatorship for years. Honestly I'm terrified. And to all ukrainians currently in danger: i'm so sorry 💔 this shouldn't be happening
The risk that those officials are taking is very real. Their lives and the lives of their families are now on the line. That is what courage looks like. I hope their calls for peace are heard and I hope they survive the purge that Putin will inevitably take against them.
In other news, more than 150 senior Russians officials mysteriously died of old age.

Good for them going against someone like Putin.

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views.
Edit: I was wrong. Seems there was another open letter, also with 150 Russians signging it?

Previous open letter:
https://www.politico.eu/article/anti-war-russia-open-letter-to-president-vladimir-putin/

Open letter presumably daily mail is referring to:
https://7x7-journal.ru/news/2022/02/24/bolshe-100-deputatov-podpisali-pismo-protiv-vojny-s-ukrainoj
Is there a better source on this than the daily mail?
Open defiance if Putin is almost unheard of.  Putin has lost the plot.
I'm from Slovakia. I've read how Ukraine president called our president "Mrs President, they bombing us, soldiers and civilians died, can we count on you?" (in sense to keep the  borders open and provide material help etc) 

I'm almost 30y old man, and I had tears in my eyes. Fu*k yeah! you're welcomed here. Any time, anyone. 

I'm sick of pretending that because Ukraine is not NATO we don't care. we do. I wish I could do more then these words.
I am really hoping this is the beginning of the end of Putin.

But I am probably just wishful thinking. 

He is almost a comical, cartoonish villain, except he is real and his atrocities and crimes against humanity are real.
[deleted]
He can't put away all 150 *senior* officials though. Right???
Rejecting US evacuation offer, Zelensky says I need anti-tank ammo, 'not a ride'

NATO is now reported seeking Ukranian membership.
“I need anti-tank ammo, not a ride.” And “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” Will go down in history
Russia's problem here is that if he dies, he's a martyr.  If he lives, he's a hero.  They've failed to make him look weak and surrender. They'll never be able to hold an occupation of more than a few eastern territories. They won't be able to install a puppet government who can control the populace.
This man is putting so many “world leaders” to shame. Freaking legend already.

I’m from Mexico and I’m 100% certain our actual president would never behave this bravely, even if he was younger. Pretty certain that many people around the globe are wondering the same about their heads of State.
The amount of supplies going into Ukraine from the Polish border is increasing by the hour. Family
Members stationed on Ukrainian border have alleged that large quantities of javelins, stingers, and MANPAD systems are flowing into Ukrainian held areas.

You are not alone Ukraine! Polands borders are open to Ukraine in BOTH ways. To provide refuge and send arms and ammunition, just like our neighbor Lithuania has promised.

Slava Ukraini!
That's a wartime one-liner right up there with Jean Danjou's "We have munitions. We will not surrender."
[What do I need?](https://c.tenor.com/eJEnnBN0-AYAAAAC/halo-master-chief.gif)

In all seriousness, Zelensky gets it.  If you're going to ask others to fight and die for your country, you have to be willing to put yourself in harms way just as much as they do.  Lead from the front, not the rear.

Looking at you, Pussy Putin.
I think he knows that even if he is killed, he will create a huge problem for Russia. He will be seen as a martyr and inspire resistance for years to come even if Russia succeeds. I think this makes Putin nervous. I think he calculated Zelensky would flee and Ukrainians would become deflated. Clearly the opposite is happening.
Zelensky is a real ride or die motherfucker.
Lawyer --> Comedian --> Actor --> President --> Extreme Badass
A fucking legend is being born before our eyes.
“Call the ambulance…but not for me”. 

This man is a true leader.
I love this guy. He better make it out alive.
I'm so moved by this man's dedication to his country and his people. What a fucking hero. I know it's unlikely, but please, please let him make it out of this alive.
This man is a fucking hero.
What an incredible show of leadership under the most serious of conditions. The world is watching and I hope will act. We need countries like Ukraine and leaders like Zelensky. Truly humbled by their courage.
Lol damn we need to start calling Russia East Ukraine at this point. The balls on this guy.
In 200 years history books will criticize Putin for his failures.

In 2000 years armies will quote Zelensky for his leadership and bravery in hell.

This is how you make a legacy.
This is not brave....this is something else.

Not many politicians would choose to stay and fight when a superior army is gaining towards their  position and they are the number 1 target of said army.

He was going to go down in history as the comedian who became a president. 

Now whether he makes it or not, he will go down as a president that looked death in the eye and did not flinch.
SEND HIM ALL THE JAVELINS! I want to see some Olympic caliber throws.
Isn't it kind of sad how a comedian makes a better politician than most of the people running the world right now?
Somebody please get this man some fucking anti tank ammo
Give this man everything.
This man knows something Putin will never know… what it means to be a man.  Respect!
As an American, Zelensky is more Bruce Willis than any man I've ever heard of.
Even just reading that line makes me want to run through a brick wall for him
Metal as fuck
He's in the streets, recording videos to let his people know he's right there with him. Can you imagine an American president doing that? My mind rejects even the image of that.
We need more guys like this in America
Goddamn. Juxtaposed against Putin’s whimpering about “no one being able to predict geopolitics” and that Russia was “forced to attack Ukraine” Putin couldn’t look like more of a little bitch.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t1lsn6/putin_nervously_addresses_oligarchs_about_the/

If nothing else, Zelensky is showing that Putin’s tough guy act was just that, an act. Zelensky is showing what real toughness is. 

Who would’ve fucking thought, the former KGB agent is a cowardly little bitch, and the former standup comedian has become the bravest world leader of the past 100 years.
I hope he has a message and plan of succession in case he gets clapped. But I think he knows what Ukrainians need, its Ukrainians, and he is striving to be a literal example. This is some JFK/Lincoln/Washington shit.
I'm surprised the Russians haven't found him yet.  It should be easy to spot his balls from a satelite.
If Putin is smart he'll let this guys live.

Guys like this are something else. They're elevated past the status of man. They become folk heros and symbols to rally behind. Legends can inspire generations of people to fight tooth and nail against impossible odds. 

And this guy? If he falls in the fighting after demonstrating valor like this, he'll be a fucking matyr. Alive he'll be dangerous to Putin, but dead? Dead he'll be an absolute spectre that haunts him for the rest of his days in Ukrainian territory, driving his still living countrymen to fight in his name. If this guy dies, they'll write songs about him.
Big swanging brass ones on this dude. Mad respect.
Everything that comes out about Zelensky makes me respect the man more and more. This IS a leader. Don't think Ukraine could've asked for a better president during this most trying of circumstances. Hell, it seems like their entire top brass is standing with the people from what I've seen (Prime Minister etc., even an ex-president) Really pulling for Ukraine through all this. Whether or not Zelensky himself makes it through this, the man will certainly go down as a legend in Ukrainian history. 

Slava Ukraini!
America is already preparing and coordinating arms drops. Ukraine is going to have so many fucking weapons before this is over.
As a Canadian with Ukranian ancestry I have doubts that many if any of our current mayor's or politicians would ever behave this admirably in the face of such brutality. I don't believe Zelensky is an outlier among his countrymen and women. He represents the bravery and hopes that all Ukranians deserve their sovereignty and freedom for their own destiny without little Hitler pulling the strings.
This goes beyond bravery....this fucking mythic. 

Putin is gonna fuck around and make a national martyr out of this man, and the puppet govt will NEVER root. 

FUCK PUTIN!
SLAVA UKRAINI!!
World leaders need to be like him. Be with your people, not against them. Fight with them, fight for them. Stand by their side and they will stand by yours. Im a nobody American watching the world unfold, rooting for Ukraine, hoping one day we have a strong, true, brave leader to step up to the plate. I know Zelensky must be terrified out of his mind, but to face that terror and protect your home and your people despite that is what a real human does.
Putin went into this war chasing some kind of vain glory and wound up putting the enemy leader on the path to lionization.
That is one fucking badass line lol
If this guy makes it out of this alive he will win every election in Ukraine for the rest of his life
Ukrainian leader too angry to die.
I don’t think people realize the amount of patriotism my people exhume. Since the 2014 bullshit, they’ve been fueled by anger by sadness, by betrayal from what suppose to have been our brother beside us. Nobody is going to leave, our military will not surrender to putins bullshit… it’s either we’re dying but surrendering is not an option. Fuck you again putin, and the people that support your bullshit war. 
 And a ps : fuck you Americans who support putin, and anyone in the world who does. You are the problem as well, you are sick or uneducated about the problems in the world but you choose to give your input anyway so fuck you too. 

Glory to ukraine, Slava ukraine
Liking Zelensky more and more. I didn’t realize Ukrainians were so brave.  Never under estimate the power of a willful native populace. Russia may be in trouble.

Get these people more anti tank ammo, now!
Everything that I've seen about Ukrainians since Russia invaded leads me to believe that every single one of them is FUCKING INSANE in the best way.
This guy is a certified badass. That’s someone you can follow.
Truly inspiring to see real leadership, the kinda stuff so badass that if you saw it in a Hollywood film you'd say it was unrealistic.

Mr Zelensky, the world has your admiration.
Another quote that will go down in history from one of the greatest leaders in history.
Get this man a shield.
Jesus fuck this guy is a legend.

If that was my president I would gladly ride to the depths of hell and back with him.
Exactly. Wtf. We said 'never again" about the Holocaust then we let people get slaughtered by asshats. We have weapons. We hate Hitler 2.0. We are supposedly pro freedom. 

Blow Putin to kingdom come already.
This man an inspiration and example to us all. The world is lead by a bunch of old, spineless and greedy bastards. Seeing someone willing to do right by its people is such a breath of fresh air. 

we should all take notes when it's time to choose our leaders worldwide. We need leaders like him everywhere who are willing to take our biggest problems head on.
Ukraine is modern day Sparta
It looks like Putin might have already lost long term, whatever the immediate outcome may be.

He might pull off a very ugly “win” by killing Zelensky and setting up a puppet government . But between this and Snake Island soldiers “go fuck yourself” Ukraine now have fresh stories for generations to come about resisting at all cost against Russia. I mean Staline did change the story partly through Russification of part of Ukraine but it took killing 3.9 millions  Ukrainian/relocating thousands of Russians.  Putin can’t go there : he doesn’t have the tools and it ain’t the 30’s anymore. He and Russia would be a full-blown pariah/North Korea like and he would have most likely massive revolts all over Russia judging by what already happened.  


Not sure if Zelensky will make out of this alive but he might have  defeated Putin right there. Even  if he dies, he dies a proper martyr for Ukraine independence. And Putin has a proper quagmire on his hands.
I will get this man tattooed on my arm if he pulls this off
Good luck and godspeed hero!
Don't die you brave bastard! Hang tough! Ukraine needs you.
If he makes it out of this alive, he is going to ride one hell of a reelection when his term is up
This is such a smooth psychological move on his part as well. Knowing Putin values masculinity to an obnoxious degree, Zelenksy puts himself right into the action where Putin is markedly absent. It may work to draw him out to where he can be dealt with or it may not but damn it takes the biggest balls in the world.
This man. Holy fuck. Please, *please* let Zelensky live to see a peaceful resolution to this conflict, as well as his family and as many Ukrainians as possible. They are doing nothing less than fighting tooth and nail for their lives and their home. This man is no politician. No, this is a true leader. He’s staying with his people in their darkest hour; not in some tent or bunker dozens of miles from the frontline, he’s sitting right in the heat of it. 

I’ve gained so much respect for this guy, despite not really having heard of him before a week ago.
Remember when Ted Cruz fled Texas to Cancun because it was cold and uncomfy????
This dude might very well be the most badass person in the known Universe
I honestly just hope that he sent his family out. I would understand his wife not wanting to leave him, and wanting to be an example herself, but they have kids. And thinking about Putin getting his hands on them to make a public example makes me sick to my stomach.
Zelensky is probably the Ghost of Kyiv at this point
While this man is kicking ass right now at leading his country in this crisis, western countries will be intent on not letting him be captured or die, being able to set up a Ukrainian government in exile is better than Russia getting their hands on him.
Send this guy all the TOW missiles at our disposal
Give him weapons.

And two transports.

One for the ammo, and another for his massive balls.
I’m from the Netherlands and my prime minister said that his “mate and good friend” is in danger and hopes he’ll make it through this. His “mate” being this brave man Zelensky. 

Instead of hoping, I wish my prime minister would pick up arms as well and do everything humanly possible to protect this legend and the rest of Ukraine from Putin… Instead they debate about whether or not they need to cut Russia from Swift because that would impact Europe’s economy. 

F*ck that, people are losing their lives, we are bigger then Putin and his oil and gas, so fight! 
Fight with Zelensky!
I am really put off by the sob sisters in the threads who believe too much assistance to Ukraine will result in nuclear war. If that is what you believe you might as well hand the world over to the Russians and Chinese now. Russian military commanders are as afraid of nuclear war as any sane person. Putin is a little man talking smack.
President Trump withheld 400 million in military aid to Ukraine when he was in office.
If every country had a leader like that we’d be in such a better place as a species
Not one fucking bone spur in sight.
Seriously give them tank Ammo. Give them air superiority to let them fight. Give them hope. Give them a chance.
“I need a Luger, not an Uber.”
Those sunflowers aren't gunna plant themselves.

Badass.
No dick energy in the modern era, possibly ever, has ever been as big as Zelensky’s. This man’s cock radiates like a galaxy of suns, burning bright and proud, coursing through the universe, shining through the darkness screaming “Putin is a bitch” with a voice so clear and so loud that some alien on some distant world is currently creating their people’s mythology around this wisdom of the gods.
Give this man NATO.
This guy is fucking amazing

I hope he makes it out alive
Lend-lease some A-10s.

Some BRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and side of AGM-65M's would go a long way.

Zelensky needs anti-tank? Wasn't this literally what the A-10 was designed to do?
This dude is quite the leader
Give this man some drone overwatch, with strike options, some anti tank air dropped javelins, tows, laws, at4's . Even the old deadstock shit "someone" and "mistakenly" drop into Ukrainian hands that "someone" **whoops** dropped/delivered to the wrong address (happens all the time according to ups/FedEx).

Those anti tank munitions that were plug and play were on their way to some other close country just in case fighting spilled over to their country and the aircraft took small arms fire and had to drop it's load to lose weight since they hit a fuel tank and they wouldn't have made it back.

We don't know where the munitions dropped, somewhere between here and there but by now someone got ahold of them.

I mean whoever that "someone" is that had to "mistakenly" drop the weapons due to reported small arms damage to the aircraft they were in. I've heard worse stories from big governments on other "mistakes" so this seems easy to pull off in the political bullshit forum for these guys.

Hopefully it doesn't happens again but who knows.. someone might leak flight plans and manifests for cargo and target those planes and they keep unfortunately getting shot and losing cargo around ukraining held areas so that cargo **whoops** is in Ukrainian military hands and **whoops** it's just what they needed but we promise it was planned to be delivered somewhere else but the trigger happy Russian armed forces on the ground keep shooting at our humanitarian aid aircraft so those supplies and stuff bound for someone else **whoops** got shot up and dropped in Ukrainian held points in country.

Bigger bullshit stories have floated before. Easy way for "someone" to help them without knowledge. 

What's that called.. you know the bullshit political folks hide behind?

Oh yeah, plausible deniability. 

We didn't know your shoot up our humanitarian aid planes bound for somewhere else and we didn't know those planes mistakenly had tons of anti tank system drones and etc. Your bad for shooting at our aircraft when we aren't a participant in the conflict.

Whoops.

Give em hell Ukraine.

How quickly do you think this would go into effect? I have to be in Tijuana for a dentist appointment tomorrow
Honestly every country that doesn't have infections should close borders. A month or two of isolation is better than a death toll.

>	US case count passes 2,000

That’s 2,000 tests that came back positive, not the total number of infected. 

A medical professor at Johns Hopkins University believes that number could be up to 500,000. 

Also, the number of people we’ve tested is minuscule, especially in comparison with other countries:

>	Between Jan. 18 and March 12, there were 13,624 tests for COVID-19 conducted in the U.S. Meanwhile, South Korea has conducted over 100,000 tests, and the U.K. has tested nearly 25,000 people. [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marty-makary-on-coronavirus-in-the-us-183558545.html)

Mexican here, this is bullshit 100%, international planes are still being allowed to enter the country and borders aint closing unless US orders it. Our president legit told on a public broadcast that COVID-19 "wasn't a problem".
We live in strange times
In all fairness Trump did say they would pay for the wall.
Baia baia.

Take a shot for every comment you read that says "oh how the tables have turned"
I'm pretty sure the situation is just as bad in Mexico but testing/awareness in Mexico is even worst than the US.
I'm in Mexico currently on vacation. Flight scheduled to go home early Sunday morning....
Mexico closing the border to the US???? News you never thought you’d read in 2020.
Friendly reminder that the Daily Mail is garbage. If what they're saying is true, it will be carried by a legitimate source, and they do not deserve clicks either way.
I feel like Mexico just wants to be the one saying, “we’re closing the Mexico/US border”
Mexico likely already has cases they just haven't detected it yet. That said, they should close the border.
They should build a wall to stop Americans from coming into Mexico
Let's be clear that this is 2,000 confirmed cases. They are hardly testing anyone
There goes my vacation to Cancun
Basically the comments are gonna be leftists relishing in what they perceive as sweet irony towards a group of people who don't actually mind this response from Mexico, and rightists satirising leftist outrage.
Man Mexico is such a racist country. How dare they want control over there borders
Go ahead. If Mexico is genuinely concerned, please close the border on trade and personal travel. You have a genuine interest in protecting your citizens. No one will blame you.

What a beautiful sight. Everyone from nearly every corner of the globe coming together to hate Russia and never let them live this down.

(Except for the Russian citizens standing against this and know it’s wrong. You guys are blessed too)
Just out of curiosity, how would one go about logging into any of the leaked email addresses??? Is this even allowed to be talked about? Sorry if not
What's this data include?  I saw the article, but I'm not following.
Look for Putin's nude and plaster it around Moscow!
You love to see it.
Find their bank accounts, drain them and send proceeds to Ukraine charities. Go, Anonymous!
Doesn’t look like passwords but rather encrypted/hashed passwords although some are in brackets in plain text.

But this part is interesting (although appears false):

Even Pornhub had its say by blocking Russian users and greeting them with the Ukrainian flag and a message of support.
Good. The Russain government doesn't deserve nice things right now.

It is a way of fighting, it is a way to strike back, it is a way of inflicting great distress and can be as Trump once said, "Done by a 400# man sitting in his mother basement".
“Many activists took Ukraine's calls on the hacker underground to defend against Russia to heart. Earlier today, Anonymous claimed responsibility for taking down Russia's most prominent websites used to spread Kremlin propaganda.  **Even Pornhub had its say by blocking Russian users and greeting them with the Ukrainian flag and a message of support.**”


Pornhub for the win ✨
Even Pornhub is blocking Russian users, and supporting Ukraine? I don’t know whether or not to laugh ngl. You know you’re doing something bad when even they block you.
I hope and think most people in the world hate Putin now. And i hope the power of a lot of them will stop the war.
This is the very definition of "Chaotic Good"...now lets see Putin roll some D12s....

We copy the Indian scammers....

We grab the Russian phone book, insert the numbers into a metric shit ton of auto dialers.

We run the auto dialers 24/7 and play a record anti Putin message....

We will either sleep deprive the Russian population and reduce efficiency or they will take there phones of the hook reducing communication ability.

Or if we're really lucky we crash their exchanges and stop all telephone communications in parts of the country and if we're lucky and the Russians are using civilian infrastructure to piggyback russian military work we might be able to black out russian hardliners so they have to rely on satalites coms for everything.

Now I just need to get this idea to some clever people.
>"Sign them up for GOP and Trump fundraising emails. That will be enough to drive them all crazy," one user suggested.

They're all already on those lists.
If this is true that's big Ooof for russia side
I have always said we should just play Putin at his own game and give a silent nod to the Annonomus and 4chan types to hack away at Russia just like he does with their troll farms.
This is good, maybe it'll send a strong message that the world doesn't like bullies.
This seems to be one of those moments where everyone in the world has to show their true colors. It's been pretty eye opening.
So, the list has a bunch of email addresses. We can probably trace the server IP that the MX records point to and flood them to disrupt their mail servers.
Fuck Putin

Yo anonymous! Why don’t you guys hack Russia today and just run a broadcast of Putin with clown makeup getting fucked in the ass 24/7 until the war stops?
This is 100% not a database dump and is just someone trying to get attention by faking hacktivist leaks to get hype misdirected.

2.6 terabyte leak of Panamanian shell company data reveals "how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, celebrities and professional athletes."

The main German news programme (Tagesschau) just described it as "the biggest set of data journalists have ever laid hands on".

(Given that a German newspaper received the documents first and did most of the groundwork (which OP has just linked to), I guess it was published at 8pm CEST to coincide with the main Tagesschau broadcast of the day.)
Christ

> In the past 12 months, around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents.
Great to see a real score for investigative journalism here. There's life in the old dog yet in this click-bait world.

Ohhhh boy. From the live thread:

>The Editor in Chief of Süddeutsche Zeitung responded to the lack of United States individuals in the documents, saying to "Just wait for what is coming next".

Dis gon be good.
The article doesn't say it, but the  *folder* IS the shell company. One file cabinet can hold hundreds of companies. There's no waiting room for these companies. No office. No manned phone. Nothing. Only that folder and its contents. The tangible part of a shell company weighs less than a ream of copy paper. The intangible part of the company is massive. 

>Mossack Fonseca created a folder for each shell firm. Each folder contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents. In some instances, there are several thousand pages of documentation.
/r/PanamaPapers

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!
From the "About the Panama Papers" section on the site, in case you want a quick summary: "Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.

In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."
Everything is going crazy in Iceland because of the scale of our role in this huge leak compared to our size in the world. The PM is heavily criticized for these corrupt actions and people are already calling for him to resign. There have always been a few rich and powerful corrupt individuals in Iceland and now they're finally getting exposed so I hope that will make a change in our government and other high ranking people. Only thing i'm scared about is the image of Iceland being ruined just like in the 2008 banking crisis and the volcanic eruption in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010.

Edit: There will be held protests in front of the Icelandic parliament at 17:00 UTC local time (19:00 CEST). It looks like a few thousand people are attending the protests, including me.
Venezuelan here. I'm my country right now there's a whole movement with this leak. The website [Armando Info](http://www.armando.info/) set a new webpage for those parts of the leak regarding my country ( http://panamapapersvenezuela.com/ , currently down but it will surely resume service as soon as possible). Things like members of the military opening accounts in Seychelles four days after Maduro's election victory and the boss of Venezuela's interpol being a drug trafficker. This could have a deep impact here considering we are right now on an almost humanitarian crisis in which people are dying from preventable diseases due to shortages of medicines thanks in great part to exchange controls and corruption around such exchange control schemes.

This is historic

Edit: This is a Channel 4 documentary on the shortage of medicines in case you want to know more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKocOdxTzvs&feature=youtu.be
In Iceland, the leaked files show how Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson and his wife secretly owned an offshore firm that held millions of dollars in Icelandic bank bonds during that country’s financial crisis .

The files include a convicted money launderer who claimed he’d arranged a $50,000 illegal campaign contribution used to pay the Watergate burglars, 29 billionaires featured in Forbes Magazine’s list of the world’s 500 richest people and movie star Jackie Chan, who has at least six companies managed through the law firm.

The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse’s vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.

“Thanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas,” one of the crooks said as they departed.

British media dubbed the heist the “Crime of the Century.” Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England’s underworld.

Now documents within Mossack Fonseca’s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, Jürgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink’s-Mat plotters.

 On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.

The following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.

For those rights, Ove paid $1.

But the money trail didn’t end there.

The same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.

It too paid $1.

In the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.

Family members of at least eight current or former members of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi’s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.

The leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.

The world’s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.


Biggest leak in the history of data journalism, according to Snowden. And it's about corruption. 

This is great news.


**edit 7: [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/wp1fvdxxwb45/)**

Over 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to

Before reading further: 
Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:

>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can "spend" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*

Edit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)

Edit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)

Edit3: [here](https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs)  are some graphs generated from the data showing it goes back to the 80s. The official site is very informative and what is in there. I guess they will also have them for download somewhere...

edit4:

big hands to /u/AsshatVik composing the list of head of states (as /u/kaisermatias said, most of the names on the list are head of governments not head of states...):
    
    The 12 heads of state are:

    Mauricio Macri, president or Argentina.

    Bidzina Ivanishvill. ex PM of Georgia

    Sigmundur something something, PM of Iceland.

    Ayad H. Allawi, ex PM of Iraq.

    Ali Abu-Ragheb, ex PM of Jordan.

    Hamad Jasim J.M. Al-Thani, ex PM of Qatar.

    Sheik Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar.

    HRH Prince Salman, King of Saudi Arabia

    Ahmad Al-Nirghani, ex-president of Sudan

    Sultan Al-Nahyan, president of the UAE.

    Pavlo Lazarenko, ex-PM of Ukraine.

    Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine.

    Update of /u/AsshatVik

    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.


    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.
     

    8 High echelon communist party members of People's Republic of China also used their services. Xi Jinping is amongst them, who's linked to two businesses in the British Virgin Islands.





edit 5:
[here](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) you have a nice website where also Relatives/associates of country leaders of people on the list are listed (which themselves are again on the list)



*obligatory: THANKS FOR THE GOLD STRANGERS!!*



edit 6: **For all germans**. There are germans on the list. No politicians (or other high stake figures) but new evidence on the siemens scandal (from the top of my head I don't know which he was referring to..;D) for example. Mossak Fonseca is helping germans massively in the act of tax evasion.  There is not a single german bank not on the list except "Sparkasse" etc... (those who are more or less government affiliated) **for non germans** not all names are already leaked since the journalists give those on the list the opportunity to comment on the accusation. (as seen with the pm of iceland)

That was released on April 1? Wow. It truly shows the excellent work done by all those journalists involved in this, keeping the leak in secret until now. I mean, it's quite astonishing to think all of the info they've had for so long and Mossack Fonseca had no idea about  what was going on. 

I've just started the [German Wiki article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers). A draft for the [English Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers) already existed.
A comment by a reader of BBC's take on the [Panama Papers](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844) leak finds it hilarious that BBC, a broadcaster paid for by British tax payers, has a subheading in that article titled "Russian connection" describing various dealings of Russian characters who are "close associates" of Putin and an equally sordid "Iceland connection" but not even a mention of David Cameron's father's tax evading schemes listed in the documents which the people of Great Britain should be vastly more interested in. Not to mention direct implications of various other western puppets (Saudi King, Ukrainian PM, Iraqi former PM) and other dubious "connections".

Which is why it's good that this massive pile of data is analyzed by a huge load of international newspapers.

This way, papers can selectively publish stuff that won't put themselves in too grave danger - just look what happened to The Guardian with the Snowden leak (visits from three-letter agency officials) or what happens in Turkey, Ukraine or Hungary with media that dares to publish stuff too offensive to the respective regimes.


The real trick is getting people to care en masse so something can actually be done to fix it. 
This is crazy. Check this out to understand the scale of tax fraud: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/billion-dollar-o-gram-2013/

Sources behind the infographic estimate that **there are more money in tax havens than the total cost of the latest financial crisis**

Sadly, I don't think anything will come of this.
I feel like Mr. Robot season 2 is writing itself.
This *could* be one of the biggest and most important leaks of all time.

Maybe finally people will wake up and realise that the entire world economic system is completely corrupted.
The harsh reality is that none of your information is safe from the richest and most powerful people in the world. There is solace in the fact that, on the other end, none of their information is safe from us.


The term "whistleblower" is backwards and already outdated, and any conversation discussing what your government is lying to you about is a good one. You deserve transparency from your rulers. Leaks like these are the only remaining power the populace has over our government. The founding fathers would be proud of this.

ELI5?
"The little guy will pay for it"

Sums up a little more than banking I think.
I think it's incredibly telling, that none of the major American news outlets (CNN, NBC or Politico) have anything about this on their websites. I would at least expect some small article mentioning what's happening, but there is literally nothing at all!
This is incredible - there is potentially enough data there to keep even the most skilled forensic data experts busy for years. Who knows what will tumble out.

That said, I hate to be cynical, but can't see how this will ever fully be investigated or reported by newspapers owned by many of the wealthy conglomerates likely to be exposed here.
So.... are you guys going to go riot or what?  I need to go to bed early tonight, but I'll stay up if you're going to get all smashy-smashy.
Certain things like the double dutch sandwich, intracompany loans, and price altering are well-known when it comes to corporate tax management, but preserving personal wealth through the use of offshore trusts has always been a convoluted mess to understand. The people that specialize in it get paid well because navigating the loopholes has gotten more and more difficult over the years. I am really excited to see how the inner workings of these things work. I don't have money by any means but this stuff has always been interesting to me.
Supposedly, one of the worst people hit by these leaks is Putin, as it has the paper trail for how he makes his friends and himself wealthy. This leak could literally be a game changer on a scale never yet seen in the world.     
      
Edit: To all the people replying, two things. First of all, this isnt our fight unless it is our country, already Iceland are calling for snap election, and those leaders like Putin, Assad an others we cant effect, they have enemies like the US and others who will act on drying up the cash flow.  Secondly, those who say corruption is what rules the world need to remember that corruption is what kills Capitalism, as for it to work it needs to be a fair competition and more companies and nations want this competition as they see the corruption as a glass ceiling that needs breaking for them to stand a chance.   
To all the people here saying "What does it matter?" and anything of the like: 

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

Or don't. It's your choice.

Wonder if this is still relevant
This is incredible. Good journalistic work done here.

This is the most terrifying thing I have read in a long time.  Whilst I dont think much of the bildeberg or the illuminati conspiracies, that all these influential individuals use one firm, to hide their wealth, do corrupt deals, and influence the world in such a large way, makes me wonder how many other firms just like this there are who have not had documents leaked. The world is truly screwed 
It's always somewhat disappointing when information like this comes out. Not because I feel bad for the companies, but a lot of folks often feel there's some sort of global corruption ring, explicit or implicit, tied up in international finance and such. And the disappointment comes from when that is absolutely correct - that such corporations defy our brighter visions and ideals in their pursuit of financial gain. Hopefully there's some significant fallout from this.
I've spent the last year working on a paper about offshore asset protection trusts, and it's incredibly exciting that this world is about to be made public. These practices are carried out on the basis of winks and handshakes, and the whole offshore financial industry is built on self preservation through discretion. Disclosure of this magnitude is astounding, I'm looking forward to what happens next. Organisations like the FATF have been piling pressure on offshore jurisdictions for years, trying to force them to regulate asset protection practices more closely. This sort of leak provides exactly the sort of ammunition they need.
They said Assange was crazy, that his way of investigative journalism and full public disclosure was criminal, and that no one else would be following in his footsteps.

Only ten years have passed since he founded Wikileaks and look at his legacy: Manning, Snowden, now this. 

His life is difficult, but I bet he feels incredibly proud
A quick look - this is all over BBC, The Guardian, Le Monde, The Irish Times websites. Front, huge font. 


It is nowhere on NYTimes, CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, USAtoday, LA Times.

It is astonishing how pacified the US is. Just astounding. It's not because the citizens are dumb and uneducated. They've just been trained not to care. Unreal. It's like an alternate universe.
:/ this died to fast. What ever happened to these people? 
This type of corruption has always been practically a fact, but having actual data to back this up is incredible.  Now the question is, given the government is probably in on it already, is anything really going to get done?  I guess now they might not have a choice.  Before they could just pretend they did not know.
The jokes on you.  While you guys are talking about his supposed story, CNN is reporting on the real stuff.  Their main story is a woman's soccer player getting a DUI.

Nice try Reddit.  Nothing to see here 
Trillions of unpaid tax dollars... While these people play and live the good life... If that money had been in the system, it would have created jobs. It would have been continual economic stimulus. The underfunded projects would have gone funded. The world WOULD be a much different place!

This can not be left alone. I'm curious to see how the world takes this news over the next few weeks...
Waiting for the US names to leak. Fingers crossed for Clinton, Trump and a gaggle of federal legislators 
Sounds like something Reddington orchestrated
surprised this is - not - 
on the frontpage of NYTimes.com, 

nor LATimes.com , 

nor WSJ.com ; 

Nor CNN.com


nor MarketWatch.com ;

 nor reuters.com

the Panama Papers story -is- on the websites of:

theguardian.com/us

on CNBC.com top of plage

chicagotribune.com

PS: in the exceedingly unlikely chance that any journalist who worked on this major story sees this - a great many people say "THANK YOU"
Is there a way to keep a story on the front page for a while longer than normal for world affecting instances such as this?  Like a sticky post for a week?
The fact that no Americans are named in this list just means they are using a different shady company.
Damn this is getting real guys, JFK tried to warn us in his address before the american newspaper publishers association in 1961.
    
     "It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."

 Except now things are actually being revealed. Lets hope this gets major news coverage.
Only 149 documents out of 11 million have been released. Just those 149 documents have already taken down one world leader. Ponder that for a moment.
I have a feeling that All the news in America will do some in depth reports on Kim Kardashian the day this is released.
[deleted]
RemindMe! 7 days, check which world leaders have gotten away with this shit.

*hopes he is wrong for once.*
I wonder if any incredibly wealthy prospective US Presidential candidates might be implicated in this...

Just when the campaign was getting a bit quiet.
Please sticky this.
How has this been down voted from 17k to 8k? 
The full [interview](http://www.aftenposten.no/okonomi/Islands-statsminister-har-selskap-i-skatteparadis-8415890.html) were the prime minister of Iceland gets confronted, for people that are interested.

This corruption lies deeper than what is shown. Its getting bigger everyday. The strangest thing is how some people thought this to be shocking. The social divide in classes are gigantic. And here people are in the U.S. crying to each other about anti establishment and socialism when they should be rallying together to put an end to corruption to make it fair for all. It is most definitely not fair for all. If you dont play ball with key figures, you move nowhere. And playing ball usually involves immoral and unjustified behavior.
Karma's dropping rapidly on this, down around 400 in the last few minutes. Is this caused by the auto-downvote system?
It's not getting downvoted; it's been solidly at 95% upvotes since this morning. Points naturally decay over time, so after the initial surge of interest things tend to start of slip down the list. 
5 years ago David Cameron said he wanted to stop offshore accounts in Britain and now his father has been named in the biggest leak of all time... The Labour party will have a field day at the PMQ's
Didn't this post have over 11000 points yesterday? Now it is only 8814.

Why is that?
The real story isn't just all the amount of money flowing around, but who *let* all that money just flow around.

I'm certain we'll find some big names in politics on this list.

Maybe even someone who is running for president.

Maybe even several someones.
