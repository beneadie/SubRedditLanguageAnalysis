Beluga Whale playing some rugby

Ben Skeen will be reviewing this footage after he's done reviewing the contentious Fleming archer being offside at Hastings in 1066.
THIS IS AMAZING

TMO clearly missed a few knock ons though
Its Alun Whale Jones 

Whaaales Whaaaaales Whaaaales
How many times is he going to knock it on before the whistle goes?
"Some of them are actually nice"

\-Beluga chatting about humans with whale community

How many people can say they've played fetch with a beluga?
I don't have anything clever to say, but I do love this a great deal.
Wait, where do you tackle a beluga? Behind, or under the pectoral fins?
Whaley le Roux??

Also, how did they discover that the whale was willing to do this?!
One of the coolest things I've seen.
Forward pass then knocked on. Poor form.
Jacob Stockwhale
That’s a strange dog
[deleted]
Better ball handling skills than most players with that amount of blubber.

Eligible for Wales too by way of the dad joke and bad pun laws.

6N here we come!
That's insane
Knock on....... Scrum on the beluga 22 =)
Fin Russell...
I love when old school props get all majestic like that.
Not sure what's weirder, the rugby playing whale, or south africans in ice water, where the hell is this?
Maybe poor Beluga was like “STOP THROWING TRASH INTO MY HONE YOU DUMB HUMAN”.
So many subs this will be posted to, but really /r/NatureIsFuckingLit is where is belongs, go get your karma OP quickly before someone else does
You've heard of Underhill, now get ready for Underwater!
OK, not only is this a good place to end my internet engagement for the day, now I want this played to me on an endless feedback loop when I am on my deathbed.
At least Wilson has a friend.
It's the rwc 2019 rugby ball too
Definitely some South Africans on this boat.
Just a guess, but I bet this is Hvaldimir, that friendly whale that showed up in Norway.
Better than England in the final... :(
This is exceptional content
I bet he's real slippery in the contact
Fucking get him in the england squad, he can’t be any worse than Dan Cole at tighthead
Strange seeing Whales play in white
Rugger Blubber
Hi from r/all, weird rugby people
Looks a lot like Jacob Stockcube.
I've heard he's signed for Sale sharks
Damn whales are so clever
Where’s the TMO clearly a forward pass and a few knock ons
Serious question.

Does he automatically qualify to play for Wales?
Is that the beluga whale the Russians trained for spying?
Meh... not good enough to play A-side or B-side. Definitely a SEA-side player
Thanks for the silver & gold kind strangers! This is not my video btw.

That's definitely a knock on.
The best thing I've ever seen
Amazing to have an interaction like that with a wild animal.
Lol i heard that saracens already gave him a contract and hired his familly at a seaworld
GET HIM ONSIDE REF!
Hvaldimir the great!
Give it a fish!
Pretty insane sub-aquatic carry to be honest.
God feel so wholesome now
Amazing
This is exactly what i needed to start my day man, thanks man, this is truly amazing and wholesome.
this is so incredibly wholesome. Beluga whales are awesome
Amazing!
‘Hey stop throwing your trash in my ocean.’

-whale
Dude knocked it on. Can only advance the ball forward with your feet.
maaaaaaaagnifique
This is incredible!
“Stop throwing trash in the ocean human! Don’t... don’t you throw that agai- son of a bitch. This is the last time I’m getting it. Keep it in the- gawd stahp throwing it! Asshole!”
"Dude, keep your trash in your boat!"
Embiid playing 23 minutes.
that's a forward pass.
Whale is like, "please take it back don't pollute the water".
Forward pass right at the start there
I’m cold just watching this
That water looks coooold
What's source on this?
Do these animals like returning shit they find in the see nearby boats. I've seen a couple of vids with these whales returning shit. 
Edit: spelling
Forward pass surely
Thank you so much for sharing this! Truly amazing! It made my week!
[deleted]
/u/vredditdownloader
holy shit that's amazing. Hopefully the whale won't try to approach some less friendly humans in the future.
whale, probably: Stop throwing your trash in my home!
He’s prolly like keep your trash on your boat.
You walk on land,
I swim in sea.
Turns out we both play rugby.
You throw ball far,
and I go fetch.
Now we're best friends
You bet you bet!
How can we not value the life of sea animals, or general animals. We see them more as props and we are starting to realize they are more than they appear
That is a weird dog
Meanwhile I'm throwing apple pieces to a kangaroo and it doesn't understand it can eat it...
Where is this?? Anyone know
A most beautiful and heart warming connection.
This wild beluga whale plays fetch better than my dog.
"Do NOT litter MY ocean, darn it!" - beluga whale
haha love it
“Stop throwing shit into my fucking ocean, simian!”
u/vredditdownloader
the whale is like "this human is so silly, I keep giving him his ball and he keeps throwing it away"
r/nextfuckinlevel
r/aww
I hear a few SA accents, bru (and Scandinavian). We aren't built for such cold.
its like "dude wtf stop polluting my ocean, take this trash with you"
[removed]
Beluga is like "what a clumsy jerk, ok I'll get it one last time but you are an unfit mother and need to be more careful with your egg".
Waiting for a team to be nicknamed 'Belugas'
This is awesome
I'd be so up for jumping into the sea just to pet and pat the good boi!
That head nod at 1:03
TIL beluga whales are dogs.
What kind of dog is that?
Imagine if the whale just thinks the human is bring dumb dropping things in the ocean and is being helpful by bringing it back to him.
This is how I want to die.  Crushed by a breaching whale while swimming in the ocean.
r/likeus
u/vredditdownloader
That was nice to watch... Thanks for sharing!
“There is enough trash in the ocean. Please stop throwing your weird bal-...dammit, man.”
Is this what happened to Wilson?
/u/vredditdownloader
Melts my heart
Sir you've lost your ball! Excuse me... SIR! Here you are. AGH GAST! You've lost it again. Fear not!
The beluga must have thought it was an egg and kindly return it and only to toss it back and the beluga is like *just one more and I'm gonna tear down your MF vessel*
Is the whale Canadian? Can he play scrumhalf or flyhalf?
What is the most impressive thing is that the beluga know the ball is fragile so he handles it very carefully.
That's the same whale that played fetch with the iPhone, right?
Right, that's a forward pass. Back 10 boys.
Imagine being able to say that you did this wow
South African boat. Obviously.
Take care of our oceans, please world.
Still better under the high ball than Daly.
Those colors are just breathtaking
Beluga whales should be protected at all costs.
"Please quit throwing shit in my ocea- God damn it You did it again. Okay but this is the last time."
Whales and dolphins are so amazing...it’s so sad when people put them in aquariums, they’re too smart to treat like that!
Maybe he is just like: "uhm guys, why do you throw that waste into my sea? I know that humans wont take that trash out by themselves so here you got that thing back. No wait why you are throwing that agaaaiiiiinnn?"
I don't know enough to answer you yet!
“Silly land whales always losing their stuff..here you go..aww mate”
He saved some guys GoPro, after it fell into the water as well.
A really cool little detail there at the end of the video. When the guy is shaking the ball at the Beluga to get its attention, the whale nods its head like, "yes I know what we're doing, just throw the damn thing!"
u/vredditdownloader
That is just so fucking cool. I would love to just experience something like this in person.
You can’t forward pass in rugby.
This is just about the coolest and most majestic thing I've seen in all my 35 years.  What an amazing video.
Thats a forward pass, not allowed
Animals are one of my favorites things in this damn world
u/vredditshare
Did they know the beluga would do that before going out there?  Why would they bring a rugby ball on the boat?  And why else would they throw it?  Maybe the whale was part of an aqua park or something and they knew it in advance?
"Damnit, stop littering!!"
Forward pass bro
"Dude, for the last time, no littering."
The nod before the second throw made me so damn happy
Anyone going to talk about the illegal forward pass?
How did they discover the whale would do this is what I want to know
Holding on under water, penalty against white.
This is adorable
He's a dog with fins!
Well I've got some news for you
Clear forward pass. Throws the game into complete disrepute!
Definite couple of knock ons there.
What an adventure. I hoe I travel someday and not get stuck. :(
I fucking love this so damn much
u/vredditdownloader
Beluga: so i met these humans, and they kept throwing their trash in the sea, and i gave it back. But they were shameless.
Water dog plays fetch
Every man and his beluga making a rugby joke
Well, this blew up fast. Now I can't avoid my jealousy for the guys in the video. Thanks.
That’s a really big dog
Is the ball now called a flukey?
Does he have any Scottish ancestry? Asking for a friend.
Belugas, and whales in general, are so intelligent and amazing. It infuriates me to no end that places like Seaworld still exist and cage these beautiful creatures in a fucking swimming pool.
Isn't that water lethally cold for the whale or any fish in particular to live in?
Absolutely love this game, just started playing a couple months ago as a flanker and it’s so much fun
He's a great support runner, well able to hold his depth.
Mindblowing
Fuck. So cute.
“Hey babe, how was work today” 
Me: “pretty good, played fetch with a FUCKING WHALE”
In America we just call that fetch
I guess he's a sub
u/vredditdownloader
Forward pass...
Imagine playing fetch with a whale. That's pretty epic
1st time: "Sir, please, dont litter"

2nd: "Sir. Please. Do not litter"

3rd: "Aw, fuck".
I believe what that whale is trying to say is: "*Please capture me, keep me in a small tank, and force me to perform 4 shows per day!*"

That was an audition.
it took me too much time to understand that the weird clouds in the "sky" were actually the sides of a snowy mountain
TIL Whales like to play fetch.
Wow that was pretty incredible
Definitely a couple of forward passes in this clip...
That’s pretty awesome
Ball is life
r/all :

*allow us to introduce ourselves*
Human keeps throwing plastic trash into the ocean despite Beluga's effort to make him clean it up and take it home.
it just wants to play... doesnt even want a fish.... we shouldnt keep whales or dolphins in cages... close sea world today.
.
THAT WERE DIABOLICAL!
I get enough of this from my dog.
Is this the same beluga that retrieved the cell phone ??
I love this.
Well he threw the ball like a football one 😐
terrible technique you cant pass forward, and pickups have to be kicked forward, 0/10
Just like my sisters single mother team
Would make some prop
Wales vs whales who says no?
"here's your ball back! Wait.... No, don't drop it again!!!"
11.9k upvotes and I miss it, fucks sake. Hi to all the r/all people!
Lekker!
Definitive sea puppies
Amazing. Pure and simple. That's amazing.
I spotted a knockon there
Omg! So amazing to connect with other species
Forward pass there.
What a cutie!
This. Is. Amazing! Was it trained to do this?
Forward pass sir!
r/petthedamnfish
These fking humans. They keep throwing junk in the ocean and I keep giving it back to them. What do they think... This is a fking game
no forward passing
Imagine losing to south Africa 🤔🤷‍♂️
It's actually just saying "stop throwing shit in my backyard, you stupid human".
he just doesn't want you littering the oceans
Whale rugby looks fun
Thatvwas a forward Pass!
Ummm. It’s not rugby if it has a forward pass is it?
Honestly this is just so cool, something about it being in the ocean makes it so much cooler than like if it was a monkey in the jungle.
Who doesn’t like playing catch?
That’s amazing!!
That’s a strange looking dog.
Whale a cheat, can’t throw forward in rugby
Absolutely fascinatingly wonderful!!!
Funny, Baluga is a derogatory name for black people in Tagalog but their dolphin is white
These Whales could win a game
They’re so casual about it lol
That is so fucking cool
Human to his friends: I played fetch with a whale!

Whale to his friends: This human would NOT stop throwing his trash in the water, so I kept throwing it back into his boat.
🙂
Is this the Russian traitor whale living in Norway haha?
TMO Ben skeen has decided that their was no forward pass in this passage of play.
Call a nice game of fetch "rugby" and then have fun translating the comments. I can't understand a word anyone is saying, but I can hear the Celtic lilt pouring off the screen like a banshee, Lord! You're all drunk lol

I'm not an animal expert but aren't the lions in the above picture either young *male ones whose job as members of a lion pride is to protect their king, his female companions and children from other male lions, or part of a pride consisting of only male lions who are considered "losers" because they aren't a king so can't breed? Their manes look weak.  
EDIT: IMO, [this is a better pic for the lions](http://imgur.com/FeUJYFH)

Wow the Silver Ferns beat the Lions? Good job girls.
Everytime... 
Leaf wins.

FATALITY 
[deleted]
Well, according to the circle of life, lions get eaten by grass, so I guess the leaf wins.
I'm just some American idiot but even I know that leaf is some lion taming shit. 
They wanted a fearsome icon for our rugby team. I told them to use the Haast eagle, but did they listen???
I am a leaf on the wind. Watch me soar.....to the try line.

a leaf of [oleander](https://www.britannica.com/plant/oleander) might put of a good fight
I've been studying lads! It's the leaf! Right? Huh, right?
Leafs. They knocked me out for 10 hours straight one time. So I'll leaf it at that. 
I was hoping "a leaf" would be used for this all week lol
The leaf is silver, which is thence melted and poured into a bullet mold.
The Leaf. Obvi

What is this leaf thing?
All it is one leaf to break a lion SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK
currently a leaf is winning.... Future me says will win everytime
what kind of leaf?
Woo
Leaves 
Who *should* win...
This is almost asking if a ton of leaves would kill a man.  And the answer is Yes. 
I was gonna say hey /r/funny that's the all blacks logo then I luld

So why didn't OP put an all black man as the picture?

Oh, nevermind...
i always thought it was a feather
I am a leaf on the win, watch how I score.
bwahaha, i guess leaves won over the lions
Lions. Cause the All Blacks would have to do the haka first...

As an aside, this jersey is from around 2007ish. Was lucky enough to go to the Japan Russia game last week and probably 60-70% of the crowd had Japan jerseys and about 95% had the new 2019 jerseys. Didn't realise my 2007 jersey would be so retro. Shows hosting the world cup has brought a lot of new rugby fans in Japan (and I'm sure a few more after this game!)

Japan's rise in Rugby is simply a large scale plot to give /u/UpTheCherryBlossoms karma, isn't it?
Well lads, you know what to do. Let's get him to the top.
So happy I got to watch 2 absolutely timeless moments for Japan!
You’re back! And alive! Congrats, I’m gonna go drink some beer and forget about this

Congratulations, what a win for Japan. Maybe these kinds of results won't be seen as shocks soon, that team are very impressive.
Absolutely fucking thrilled for you mate. Go on, Japan!
Ireland > All Blacks. Japan > Ireland. Japan > All Blacks.
This is great, I was just thinking about your post after the match!
See you in 4 years when you beat New Zealand in France in the pool stages
You're going to #1 again mate
Take your upvote.
Might be a shit photo but that was an unreal game! One of the best team performances I’ve seen
Be happy while you can. Know that we are coming for you..
Good to see you back mate :)
Get drunk and be smug.
I just checked your post history and I was at that game against South Africa, supporting the Springboks. I’ve never left a stadium with more conflicted feelings, being devastated and also humbled. Enjoy your successes again today!
I see that you've got a larger TV - you've let the fame get to your head!
Looking forward to your next pic in four years

This is so great (again!)

You've been visited by the AWJ of good fortune.

Physically screamed when I heard the result. Studied Japanese, visited the country and I'm now obsessed. So proud!
An upvote for you. I'm hoping this means that the old game won't be on repeat anymore 😵
We’ve come full circle, well done lad
I'm  not seeing a shit photo, all I'm seeing is victory.
I think you posted a fucking amazing picture of you by mistake.

Some questionable advice

as long as it goes backwards out of the hand
This is where NFL started
>.co.nz

Checks out
Refs advice to NZ
If you're facing the person you pass it to, this is correct.
A comma would have been so beneficial
Seem like accurate advice for aspiring All Black players. You have to keep up the traditions.
Is this merch from that movie with Hayley Joel Osment and Jon Bon Jovi?
"Claim your momentum took it forward"
ahh yes. the good old Aussie flat ball
It’s to remind the forwards to occasionally pass the ball
Kiwi conspiracy to make everyone else worse so they can regain dominance

Good on em
Just like Scotland.
Someone call Nige
I think we all prefer this outcome to the current alternative, infinite box kicks.
Got an STI? pass it forward
Wayne Barnes: play on
haha wtf
Someone had to of used the excuse that it says to pass forward
Just don't get caught ha
This message is approved by Mitch moses the king of passing it forward
Needs a comma. 
Pass it, forward! ( if only for the backs to kick it out..)
I've never seen emu eggs look like this. Strange.
Do not touch Willie, okay good advice!
This made me laugh
Isn't that a violation of the rules bruv?
Double it and give it to the next person
Dont watch or play rugby but dont they literally throw it backwards when the game starts 😭
See I tried this once in rugby, ended up getting in deep shit for it. Don’t pass it forward when you’re at the try line
It's a message from the refs to the All Black's...
Must be an Aussie ball.
r/crappydesign
Shit sport. Shit ball. Shit advice. Volkanovski got robbed Change my mind

One could even think that was their intended joke.
Park ball, left in your local park/rugby club to encourage participation.
Works for Leinster
American football> this trash ass sport
If we are talking Rugby Union, then seems legit.
If I catch anny of you wankers passing that forward
The players really be fighting inner demons 😰

Anyone who was apart of this knows this was probably the most fantastic and beautiful artistic collaboration.
I hate Canada
Duhan van der Merwe scores Solo Try of the Year

He has no right being so elusive while being such a unit
Wish I could have seen it live. iTV is being a bastard!
Nice of Dommers to help out at the end, did look like he wasn't going to reach the line.
[deleted]
A great score but, as an Englishman, could I just add : COULD SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A FUCKING TACKLE YOU LAZY BASTARDS.

ahem...
Career highlight reel
Scotland have never had better wings
That hand off at the end is a thing of beauty in particular.

To do that on the turn, whilst switching carrying arm after running 55 meters is just incredible.
Me oh my I have enjoyed that, yes boy
Only really watch rugby during the 6 nations but that was beautiful!!
Brilliant try
I will never tire of watching this as long as I live.
I'm on my 46th orgasm watching this.

Oh...47.
My favourite is the last defender giving him a pat on the back. 

“Well done lad, you’ve got this!”
Great run, but fucking awful defending.
A low tackle from dombranbt stops that
It was like he was covered in spiders
Somebody please tackle him
Just before this I was about to comment about him always running sideways… humble pie has never tasted so sweet
Merwe the swerve!
We dont need a vote, this is it, and its fking Feb.
Please please please please please stop posting this. 

My balls are empty & if I see this one more time I’m genuinely worried I won’t be able to have kids.
Reminds me of North for the Lions in 2013.
Just watch his legs the whole time. He never stops taking steps. He's not trying to stride out or take big cuts. He's just running about 3/4 stride steps and keeping all his power. He could probably run 10% faster, but he's giving that up for balance. Love it
I’ve watched this maybe 20 times already, including once live! Couldn’t believe it
Exhibit A of why Steward is not the best fullback in the NH
It's beautiful...
Who is the English player that decided to, rather than tackle him, give him more momentum over the line?

Because that's quality defending right there.
Duhan is a beast. 

People are acting like DOmbrandt is the reason for that, but it's one hell of a hand off and the problem comes from the disarray off the kick chase, it's a clever block that leaves the hole but that was not a good defensive line off the kick.

But still the credit for that should go to Duhan. Best winger in the world
Proud to have this south african in our mist.
This new generation of totally 100% Scottish players are great.
"Fuck it, I'll do it myself."
Beautiful, beautiful. England should have done better, though.

Overall this match bodes badly for England in a WC year. Way too much improvement needed.
Shaping up to be match of the year too
Bruh that got me hard
These motherfuckers of Scots that pick the Saffas...they know their business
Incredible
Super Saiyan mode
Proper rugby
What a guy. My son adores him and Darcy. Legend.
Absolute filth. Scotland deserved the win based on this one moment of magic from Duhan alone
This made the absolute SPANKING by the Irish a little less sore. Didn't rate VDM in the lions but hot damn this try made me stiffer than Theresa May opening a Tory conference
Brilliant try, but I imagine the view was slightly different from Kevin Sinfield’s chair.
Absolutely savage. Power, agility, vision & pace. He showed what he’s made of there, fair play , it’s a great thing to see tries like this in the day of organised defences. Even if it’s against us. Buy that man a beer (or protein shake) 👍🏻
That was lush.
Fuckin beautiful
Up there with McInally's 2019 try in the same fixture.... this really now is one of the Tests of the calendar...
Can someone edit the Benny hill music over the top, thanks!
I guess defense is optional in northern hemisphere
As an English person who has previously supported the national team: Scotland, you absolute beauts, today was so well-deserved. This try was 👌
Must be nice…
Great try, but the English defence definitely have an assist in it. Shocking stuff
I have a question: those sponsors which are in the grass, are they like actually there or edited in? (Its probs a really stupid question)😂
Liewe fok!!
South African backs running circles around the English since 2019.
Who's putting it on the hub, asking for a friend!
I mean, it's Feb and there's a world cup this year. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Amazing try.
Them some South Africa hippity and hoppity, if i've ever seen'm. Not to mention those fends...South African born moves those are for sure.
Great try from the World XV
I've been trying to learn more about the game coming from an NFL background. Good friend of mine from Ireland has been taking me to watch games at bars. What makes this so spectacular that it would even remotely be considered "try of the year"? It was a nice run I guess but didn't make me do a double take or anything. Give me the context I'm missing.

This just looked like really bad defense. Right off the bat, 13 overruns his angle then tries to turn upfield to arm tackle a much bigger guy who is running downhill. Then a bunch of plodding guys who won't square up on him. What was that at 8:22, it's like he stayed out of his way on purpose and then lunged at his feet.
Awful defence but also a slightly dodgy block from the offside player right at the start that set it up

e: looks like he crosses behind his own player fwiw. But very much expecting a plethora of downvotes and no actual counterpoints since this is England
Commentary passion we love to hear too
Rugby looks as physical as US football so why no safety gear?
Great try!

But the state of Mark Robson's commentary, some absolute waffle and nothing really related to what is currently happening and then just word soup and loud noises.
Honestly if England weren't flapping around like schoolboys it wouldn't have happened. Not a classic England made it look as such.
It’s all that sa school boy juice.
Solo try of the month. When Super Rugby starts back up you'll see plenty of them. 😅
Great run!!! but let’s give a hand for that absolutely atrocious defense for making the try happen. PS he’s South African ;)
How do you know its the solo try of the year?
Proper Scottish name
How do South African rugby players all manage to get so ridiculously jacked… 😏
u/savevideo
Glorious.
So early to call but contender for try of the year
Great try but in fairness, it does look like the guys in the white uniforms thought it was touch football
Wow
Try of the tournament so far!
I almost had a similar run back in highschool. I got so caught up on "holy shit, I'm going to make it!" that I didn't see the roid raging maniac about to destroy me. Ahh, the good old days....
That's a Try Jonha Lomu would have been proud of.
ThreeProsVs35Children.gif
Lomu-like. Wow
Champagne rugby


Was the deciding factor in the game...twickers hasnt seen a try like that since...well....
That last tackle attempt was shithouse. Amazing try nonetheless.
I don't watch the sport but that there looks more like a Do than a Try to me.
Would look so much better if it wasn’t filmed vertically.
Not English, and VdM is obviously one hell of a specimen, but that just looks fucking awful defensively no matter how many times I play it. Very disappointing for England fans. (and very enjoyable for Scotland fans ofc).
Anyone else spot Finn Russell having a sneaky shove of Farrell as the try is being scored? 

Classic shithousery.
Maradona
Finished it with a genuine Corey Jane.
Embarrassingly bad tackling, horribly disorganised kick chase followed by 5 stretching arm tackles.

Dvdm is a unit but fuck me that's shocking for international level players.
u/savevideo
Oh my goodness
Been my favourite player for a while now - as a Worcester and Scotland fan, just brilliant watching him.
Mods, please mark NSFW!
Holy fuck
u/savevideo
That last step is deadly
At the risk of sounding harsh, Alex Dombrandt's attempt was pathetic. 

He is not at this level and should probably not wear an England jersey again.
Living In the US is it great to wake up and pop on some rugby with breakfast.
Certainly will be a contender, I'm sure. But with such a big year ahead (the world cup, namely), I would say calling it the try of the year this early in the year is a tad optimistic.
u/savevideo
acceleration, and that last step was gold. although some piss weak defence too.
Its was a two man job, they guy standing pefectly still to block farrel palyed a big part. Still an excelent try.
Weak AF from Dombrandt.
Watching it all I could mumble was "oh shit oh shit oh shit uh oh, did he try to push him over? FFS going to be seen this try for years to come"
As a sale fan, part of me loves South African immigration, on the other hand, Duhan van der Merwe exists.
No.1 contender for try of the year anyway (so far🤣)
He did exceptionally well. The defense was poor but he was absolutely flying and he stepped Van Poortvliet at pace and almost simultaneously handed off Dombrandt. Amazing.
[removed]
Legitimately think this is the best individual try I’ve ever seen
So glad we brought in a rugby league legend to help our tackling. Really effective.
/u/savevideo
Schoolboy fantasy stuff. That man will never put his hand in his pocket in a Scottish pub ever again.
Solo try of the year is a bit preemptive considering we still have every competition under the sun still to come this year, including a world cup. But definitely a great try!
He is a unit- brilliant try against a poor opposition. But take nothing away breathtaking speed and skill!
Open field tackling. It's a thing.
Wasn't solo. That England player gave him a wee nudge at the end to help him over the line lol.
Scotland taking a leaf out of the old saracens play book. If in doubt import a South african
Cunts fuckin rapid
England: NFL tackle mode - ON
I hope that the whole England squad spend a whole training session doing intensive tackle practice. The amount of missed tackles was horrendous. It’s almost like we had a full squad of George fords
What a proud Scotsman
As a proud Englishman I’m really glad my surname is Scott here and I’ll be applying for residency shortly.
Ah our good old Dutch, Cape and Scottish star
There was just no way they'd catch him
He really tried
Not a fan of rugby - or sports in general

That was slick af, incredibly impressive
What a play!
Still feel like Dombrandt should have smashed him
Gid Glesga name that.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🔥🔥
For years to come this will be shown to young wingers to inspire them. Great run!
After every dive, all i hear is NYOOOOOM
Shame he’s not Scottish
Haha solo try of the year or 5 pathetic tackle attempts (especially Dombrant 🙈)
It’s a brilliant try, dombrandts tackle was poor
Anyone saying he has no business being "this nimble and this big" obviously doesn't watch rugby that often...
Unbelievable try I hope he has a fantastic tournament but absolute garbage defending from the England team.
Why the last guy just give him a jogging cuddle instead of actually tackling?
🇿🇦
Insane ability for sure but piss poor defending also. Especially that last attempt - are people scared of diving these days ??
Do they not teach tackling in rugby union?
Well done South Africa!
when you run for a beer and the store closes in 5 minutes)
I think it was Farrell who should have made the first up tackle - he just stops and waves goodbye 👋
What a great try by South Africa
Try of the year?? Its fu king February🤦‍♂️
Test this man
If you see a chance, take it
All credit to Duhan, but god wouldn’t it be funny if the saes defend like that against Italy
they had to win something because they didn't make it to the world cup lol
Times like this I wish I cared about rugby.
He's so Scottish! 🤣
That gave me goosebumps so it did. 

Wales, I hope you are taking some notes.
Reminds me of that Scott Gibbs try
Pure dead fuckin brilliant 👏 👌 🙌 🤣 😂
A Scott Gibbs feel to that one
They need to learn how to tackle.
Superb try
I’m English and all I have to say is “bloody good show chap! Well done!”
This is a solid version of Scotland with some frightfully good players. They've always had some solid characters but have never been able to come together to form a solid team. This is the next evolution.
Bloody hell that's a beauty try
 Anyone know how he fixed his knees?
u/savevideo
My dad was out of his seat shouting at the tv…
So was I… best performance I’ve seen from Scotland in a while
Opened the English up like a pack of crisps. Brilliant try.
This boy's a seriously major unit 😃
Bokke power
One of the best tries I’ve ever seen
Van de Merwe is OP, needs a nerf soon
Dombrandt (last man to wave him through) should be ashamed of himself.

Still a great try.
Dont understand why people alwasy tackle high in rugby these days, if that last man hadve gone low round the legs, he couldve got him down.
Absolutely vandermervellous.
Hellva a run boys
Sounds very Scottish
That’s Sunday morning defending
I know they have said no to above weight height tackles but didn’t know they fully got rid of tackling altogether.
Even in a UK game South Africans still manage to score
Absolute gangster
Name sounds like a man with a plan
Credit to him for scoring it, but you've got to admit that it's awful defending from England.
Absolute magic fair play!
If you just listen to the crowd you would think this happened at murrayfield.
Hell of a run
Great try, had to double check I wasn't watching Rugby League for a minute there
Never seen such embarrassing attempts at tackling 😂
Good old Scottish name that.
Good Scottish name if ever I’ve heard one lol. Is he of Dutch heritage by any chance or something like that
Also look up Jona Lomu on you tube
Not even a fan of rugby but this was impressive
When I say the pub I was in exploded even that is an understatement
Proper Scottish name that
So, for the moment, Scotland has the highest world ranking of any UK team.
Maybe the English should sack the coach?
uh how can they allow a southafrican to play for scotland?
this reminds me of those games whee they let the special kid get a touchdown where they all pretend to tackle.
Get a man who looks at you the way Farrell looks at the all blacks

~~#84 #58~~ #43 on /r/all at the moment

Think we hit #41, not sure we got any higher before dropping off.

[Dan Cole during Haka](https://imgur.com/a/Bv4RdNh)
The smirk of a man that's seen all possible futures.
By the way am I the only one who thinks this haka (and in general for this WC) was filmed awfully? The constant angle changes ruined it.
Images That Precede Unfortunate Events Part 2.
Had everyone laughing in the pub when it cut to him
I knew this one would get posted. Can you imagine the sensations and emotions going through his head in a moment like that? He must 90% adrenaline
I remember reading during the week that teams aren't allowed to go too close to the haka when it's performed, and sure enough, today we saw the referees push England back. In my mind, that's ridiculous. The All Blacks will haka, and it's up to opposition teams to choose how they respond to it.
I already had bet on England before, but the moment I saw their opposition to the haka, along with that smirk, I knew they'd win. And they won by much more than I thought.
It's like he knew what was coming
the look of a man who knows the future
Idk about anyone else but i thought the haka this time seemingly lacked the usual intensity, loudness, intimidation factor and didnt seem that fierce. Like the players were not as up for or into it like they usually are. It just seemed kinda off is all. I mean i could tell something was different with the All Blacks right there. Was it nerves on the All Blacks part??, Was it cuz England were just not phased by it and because of said expressions like those in the pic by Farrell and co??.. Its like England had already got inside the heads of the All Blacks or something.


Anyways someone needs to photoshop them "deal with it" shades onto Farrell, that'd complete the pic xD😎.
England's V sign to the haka, fucking genius
The exact opposite of how Ireland looked after the haka last week - Connor Murray looked like he’d filled his nappy. What an exceptional match from England today.
[removed]
He's already seen his opposite number and is thinking "imma kill you, you bastard."
Like a serial killer
Can we make this a custom gold
Anyone got a picture of the England V at the start?
I loved that look so much when I saw it, perfect response to the Haka in my book. 

This picture, that picture of Mako last week, I feel a set of posters coming on
Twin-cam also showing the boner would have been perfect
You look right tasty, lads.
Now THIS is pod racing
That damned smile.
He had a vision of the future right then and there.
So you see, that's where the trouble began.

That smile.

That damn smile
Risky smile of the day
Don’t. That face says you’re going to get a cheeky kidney punch and there won’t be shit you can do to stop it...
Looks like vegeta
The Covington kids have really taken to rugby
It's rather him look at me like this than how he looks at goalposts when kicking
Total look of "I know something you dont".
What a game that was to watch
Not smiling now ya fucking clown
The smirk that says “I love you but I’m about to fuck you in the arse”
Little shit knew something...
Don’t get a man that looks at you the way Farrell looks at the ABs - looks predatory and ready to kill.
Someone needs to add this into that 13 reasons why meme of her talking about the smile
Can’t hate the dude. He saw the future and relished in it.
Like he's about to f@^* you and never call you again?

Go SA! Wipe that sneer off his face! Hope Kolbe is back.
Last time my husband looked at me like that...well.
It’s like he’s seen the future and tongue wagging at him seems so much more humorous.

Its the face when a little kid does something adorable.

A look that says I'm going to steal your girlfriend, what you going to do about it?

these guys were too smart to just do that arrow thing without having a well thought out game plan unlike other teams that tried to do this
I’ve a beautiful wife and two kids, but I agree with this statement.
Off topic but anyone know a method of watching a replay  Of the whole game?
So who is going to flip the smirk upside down for a crying face after the final? My photoshop skills are limited
You can slap a bulls ass while their unaware of your presence only once. It won’t happen again though.  Glad to see the Marc Ellis-Weber trophy remains in the Southern Hemisphere.
Ah the smirk of the man who couldn’t see the springboks coming after the all blacks.
The smirk of a man who thinks he can catch Cheslin

No wonder someone put their hand on his face
OH YEAH!!!!

Oh look,  A Brit who knows he is the bad guy. c:

The title sounds so extremely racist
Scotland fans flew off the handle a bit

A 10 for execution. I found myself reading it out in Mitchell and Webb's voices and everything.
If there’s a moment in life that doesn’t have a perfect Peep Show meme to accompany it, I don’t want to live it. Bravo
The more Peep Show memes the better
This is the best and most perfectly executed shitpost I've seen for weeks

This was a top 5 scene for me for the whole series, so funny
That wasn't very world cuppy.

I feel em but they just want a chance and to be fair, they can totally win. I would be pissed if abs weren't given a shot.

Great meme though 5/7
This is a work of art
Laughed hard
I would rather the storm at this point
Oddly this gif is in fact Numberwang. Well done!
This is especially true when it came to that entirely fabricated Eddie Jones comment. A lot of usually-hidden vile opinions came out in that thread.
Fuckin love Peep Show!
Peep Show is my all time favorite like Office
Top quality meme 👌
This was beautiful.
Peep show will always get an up vote but this is superb
Whenever you get angry like Mark, just think about [little Try-kun](https://ejc.jp/2018/wp-content/themes/jc2018/images/activity/try_kun.jpg). He wouldn't want you to be angry about rugby would he?
Absolutely perfect.

Well played.
OP you are a shitpoet. This is excellent.
Nice
what's the source for the mitchell and webb video?
Theres a peep show reference for anything.

For real though the people that were shouting allegations of match fixing have gone very very quiet now
Spoiler Alert:

Scotland lost, mhahaha
Hahaha amazing. Absolutely love rugby and peep show, so to see the two combined does my soul good.
This is phenomenal! How do we update it after that win by Japan?
This meme works just as good after as it did before the match.
Outstanding
Do we still do the nominate for Tier 3 thing?  This is top quality bantz.
Huh. This was me. Interesting.

This is pure gold lol
You mean like we are putting the home nation out when it's played in England.
Opps that's unsporting, but it's just a world cup joke ( but true)
As funny as this is we should point out it was not Scottish fans saying this but the head of the SRU who is first and foremost a business man and an ENGLISH one at that. Good luck to everyone left in the tournament especially Japan who have been amazing!
