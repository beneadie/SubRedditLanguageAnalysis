This rare image, featuring the victims of the mass slaughter of peaceful protesters by the Chinese army at Tiananmen Square, was just censored from the front page of reddit with 134,000 net upvotes.

[Here are the actual NSFL images the Chinese don’t want you seeing.](https://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/aohpmo/_/eg13byj/?context=1)

Edit: Please stop gilding me, I don’t think we should be throwing money at a company that [accepted $150m from the Chinese](https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/)
Government doesn't want you to see what governments actually do if you push them.
"WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE KIDS AT  TIANANMEN SQUARE??!
You and I have chatted a lot in years past.  You used to be a major high level mod when we talked.  Are you still in upper Reddit?  If so, isn’t this a bad career move?  Just asking why would you not use a throwaway.
what most people don’t know, tiananmen square only saw a tiny fraction of the actual massacre with not nearly hundred injured and (according to amnesty international) no dead. the about 5.000 - 8.000 casualties are distributed across the entirety of beijing

If it's posted literally at least once a week, is it really "rare"?

Could someone please explain to me how is a conspiracy if this pic gets posted all the time without getting removed? The given reason for it's removal was for breaking the post title rules.  It kind of did. Even if it's silly.
The real conspiracy is this post. What if bots are pushing this ant-China agenda. It may be morally right to be against china, but you don't want to be manipulated into doing so AKA russian bots during elections.
I think it was just removed because of its click bait title.
Submission statement; the suppression of this image is, itself, quite the conspiracy in light of continued [state-sponsored investment in reddit by the Chinese firm tencent](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18216134/reddit-tencent-investment-deal-memes-amount-winnie-the-pooh-tank-man-china). However, when one considers the fact that the image itself is not the defining microcosm of the brutality displayed by Chinese state forces in 1989, it becomes clear that such suppression has existed for decades and is not limited only to reddit (or other online sites). 

[Confirmation of the removal from the top of reddit can be found here](https://np.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/ctepmd/tiananmen_square_massacre_picture_gets_deleted/).
"rare"
Comments are currently locked on the front page submission "Censorship Bad" in /r/pics with the mod locking comments stating, "now please, shut up about it."
[deleted]
So censored that everyone saw it and upvoted and commented on it.
hardly rare when it's posted 5 times every month on reddit lmfao
I am so sick of tapping on NSFW posts and having it not be tits and ass.
Jesus you guys are retards. It was removed because it had a shitty title. This picture is not rare, lots of people know about it, the only people who don't know about it are the Chinese and there's nothing we can do about it. So quit this bullshit, you can type in tiananmen massacre and this and thousands of other pictures will be at the top. This gets reposted hourly, it's nonsense.
Corporate America has been covering up for China for decades.

Global capitalists sided with China's government to undermine domestic western workers by using non unionized Chinese workers that never had a labour movement.

As a result, western media censorship has assisted in keeping China's populace under a regime that does this kind of shit to protesters.

China produces a lot of products for American companies so the American companies downplay the treatment because they make money off it.

I personally know someone who was a student there at the time. He said you had to step over other squashed students who were ran over by tanks. He got lucky and ended up in the US. His story was horrific.
This feels astroturfed big time.
[removed]
This isn’t rare.
The image isn’t rare, and it was likely removed because it gets posted at least once a month with the same dramatized “give me karma” title
Posted this 13 weeks ago but nobody cared
This was posted in a slack as an explanation by the mods:

https://i.imgur.com/ETxQJ7G.png

Ok but if that is true then they could have locked the thread, why did they nuke the comment section?

Was talking about this with a person I know who mods many many subs - thats the source of the screenshot.

"WRD" is /r/watchredditdie for the unaware
I used to work with someone who was actually near when that happened. She's now an American citizen, a business owner, and a mother of two extremely bright kids (one should be attending university, if not preparing by now). Her take on it? It's about the same as a lot of other Chinese immigrants I've met: "It's a thing that happened one time."    


Just like some of the aspects of the extremist groups I was raised under, it's very difficult to put things in perspective some time later, when you've grown up indoctrinated that whatever that system of power is, is alright. Even being out from under the oppression I grew up under as a kid, I find myself excusing or trying to explain away things at times.
Yeah China own Reddit
I bet they won’t delete a still from a violent Hollywood movie.
**OK BOYS, BACK TO THE 4CHAN**
I don’t see anything, it’s just an empty road. What are you saying?
It was removed because the title was misleading.  I actually reported it due to violating rules.  If OP would have noted, "This reposted every day picture needs to be seen" that would be one thing, but instead, they used a clickbait title similar to what you are doing to get karma and awards exactly like what you are doing.
So much for that whole "Chinese company investment have no say in censorship" hey /u/spez ya tool
What am I looking at here? If you look closely everyone on the floor is raising their head no one looks dead, there is no blood?
The Chinese company TenCent, who are responsible for blocking Reddit in China, JUST donated a HUGE amount to Reddit.
Throughout the day this post gets more and more upvotes and comments yet it continues to fall down lower on the top rankings. This is truly a scary place #stopchina
come to /r/LateStageCommunism  to battle the tankie conspiracy
With all of the photographs put up, I'm glad that they're being seen by others for the first time. Naturally they'll be further spread across the internet for millions more to see and to learn about.
-20 Social Credit
I wonder why the internet is cutting out randomly
Reddit publicly claimed they were never claimed by China yet their recent actions tells another story. Anway Tencent have deep roots in western companies more than before.
lmao it was literally on the front page
Fuck....
rare image? lol
I'd like to remind everyone that Reddit is privately owned by not you. That means this place ISN'T a free speech haven. They can and do remove legitimate posts all the damn time.
It’s not rare, look up Tiananmen Square massacre victims and it’s the first result
the chinese government murdered the fuck out of those kids... trump's america will do the same...
What slaughter are you talking about? Nothing happened at Tiananmen Square
Good luck Hong kong
god that’s terrifying. both the pictures and the fact that an important moment in human history is being censored because reddit took what is essentially hush money.
Ah, I see the propaganda machine is in full swing.
I found this thread on the front page a minute ago, and now I don't see it there anymore.
Following an "investment" from the Chinese government?
Can't the hong kong protestors get this printed on their shirts, so then the government can no longer look at them, and the chinese police will think they are invisible?
Quit Reddit anyone?
Reddit is Chinese owned so it makes sense.
Gun control is an instrument of government tyranny. This is exhibit A.
The government is not your friend. It is never to be trusted.
Reddit PR comment control Chinese $$$ activate!

Well then, i guess I won't be watching Mulan
If something like Tiananmen happens to these current protestors hopefully the world doesn’t sit on its hands.
Thank Bush Sr/Bill Clinton/Walmart for killing US jobs so China could build up even stronger, buy up the world with cash offers & bring even more censorship to the land of FREEDUMB !!!!
So is Reddit actually censoring these posts? Have they been asked about it?
That was like 40 years ago why are they still trying to cover it up
Fuck censorship!!!
Screenshotted so no one can take this powerful image away from anyone.
Took a screenshot for my own reference. I've never seen that before.
Now why the fuck would they ever do that? not like the chinese are free enough to be allowed on reddit anyway right? 

110 million dollares buys a lot of lemon dicking, it seems

all hail the lemon emperor and his golden censorship
Reddit was bought by China so I’m not surprised 🤷🏼‍♂️ our CEO St3ve Huffm@n is a snake!
Imagining witnessing that horror
I see it on top of the front page.
Is it rare if I've seen it before?
Russia : we're the best at dealing with dissent
China : hold my noodle
Proof reddit has become part of the matrix.
This never happened. Stop posting photoshops you will destroy this sub!
bruh this gets posted every year and it's always the same line "ThEy aRe CeNsoRiNg ThIs PhoTo!!" when in reality it's not. Maybe the post you're talking about was breaking some rule
This is what happens when governments have too much power. America is not immune. People would gladly sell their souls if it meant they got free healthcare. They would let police do anything if it meant normal citizens couldn’t get their hands on those _scary_ guns. Even though the black market will happily sell anyone a gun anyway. Including crazed terrorists.
Everyone cries out for the victims of the nazis yet have no problem doing business with and treating as an ally the CCP responsible for this atrocity among many atrocities
It wasn't censored, it was deleted because the title was really misleading by calling it a "hard to find image" (just like you are doing by saying "this rare image) this photo is one of the easiest images to find when you look up Tiananmen, in fact it's the very first result when looking up "Tiananmen square massacre" and the 7th when looking up "Tiananmen aftermath"

You know why? Because they didnt have misleading titles like yours and the one your referencing.
It is night now and clicking this was not a good idea
Anyone else have system of a down playing in thier head now?
Went to China in 2017. I was still in school and had no idea what Tiananmen Square was but my older sister thought it was a “museum” and we tried to go to the forbidden city two seperate times because we were genuinely confused as to what this place was. 

You’re actually not allowed to see the forbidden city and surrounding the whole thing are military who scare you and tell you can’t take photos, videos, etc. Complete censorship .
I also noticed that r/chinesetourists was removed from Reddit, yet r/whitetourists wasn't.
It’s so funny that this is the top post in this sub. First of all, literally just zoom in. The majority of those silhouettes are clearly bicycles. The rest are people obviously dropping for cover, but you can see that their heads are still propped up. You all claim that the Western media is propaganda, but believe everything it tells you about China ? Remember Iraq and it’s WMD ? Y’all really dense huh
Amogus
This is where the US is heading.
Welcome to The United States of Chimerica.
Tencent, the company responsiblr for The Great Firewall of China is now reddit's biggest investor. 

I would expect to see much, much more pro-chinesse manipulation in the future.
Screenshot because Reddit sold out to Chinese censorship company

China sucks dogs buttholes, people always talk about Hitler but what about that fat Winnie the other Pooh Mao ZeFatfuck the dude was an utter nut job and killed upward of 40+ million?
It was supposedly removed for violating /r/pics's 4th rule regarding "Title Guidelines". These are those guidelines:

> 1. No asking for votes, direct or indirect. (examples: "never forget", "people sorting by new", "this needs more exposure", "this is what people should be posting")

> 2. Must not ask for general information, assistance, or feedback. Try r/whatisthisthing or r/assistance. (examples: "what do you see?", "what does reddit think about...?", "how can I improve?")

> 3. No emoji-only titles.

> 4. Must convey accurate information.

> 5. Must not be about cake day.

> 6. Must not be addressed to other redditors.

> 7. No memorial posts.

> 8. No "stock photos"- Primarily reserved for public figures, and historical/trending photos/events. Keep in mind, history can happen in a day.

> 9. No sharing works on behalf of friends & family (unless they are included in the photo.)

> 10. All elements of title-based backstories must somehow relate to the content of the image.
That photo has bullets flying through the air. You can see the group to the left taking cover from the assault, and those cyclists are pedaling for their lives. Also see the person taking cover in the upper right corver hiding behind a tiny amount of cover, I doubt he made it out.
It wasn't because I saw it a few posts above this one on /all

You guys love to say stuff was removed / censored when it never was.

Newsflash; China doesn't give a flying fuck what we do on reddit.  If they did, this sub and many others like it would not exist.
Or maybe it's because you are using it as propaganda.
I was banned from /r/worldnews for supporting someone posting information about the Tiananmen Square massacre in Chinese. Not for posting it myself even, for *supporting* someone posting it, vehemently.

Appealed the ban on the grounds that none of /r/worldnews's rules were broken. No response. Assumed it must be because the mod that banned me ignored the request and deleted it. A week later during peak hours when I confirmed multiple mods were on, I appealed the ban again. Again, no response.

I don't have anything else to say about it, just thought it was relevant here.
This is what ANTIFA should be protesting...
China, best disguised tyranny in the world.
Because the Communists bought control here and is about to commit another atrocity 1000s of magnitudes greater in Hong Kong and they can't have people remembering the last to compare it too.
Tencent gonna Tencent.

unpopular opinion: what did they expect? did they think that the Chinese government, which not 20 years earlier had conducted mass "re-education" during the Cultural Revolution, was going to treat them fairly? Does the West seriously think that China will not do the same thing again in order to keep itself from dealing with the issues associated with free political speech? Cmon now, that's being naive. I'm not saying it's acceptable by Western democratic standards but by the standards of Asian governments, historically, it is par for the course. Stopped being shocked by this and stop trying to shock people with it- it is not shocking nor is it a revelation. It is normal tbh- the thing that would be out of character for China would be to tolerate and come to terms with dissenters. Anyway, if you are shocked by this then you honestly aren't paying attention to history because it isn't the first nor the last time a situation like this will take place in Asia. If it isn't China it is KSA. If it isn't KSA it is Syria. If it isn't Syria it is Turkey. It it isn't Turkey it is Russia. If it isn't Russia it is North Korea. If it isn't North Korea then it is Myanmar. If it isn't Myanmar it is India and Pakistan. If it isn't India and Pakistan it is Israel and Iran. If it isn't Israel and Iran it is Afghanistan or some warlord in the stans. It's a fucking clusterfuck there with a long history of tribalism, violence and advancement based off of political affiliation. You're better off just accepting that the conflicts there will probably have violent ends and acting based on that premise from the start as I'm presuming the well-prepared Hong Kong protestors have. If the Chinese military is foolish enough to implement what I think they will implement (media blackout, marshal law, evacuations and nighttime raids) then I believe the protestors have come up with ideas on how to counter that since it is so likely to happen. That said, short of having their own air support and nuclear weapon, they will still likely lose and in bloody fashion.

This reminds me of the novel, 1984 by George Orwell. Through, lies, deceit and 'reassurance', to the point of incessant repetition, the minds of the masses are easily disarmed. Thinking the threat to be the opposition to the status -quo, rather than seeing the status-quo for what it is; evil.

The Youtube video has over a million views in less than 24 hours and it's not trending at all.
Its far more than sinclair people... All non independent news sources are corporate and government controlled. They decide how you think so its beneficial for them.
>"This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"

In more ways than one.
[This post should](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/?ref=share&ref_source=link) be on the best of all time on /r/All  it has over 116 k votes

This is extremely dangerous for our democracy
So glad to see a conspiracy post with double gold and trending! 
So who owns Sinclair politically?
This is not on the front page right now? That’s a bit strange.
What the absolute fuck
This shit speaks for itself
This has 3 times as many upvotes than anything on my newsfeed yet this is no longer on the front page. Maybe idk how this all works but I feel like it should stay on top??
The conspiracy nuts are starting to seem a little too reasonable
This is terrifying
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
I can almost guarantee you all these “news journalist” also have no idea they are all repeating the same persons agenda. compartmentalization at its finest.
I never stopped loving this post
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy

I hope the people in this sub realize these are all right-wing news stations owned by a right-wing corporation serving a right-wing government.
But muh liberal media!!! FOH. The media ain't fucking liberal if you think that you're blind or brainwashed. Media protects corporate interests, and the republican party protects corporate interests far more strongly than the democrats do. The idea that the media has a liberal bias is absolute insanity.
It is filling 4 of the top 25 slots on my /r/all at the moment.  Something tells me if Reddit was trying to suppress it that would not be the case.   
This video is #1 of /r/all currently, although the thread is locked. Top of /r/politics as well.
If you switch channels between each of your local news stations (ABC/CBS/FOX), they all seem to have the same stories being played at roughly the same time. 
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
..whoa.. wtf? 
One world order much? 
You're watching the Streisand Effect take place in real time
 
How delightful 
>Sinclair, the largest owner of local television stations in the country, is awaiting approval for its proposed merger with Tribune Media, which would give it access to about 70 percent of the nation’s television audience.
[deleted]
Can we just talk about how Sinclair has had a pretty major influence on broadcast regulation for some time now, and how this is just a recent very blatant example of the control they have over broadcast? Not necessarily thought police, but definitely been doing some thought regulating.

Hell look at the net neutrality debate, made it pretty clear that the debate has always been about FAST LANES and possibly getting SUPER SLOW YOUTUBE VIDEOS right? /s edit - (almost forgot that part)
Get ready.  This is in preparation for Trump's move on Mueller.
I know no one will see this. And I'm happy about it.  I realize I'm just adding a drop to the bucket, and it fills me with happiness. Propaganda has been legal for a few years now, and people can see it with their own eyes. This is a great day. I only hope we can build on this momentum and keep striving towards a better future. I'm hoping for  but not counting on  the human race. Please don't let is down.  We have  no where else to go.
 

Holy shit, I don't buy into a lot of conspiracy theories, but this one is impossible to deny. It's terrifying.
Wow you don’t realize how non-human news anchors really speak until you hear it over and over again. 
[deleted]
Keeeep spreadinggg the .1 % are loosing control.
Everyone of these news readers is an asshole.
Yeah, I saw one of these this past week, and it made me sick.
We don't have a free or open media.
Somebody better save/mirror this video before YouTube takes it down 
And that's why you don't trust the media no matter which political side you're standing left /right just fuck the press there trying to make us fight against each other ...just let everyone have their own opinion and be peaceful to each other 
Wow.... News anchors really are just cue-card-reading parrots?! How did they coordinate this?! If they can unilaterally push this crappy dialogue about democracy over a quiet weekend, imagine how much they work together on a regular Mon-Fri news week to sensationalize stories for each of the angles they're paid to read
I’ve never seen anything like this. 51k upvotes in THIS sub? Idk if I’ll ever trust/watch local news again, 
This was pointed out (and made fun of) by Conan O’Brien. I’m not surprised that someone or something has control and say on what’s being shown as “news” - we need to be diligent and watch other newscasts outside of the US to get the whole story. 
It got deleted/removed from front page again
Cnn is talking about it on the news right now. Didn't really watch the segment but they definitely acknowledged the video.  Couldn't watch it because I'm working but saw it on a patients TV. I'm curious to what they said about it. 
Reminds me of "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
I posted it on Facebook and it dropped immediately so far I never found it. 
Conan did a bit on this years ago. It did not get as popular.
what the hell
Capitalism is bad!
They're fucking with the comments too.  At the bottom of the first page, it shows 2180 comments left to be shown.  I click to show more and it loads one page only with no other links to show more.  It certainly did not load all 2180 some odd comments in the second page.

No other option to see what people are saying.

This is fucked, I should at least be able to see what people are saying.
I just showed this video to my brother, he went to post it to Facebook, and his account got locked saying there’s suspicious activity. I am trying to post this comment as many times as I can to share this. I deleted my facebook but am asking others to verify this because Facebook is a part of it now. 
One world order much? 
this is extremely dangerous to our democraZy. 
tHiS iS eXtrEMeLy DaNGeROuS tO oUr DeMOcRacy
this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
This is creepy
We need to understand and realize the MSM and our corporate overlords can not be trusted.  It’s all narrative and lies for whatever purpose they want us to believe.  Right now the narrative is we need to go to war against Russia.  Critical thinking people.  At the least, know you are being lied to if you watch and listen to the MSM.  I unplugged years ago.
Look up operation mockingbird. This all seems almost too hard to believe.
Who is that sinclair ?
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
Woah I didn't realize this 4 years ago
Operation Mockingbird?
My jaw is dropped
Lol America is so fucked
This was reported on about a month ago when the script was given to news stations.  It's very concerning and pretty interesting the detail they go into pushing this script.

> CNN reports instructions accompanying the promo script direct anchors to read the scripts “exactly as they are written.” Local stations are also instructed to run the promos as frequently as possible “to create maximum reach and frequency,” and are told to run the promos “using news time, not commercial time.”

> The instructions for the promos also direct anchors to dress in “jewel tones” and avoid the colors red, blue and purple.

> “The goal is to look apolitical, neutral, nonpartisan yet professional,” the instructions read, according to CNN.

> One anchor at a Sinclair station, who spoke to CNN anonymously, said “everyone” at their local station was “uncomfortable” with the promo.


http://thehill.com/homenews/media/377296-sinclair-requiring-anchors-to-read-new-promo-slamming-one-sided-news-stories
This is why we don't trust the Mainstream media anymore.

ABC, NBC, FOX, they're all part of the same face.
Not sure why people are surprised by this. John Oliver did a segment on this last year where he put all segments side by side, showing how they were all saying the same thing.
Crazy how close we are to Communist China in these matters. 
[Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)

As you can see there's nothing new about this.
Does r/conspiracy not realize Sinclair Broadcasting is a Trump ally? 
And it will be deleted from this sub because it has been taken over by Trump supporters.

They want this. They want every news station reading pro-Trump scripts.

If you guys really want to get to the bottom of a legitimate conspiracy affecting all of our lives right now, start here.

Put down the pizza.
We must do **everything** we can to preserve this, and make sure as many people as possible see it.

Once again proves that the USA is brainwashing their people just as bad as other countries they blame for doing so.
This is an absolute hit against the establishment. Thank god the average Joe can understand how one sided the ‘mainstream' is
No it wasn't deleted, it on r/all first page on 3 subreddits, this, videos and television.
Anyone Who still watch mainstream media in 2018 is a fucking ignorant by choice.
We now return you to your regularly scheduled mind programming 
It's literally plastered all over the front page lol what are you talking about
Umm new black mirror ad campaign maybe? Like wot is going on America ? 
Bookmaark
Someone download this vid right now 
from what subreddits were they deleted/what was the context of their deletion? 
This needs to be upvoted where ever its posted in reddit, Have it cover every slot of the front page. 
Fuck Sinclair.
holy shit
Hey, conspiracy made it to the front page! I should make a post about this in /r/conspiracy... oh wait...
No it wasn't. 
The real conspiracy here is the fact that this video is blowing up on april fools day, sewing its own doubt.
It’s got 160k upvotes in /r/videos though...
It baffles me people still watch the news on tv. It’s nothing but pure sensationalism. 
And this is why i dont watch news, read news papers or follow news of any kind. 
Since unfollowing groups and most people on facebook, unsubscribing to news groups on reddit my life has become alot better too.
I am very guilty of expressing my views on social media, I cant change what i have done but i can make sure i never do it again.
Just because we have opinions does not mean we should share them.
Turn that shit off, get a hobby or do something that interests you.
And dont forget to be nice to people :)
But muh fake news
When you listen to them all at the same time it sounds like satanic chant. 
This is the top post in r/videos, television, and now here...it wasn't deleted it just fell off the front page from what I can tell. 
I’m so glad I don’t have cable 
Oh god now /r/me_irl is going to make a meme out of 'extremely dangerous to our democracy'.
OK it's shitty if this has been getting deleted on various platforms but I wish there was less outrage about the censorship and more outrage about the actual video and its implications.
It was just deleted again from the front page...
Im not american. Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks
Alright this is enough Internet today. I’m freaked the fuck out now
Can somebody tell me how to link just to another subreddit my local news station was in the video and our city has a subreddit called r/Rochester ..I want to see what everyone else form my area thinks about this
MESSAGE TO THE MAINSTREAM - WE DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR BULLSHIT ANYMORE!!! YOU'RE DONE!!
Reddit is compromised.
Thank god I gave up news channels, Reddit is the best place for unbiased news. 
"Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what you think." Thanks for the heads up, I'll keep an eye out for them
REMINDER: It has been 2866 days since Sean Hannity offered to undergo waterboarding for charity as proof that it's not torture and has not done it.

I don't mind at all that people won't let this die. The guy ran his mouth and gets what he deserves.
Waterboarding is definitely torture. Even volunteering to be waterboarded for a short demonstration sucked - being interrogated against my will? Pass.
People say that waterboarding is torture because it simulates the feeling of drowning, but it doesn't. You're literally being drowned. You can't breathe through a wet cloth. They just pull the cloth off before you end up getting hurt.
...if it's not torture that what would be the point of the method? 
Water boarding is torture. There's no getting around that fact.
Steven crowder did it
https://youtu.be/hBu93TroNTU
Mancow took the offer and said it was torture. But he has a libertarian view more centrist than Hannity that leans more right. 
Good thing I decided not to hold MY breath for him to do it.
Is it a conspiracy that this is #2 on all?
[deleted]
This is totally a conspiracy. 
I hate hannity as much as the next guy, but this is not a conspiracy.
[deleted]
how is this a conspiracy 
Why is this in r/conspiracy ?
Steven crowder did it in December and laughed the whole time 
Why the fuck is this on /r/conspiracy ?
How is this a conspiracy?
i'm glad that biased reddit modding and algorithms have chosen to put this on the front page.

a completely off topic, clearly politically motivated post. that fits the anti-trump, anti-republican agenda pursued by reddit management for soro's ad money. 
How is this a conspiracy? 

"Man doesn't do thing man said he would do"

There's no conspiracy, there's no speculation, there's no controversy over what happened
Waterboarding is torture.

Hannity is establishment propaganda pusher.

How is this a conspiracy?
This non-conspiratorial post has 22.3k upvotes in /r/conspiracy and "someone" gave it gold.. 

Lol yeah, this is a real organic post....
This doesn't belong here. 
And that's a conspiracy? 
Why is this in this sub?
[deleted]
Wow.. this post is sure to get a democrat elected. 
How is this a conspiracy? 
This isn't a conspiracy.
This isn't a conspiracy lol
One of the local shock jocks on the radio here didn't think it was torture and offered to try it. He changed his mind real quick and said it was a horrible experience. 
Pure trash. Up vote manipulation. Nothing to do with a conspiracy.


Ah reddit manipulation of subreddits.  The real conspiracy
Why is this so popular?
how is this a conspiracy?  
Where is the conspiracy?
This has fucking *nothing* to do with conspiracy.
This isn't a conspiracy. This is just someone being an asshole. 
this isn't a conspiracy you lunatics...stop posting off topic crap
Lol, hi shareblue!

ITT: Butthurt cultist partisans going "waaaaaaaaa, why is this in /r/conspiracy?"
Why is this subreddit being inundated with posts that have nothing to do with conspiracies? Looks like the shills have taken over this sub as well. Thanks Soros.
Why isn't the MSM reporting on this?

^^^itsaconspiracy
The fact that this of all posts is so upvoted makes me really consider getting out of this sub. In no world is this a conspiracy. Honestly it's embarrassing 
Why the fuck is this on conspiracy lol?  Can you guys just keep this in your r/politics, r/worldnews, r/TIL, etc. Jesus how much longer until the shill $ runs out. 
It's 100 days since Miley Cyrus said she'd leave America if Trump won.
I love the fact this completely non-conspiracy related post in /r/conspiracy was guilded.
That’s a long time. I think he qualifies for the diarrheaboarding upgrade.
ok I get it, he's a flag waving coward that gets paid to talk on TV. But how is this related to a conspiracy theory?
shariablue is finally brigading this sub i see
I subbed here 4 days ago because I thought we would be discussing top secret conspiracies like aliens. So far it's just been Republican hate. 
Not worthy of a conspiracy post on r/conspiracy 
the amount of paid shilling on this website has become simply disgusting 
The fuck is the conspiracy?  Did he lie?  Yes, sure.  Conspiracy?  Can someone help me find it?

I see some of you bitch about getting taken over by TD.  Seems like it's the opposite and sharia blue has found you.
christopher hitchens thought waterboarding wasn't torture either https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LPubUCJv58
Guess what ShareBlue? Its been about 2866 days since anyone gave a shit. 

LITERALLY 7.8 YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED. 

HOLY SHIT. HOLY SHIT PEOPLE. Do you have any idea what this means? 

Nothing. Its not even a conspiracy. 
Notice how when there's an article that hurts the left, Obama, Hillary, or even slightly makes Trump look human, these comments come out in full force to mock this sub and say T_D is taking over or call it conservative conspiracy theory.

Yet strangely whenever there's an article on here that hurts the right, Bush, or Trump it's heavily upvoted and all top comments are talking about the topic at hand.

Obvious /r/politics brigade is obvious
Crowder did it in December. https://youtu.be/UpdhwM_hnAA
Tried it, its horrible, wouldn't wish it upon anyone. And torture is not an effective way of getting accurate information.
Conspiracy? 
This just became the highest post on this sub of all time. And it's not even close. Looks like the hounds got released.
How is this a conspiracy?
Shit I'll do it for charity someone strap me up
Torture is bad and this is /r/conspiracy how? 
Hitchens did it.  Lasted 20 seconds.  RIP Chris.  Integrity died with him.
I assume he still hasn’t done it.
Lol are we being serious with this.  Who cares
So many people asking why in the fuck is this considered a conspiracy yet it has 13,000 fake upvotes and gilded with only 505 comments.

The real conspiracy is how an anti-Trump admin can tack on tens of thousands of upvotes on all the anti-Trump articles so their political opinion is shoved in our faces all day every day. 

the amount of paid shilling  and political brigade on this website has become simply disgusting


I don't care about hannity, but a conspiracy page must have posts about well..... god damned conspiracies, not political hack jobs .
I am an imaginative sort of guy and want to see conspiracy theory discussions about fascinating stuff and what I get is constant political BS. People have equated conspiracy theory to alternate politics( Non main stream politics), it goes far beyond that, even far beyond humanity itself. Where are my damn lizards???
Lol. They think we can't tell when something is inorganically slingshotted to #1. 
Torture that doesn't result in maiming or death.
What does this have to do with conspiracies? This subreddit has changed. 
[Steven Crowder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpdhwM_hnAA) was waterboarded in December by Army Ranger Tim Kennedy. He had it done to him many times and concluded that it was psychological torture but not physical. 
[deleted]
I'm a lurker but anyone got a new subreddit for actual conspiracies? There is no conspiracy here - it's a fact and this post is being brigaded. This subreddit has changed a ton since the popular introduction.
Hannity is definitely a moron, but how is this a conspiracy?
How in the absolute fuck did this receive 32k+ upvotes?  WTF is going on, reddit?
Is there a video of him saying it? Did he ever address him not carrying it through with his promise?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhRxXAQ0QQ
How is this a conspiracy? I guess my question from earlier is answered.
Amy shumer also said she'd move to Canada if trump won and hasn't done so. 
Steven Crowder did it and asked for seconds
This would have been prime material for Christopher Hitchens. This would be a great decade for him. 
What does it have to do with conspiracy? 
Congrats! your post is in the top 10 of the day on all.
[deleted]
so who cares maybe he wasn't being literal big whoop and Rachel Maddow claims she's a woman what's the difference they're just comedians 
Funny how someone can get away with such an ignoramus statement.
Public icons are full of shit, no conspiracy here lol. How many said they'd leave if Trump got elected or when Obama got elected, it's not a conspiracy that people are full of shit. Heck I'm full of shit and I'm sure most of y'all are too....
What conspiracy is this?
Aaaaaand there goes r/conspiracy
So he's a pussy that writes checks with his mouth that he's not willing to cash...
He has that face that you want to punch until you dislocate your shoulder.
Maybe saw that Christopher Hitchens Video.... Bless his soul, braver than any of these Fox news reporters.
Even if saying that is retarded and he is by no means the first idiot to say that waterboarding is not bad or the first to be volunteer for it. Hell, there is an Archer episode about it too.

This is in no shape or form a conspiracy.

Then people say this sub doesn't get brigaded by shills.
Guy has a bomb and your family at a location only he knows. You have 2 minutes. What else do you do? Ask him politely?
I'll do it. I think it would be awful and think it is a form of torture, but would do it. I will not have a car battery strapped to my balls and zapped though, that just doesn't work for me. 
There have been plenty of people who did this to prove this exact point. Most notably [Mancow](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qUkj9pjx3H0) and [Christopher Hitchens](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Efh_6_-tHgY) let me just say it's much worse than it looks. Holding your breath doesn't help. 
He also offered free airfare to all of the asshole Hollywood libtards out of this Country like they all said they would, and not ONE has taken him up on it!
I'm a Hannity fan and I think he should follow through! Christopher Hitchens put his money where his mouth was and got waterboarded as an experiment. In a later interview he said the experience convinced him it absolutely *is* torture. 
Man Cow got waterboarded to prove it was not torture. After he was waterboarded he said he would admit to anything just make it stop. And it is definitely torture.
lol of course waterboarding is torture. Why the fuck do you think they do it. That was such a stupid argument. 
Sean Hannity is a cunt.
The physical experience during waterboarding doesn't really matter.  If you're doing something to someone with the hopes that they'll exchange information to get you to stop, that something is torture.  It's ridiculous that we're even making alternate arguments. 
Someone needs a gofundme account specifically to waterboard sean hannity for a minute. I've been waterboarded and a handful of my friends all did as well. 10 seconds in, you felt like you were incapable of breathing. It. Is. Terrible.


What's the conspiracy 
Keep the attention on him. He makes fantastic points against being a brain dead liberal. 
How is this a conspiracy....
Not a conspiracy you losers
You guys need to focus on more productive things lol
Hannity annoys the shit out of me.  All he does is repeat the same bullshit for years.  
How is this a conspiracy 
We still don't have Hillarys 30000 deleted emails. Just saying!
Is anyone surprised?
Like big bad ted Nugent.

He's a badass hunter, until his "prey" shoots back.

Guys like Shaun are the same insulated cowards projecting their bravery from thousands of miles away.

He's a cunt.
How is this a conspiracy? Is it a conspiracy that all the cunts who promised to move if Trump won doesn't follow through? No. 
How does something this ridiculous get honed in on as some gotcha moment?  Does anybody really think this was some sort of legitimate commitment?
Reminder: 80 days ago a Billionaire pedophile, connected with every elite member, who owned his own island with underage sex slaves, killed himself before he was to testify. He was on suicide watch and killed himself by hanging on his knees. Don’t ever forget, those responsible are free.

Not just an island, but a ranch in New Mexico (un-raided)

 Not just suicide, suicide in the same prison El Chapo was kept ON SURVEILLANCE. 

Both guards were asleep apparently, then and or removed at the time, they can’t get their story straight.

Cell mate removed prior to.

Screaming or yelling heard prior to him hanging *himself*?

Cameras malfunctioned.

But really he just escaped earlier via body double replacing him. Who by the way has none of the same features except for similar skin tone and hair color. 

You think this dude this powerful didn’t have a escape plan, a plan B? You think any of this went as reported? All a rouse. Fall guy didn’t even have to fall.

This was the plan all along. Tensions rising due to Weinstein getting called out, cracks in their pedo fortress begin to leak bits and pieces of truth.

Get someone SUPER important, visibly send him to jail, make it seem the pedo world is built on his shoulders, have him kill himself before trial.

Nails in the coffin, media silence, gets off Scott free.

Edit:  updated the part about him screaming or yelling prior to him hanging *himself*.

EDIT:  ALL the sources below, minus all the things I didn’t even bring up here.
Anybody curious what the island looks like on the ground??

Luke Rudkowski from “We are Change” actually went there and posted this video yesterday... Watch it before they take it down!!

https://youtu.be/VmgSM7lWRts
Dont forget the missing cellmate, the busted security camera and shady guard detail. Oh and the broken bones in his neck. Face it America is mostly brainwashed to the point of no return.
He didn’t kill himself
> On Tuesday [**the New York Times reported**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-jail-officers.html) that guards in the Special Housing Unit had allegedly fallen asleep on the night of Epstein's death. 

you know what's hilarious about this? I've worked a good amount of night shift jobs in my adult life. most of my jobs have been night shift.. you don't fall asleep because it's night. you acclimate really easy to a night shift job. it's like its just simple enough for a normie to understand... oh it happened at night so the night shift guards fell asleep because it was night... that's such horseshit... there were two guards, they wouldn't have fallen asleep together at any rate.. if it were some sort of situation where someone magically fell asleep they wouldn't have both fallen asleep. two nightshift guards in the same section of the jail fell asleep, and it just so happened to be the same night epstein decided to kill himself...  

also of course the fact he was found on the ground.. but night shift people aren't dosing off every night like in the cartoons
SS: 

Never forget, those responsible are free.

Edit: Epstein didn’t kill himself.
He’s about as dead as you and I. You know he’s on an island somewhere. Body double got killed. Or they waited until they found a suitable stiff in the morgue to put in his place. As set up from the word go.
This guy is still alive somewhere. Him with his egg shaped penis.
Ayyyy /r/conspiracy reaching the front page with 94%?  Nice.
he’s still alive
Epstein didn't kill himself.  He's still alive.  There were reports of unregistered transport vans coming in and out of the prison around the time of his "death," and the body that was taken from his cell was said to not even be him.  The man who did Epstein's autopsy was the same who did JFK and MLK.  This is a coverup.  Epstein was broken out of prison and is still alive.
[deleted]
My hot take

The CIA has been using Epstein to get blackmail for a long time. Trump came in and decided to stop the program. None of it can ever come to light however, because it would damage the US and allies too badly. So Epstein had to die, and the upper levels of our government know.
Look I just gotta say it. I used to work in a state prison. Not gonna name it. "Alcatraz of the South" I worked suicide watch before. Theres one way in and one way out. If anything happened, more than 1 person had to go along with it. Its frustrating knowing this scenario is impossible. Period. It would not happen, where I worked anyway. Perspective from a former member of the corrections union. Noped out of there as soon as I saw the bigger picture.
#Not on suicide watch. 

Epstein's lawyer argued that he was attacked by his cell mate, [Nicholas Tartaglione](https://nypost.com/2019/09/23/ex-cop-accused-of-hurting-jeffrey-epstein-killed-a-guy-with-zip-ties-feds/),  a former New York police officer who was arrested in December 2016 on charges of killing four men in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, was sharing a cell with Epstein in Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center at the time Epstein was found semiconscious in the fetal position with marks on his neck.  

#[Jeffery Epstein's former cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione requests move from MCC, alleging threats from prison guards](https://6abc.com/epsteins-former-cellmate-alleges-threats-from-prison-guards/5481525/)  (August 21, 2019)   
>In a letter to the court, Tartaglione's attorney alleged that correction officers know his client has information "potentially very damaging" to the staff at MCC. 

>He wrote that guards at the facility have told him to "shut up," "stop talking" and "stop complaining."
-
>"The clear message Mr. Tartaglione has received is that if he conveys information about the facility or about the recent suicide, there will be a price to pay," his attorney, Bruce Barket, wrote the judge. "The continuing and seemingly unresolvable problems with the conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's confinement coupled with the unfortunate attempted suicide by a cellmate, to which Mr. Tartaglione is a critical witness, and the successful suicide of that same person makes his continued detention at the MCC inappropriate."

Edit: a more appropriate ending quote.
I’m not even a conspiracy theorist (so maybe I shouldn’t be posting around here), but to me this is hardly even conspiracy. It’s so fucking obvious that this is all wrong. Honestly, who just would fucking look at this whole story and be like, “Checks out to me!” Oh right. Voters. Touché.
[deleted]
Don't forget AG William Barr was in charge of his security
I guarantee his pedo buddies pulled him out of there, surgically reconstructed his face and he’s back on a new island w more victims. Sick world.
Pretty sure he’s still alive. Wasn’t it on 4chan or somewhere, a picture of someone who’s clearly him? Regardless if a photo exists though he’s definitely not dead.
This should still be story of the century so far, and the complete silence from the media should be enough evidence by itself for even people who don't follow conspiracies that mainstream news is as real as chinese state news.
1) Those responsible are free.

2) Those responsible knew it would look highly suspicious, nonetheless *for reasons known only to them* they determined that the trouble of suspicion was worth avoiding charges coming to light.  To put another way, what they're hiding is bad enough to go sloppy with his assassination.  They needed him dead ASAP, not a moment later.
Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.
Yo I appreciate all the memes keeping this going but also wtf am I supposed to do with this knowledge. I'm not Batman.
What's the logo on his shirt?
The people responsible are the people in power.
I think most conspiracy theories are ridiculous. But this shit is serious.
Where are all the documents from Giuffre v. Maxwell that were supposed to contain all the names?

Release those now, unredacted!

We aren't even talking about those docs anymore. Getting these docs and names out is more important than who killed the guy.
He looks like a douche that has actual conversations with 16 year olds.  r/hittablefaces
Epstein is alive. Thanks for believing what the pedophiles want you to believe.
/r/punchablefaces
*“The Clintons send their regards.”*
Thank you, OP.

Not because I want Justice for the subhuman Epstein.

I want justice for the victims of every Pedo who ever lived.
This story is as dead as Epstein. And that’s the way they want it.
I can't imagine we will ever know how epstein died or who killed him.

The guy had his finger in so many pies it didn't matter what country, political spectrum, gender, age, race or job you had. Literally every person that guy met had enough power and influence to have this done without ever being found out.

Terrifying really.
The girl in the back, way back, what’s going on with her hand?
He didnt kill himself. He was silenced.
I don’t think anyone here knows how violent prisons can be they are rural and injured must be airlifted so the guards come from all black or all white hillbillies who never encounter other races and prison is a private industry not a federal institution if you go to prison in Florida they torture you and you will see people murdered gurenteed.. to survive in Florida prison u gotta be willing to kill they kill people for ramen noodles and torture for fun same with the guards they even allow inmates to fight or leave inmates alone while they smoke. We call our prisons gladiator school and there is no protective custody so if locked up here he would still be dead... so no matter what someone was gonna kill him and torture him. I believe he is dead so there won’t be a trial exposing others cuz he would take a plea being a spoiled brat and rat on all of them he was like JFK a threat to the elite members of society. Don’t forget this is and never was a democracy.
Just watch steven crowders youtube video of his reenactment and you will see that its actually scientifically more probable that he was murdered based upon his injuries found during his autopsy.
He’s alive and well in Israel

Remember folks, /r/conspiracy keeps you feeling apathetic and hopeless.

No one has been brought to justice for Daphne Caruana Galizia's assassination, and no one is being tried for the crime.
The lady behind him has a shirt that says “don’t”

“Killed himself”
When does the revolution begin?
If people think a highly connected billionaire killed himself they are delusional
this dude is still alive don't think otherwise. He's too powerful to be left alone to die in a cell.
Before he was to testify? Hmmmm
Epstein didnt kill himself. Thats the conspiracy.
If Jimmy Saville can get away with murder-raping 1000 kids, our Kings can get away with anything. The kings are too powerful with too many contingencies.
Those who are responsible, will NEVER be caught for this.
Epstein didn't kill himself
He didn't fucking kill himself, he was fucking murdered to keep him quiet.  


Quit affirming what is obviously a bunch of fucking bullshit.      


go try and drown yourself.   You cant.  your brain will not allow you to if there is a way out, and he would have simply had to get up off his knees, or pull himself up to prevent it - he was strangled to death by the giant 4 time murdering ex cop they made his cell mate - something that doesn't happen when you're such a high profile prisoner, you get kept in solitary or in your own cell.  


this dude was murdered so people like the royal family, the Clintons, and trump could keep him from squacking in court and blowing the lid on all the fucked up bullshit that the elites of this country and many others have been doing.  


STOP.   Call this shit what is is!   a fucking cover up!
Assuming he is actually dead and the whole thing wasn't just a big cover up.
Just to clarify, he was not on suicide watch as it was removed the day prior. That alone raises questions but it's an important distinction to tell the truth.
Who? No name in title..
He didn't kill himself.... I don't believe it one bit
I found it interesting listening to the last Epstein podcast that El Chapo’s lawyers were in the room when he signed all his money over to a trust with undisclosed benefactors the day before he died. Hmmmmm
He wasn’t a billionaire
Put the cheetos down and hit the streets.
Meh, people want to rail the government about how incompetent it is and when an example of just how incompetent it is occurs people don’t believe and want to cry conspiracy.
Also don’t forget he’s more than likely alive and well continuing his business
We just happened to be asleep while the cameras were not working as well etc. What a fucking coinky dink.
I wonder how these guys are communicating.  I wonder if he was aware of something more advanced..

This is what the media should be focused on... we need the truth
Justice, one of the many words that doesn't exist in elites world.
how was this already 80 days ago. wtf?
Epstein is not dead. Why would the elite kill a friend they've had for decades? Think Epstein would sell out his elite friends? He knows the consequences they bailed him out.
Ever since someone pointed out that he never shows his teeth I really notice it now. There's one pic with his teeth and they look tiny and like there's too many in his mouth.
Follow @firebiden on Insta. Big unveiling tmrw 😉 🤝
unpopular opinion, child rapists and child abusers are often beat up and or killed in prison, and his cellmate was a massive man capable of killing him.  guards also like to take off when assholes are getting beaten
He is living in South America somewhere - there is no evidence he is dead. Conveniently missing surveillance video, less than believable coroners report, inexcusable lack of procedures in the prison that would never have happened in real life.  There is no way he is dead.

I can't believe it's been that long already. The average person 100% has forgotten. The government successfully and quickly made sure of that with all manner of distractions.

Epstein did not kill himself. Don’t believe fake news no matter where it comes from. It’s the only way to get the cabal to stop trying to kill someone they already think is dead.
90% of modern art is just tax evasion.

I remember my art history 101 prof telling us about this kind of thing in 1989. Big scam that's been going on since forever.
More likely, art is used to mask what is really being sold/conveyed.

$20 million for a splash of paint? O.K.

But, I always wonder what was really bought and sold. Human trafficking? Arms? Drugs? Political favors?
FYI this is not actually how wealthy people avoid paying taxes. There are much simpler, less risky ways to get out of taxes for the wealthy. 

The grain of truth here is that wealthy people do collect as patrons groups of artists who they then promote among their well connected circles with the hopes that one of the artists will become a big name. 

Many wealthy people view collecting art as a relatively stable way of investing as a hobby. The thinking, simplified, is that once you buy a painting, you have assigned that painting a value of whatever you paid for it. Worst case, you could re-sell it for about the same price later on, or simply enjoy the piece for what it is. But like housing, the expected trajectory is that as an artist becomes more famous via promotion from benefactors, the value of the  art will only go up. 

And largely, this seems to bear out to be true. Collecting art is at worst a break even sport for most wealthy people.
The IRS allows you to deduct contributions up to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year. So if your AGI was $100,000, you may be able to deduct $50,000 in charitable donations.  
.  
In OP's scenario, the "millionaire" in question could write off up to 10 million in contributions to charities. At 20 million dollars of income, in my state (No state income tax) $3,902,411 would be your federal income tax.  
.
I am member of the ACCA, CPA and CMA. In short, I know more about financial and tax accounting than the average person.

This is not how any of this works. Please stop spreading misinformation.

I would change point 2: "discover" random shitty artist and simultaneously stroke own god complex by making them famous.
I know this is /r/conspiracy but taxes... don't work that way. Like all other ridiculousness aside, do you guys really think that people have an option between paying their taxes to the government and donating it to somewhere else?

Rich avoid taxes within legal limits / loopholes. This, as presented is not one of those methods.
This wouldn’t work. First, charitable donations deductions are limited to 50% of income. Second, IRS pub 561 outlines very specific rules for determining the value of art. If you paid an artist $25k for a painting and suddenly it was valued at 20 million, the IRS requires an explanation of the increase in value. And for donations of art over $50k, you need to pay the IRS a fee, and get an appraisal from a qualified appraiser that is approved by the IRS. Such an obvious fraud scheme would generate many flags for the IRS.
Also jewelry. Rich people can buy art and jewelry, take it back to whatever country they need to, and resell it or whatever. 

Easy way to get around claiming $10k in cash at customs. 

This isn't a conspiracy, it's literally what happens.
If you owe 20M in taxes, then spending 20M won't make you owe $0 in taxes.
And money laundering. Probably easier to get away with then real estate, but the dollar amounts are lower
Could this be similar to when they set up their own charity foundation and donate their money into it?
I thought the banana picture was a clear case of money laundering...
Wandering around the Tate Modern one day on a GB/EU tour, I was laughin' at some of the exhibits. I even bought the book with photos of them.

Shit like an empty white room with hardwood floors, like a racquetball court, and a pile of cement blocks dumped on the floor in the middle of the room. 

Another was five or six 4' long fluorescent tube lights mounted together in a clump and lit-up, one of them flickering slightly.

One item was a rectangular piece of tan fabric with a single diagonal slash cut through the center, framed on the wall. It had its own wall.

Definitely helped that we had kind bud left over from Amsterdam. Nevertheless, I kept telling the GF to come into the other room and look at this shit, while I'm scratching my head giggling.
Well the artist still gets 25k. It’s trickle down schmukelnomics.
If it did not take talent that a normal person does not possess, a stroke of creativity that is less than profound, or an amount of effort that does not bewilder, then it is not art. Banana taped to a wall is not art. Fortune cookies stacked in a corner is not art. Why doesn't the IRS take apart the art world for a while?
I always thought it was a form of money laundering lol
its not the artists. its the whole market around it all that is cancer. there is so amazing art being made and a lot of very expensive art looks great. but a painting for 20 million dollars is fucking bullshit. And it kinda makes me sad seeing that people are dismissing art just because it is expensive. its the corrupt galeries selling them and the pseudo cultural billionaires buying them.

Most art these days is just a front for money-laundering and tax evasion.
Plus it’s a good way to hide(P2P) monetary transactions, for say, black market or illegal activities or anything in its exchange. Like people, for a picture as a trade, the art can be worth (insert cost of people in transaction) any varying number decided between parties.... human trafficking payments in the open. Insulting the masses. That’s why they really love modern art. It’s not about the art.
There's certainly shifty ways to move money through art, but this is not one of them.
Does anyone know about the banana stuck to a wall with ducktape.
That’s not how taxes work.  You can only donate up to 50% of your AGI.   Would still have to pay taxes on the remaining 10M. Also donations claimed for more than $50k are independently appraised by the IRS to check for fraud. So this entire post is mostly BS.

The real scam is when the wealthy set up a fake charity and put their kids on the board.  They then write off the massive charitable “donations” to the charity and the charity pays his kids millions of dollars in salary as board members.
That’s not how tax write offs work
[deleted]
That line at the end, though... It could turn this whole bullshit outrage-inducing post into just rolling your eyes at another poor person because they have a waxed moustache. It's distracting, unnecessary. Ya'll live how you want but I'm not going for those red herrings anymore, anywhere.

The wealthy make my life harder. The wealthy corrupt and abuse the system, at our expense. Not hipsters, not black people, not immigrants, not conservatives, not old people, not young people. The wealthy. They're my enemy. I'm not making any time for anything else.
This is accurate and not a conspiracy at all. I once met with an contemporary artist seeking help to make a market for his material.

He explained it like this : An Artist creates cache of work. Then, Art Dealer partners up with Artist to control his entire cache supply before it hits the market. Art Dealer calls his best 10 Collectors and sells each of them a piece of artwork for $100,000. (All of his Collectors are in on the scheme.)  So, his 10 Collectors each buy a $100,000 piece of contemporary artwork.  Now, the Art Dealer goes to an auction house with a fresh piece of work from the Artist's cache.  The auction begins at 100,000 and people start calling in. Who calls in? The "10 Collectors" who already own the artwork by the same artist.  They all bid up the auction from $100,000 to $1,000,000.  Now guess what? Those "10 Collectors" just 10x'd their original $100,000 piece of artwork into $1,000,000.

Now that the auction house has established a formal market for the pricing of the Artist's work, the Art Dealer openly sells more artwork to foreign investors (Chinese, Russian, etc) for $1,000,000 because the auction established it there. The Art Dealer's job is to make sure the pricing stays high and controls supply and demand.  Many people who buy art at $1,000,000 use it as a way to park their money.

In fact, often artwork sits in a FreePort ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva\_Freeport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Freeport) ) and doesnt even hang on a wall.

Anyway, you get the picture now. Don't read into contemporary art too much.  Its a lot of bs.
Anyone moderately wealthy cheats on their taxes, hell plenty of normal people do, and good for all of them fuck the irs.
It's also a perfect way to launder illegally obtained money.
http://mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf
Tax evasion? Nah. Money laundering? Definitely
with the recent talk about the banana on the wall, just wanted to point this out.
I used to do trade work at former Goldman Sachs president estate. The amount of stupid art he had was ridiculous.  Me and the other techs used to joke that “ this is art” when it looked like a baby smeared his dirty diaper on canvas.
 > "In effect, what modernism in the arts represents is the collapse into complete solipsism and nihilism. As Barnhisel aptly puts it, one modernist understood modernism as 'self-referentiality' to such an extent that its products could be viewed as 'self-contained artifacts whose meaning was not dependent upon social context, the biography of the artist, or the reception of the reader or perceiver.' In effect, **it is a complete divorce from all culture, that is, from all that is humanizing and psychologically integrative.** Indeed, such extreme self-referentiality, if translated from the cultural to the clinical contexts, would be considered dissociative and sociopathic. By promoting it, the American intelligence community in effect not made modernism the intelligence community's, and America's and the West's, 'chosen' and 'imperial art', the preferred vehicle to present its bourgeois 'liberal values', but also introduced a form of art that *drove* dissociative and sociopathic pathologies into general culture.

 > As such, modernism also became not just America's 'imperial art," it became the 'establishment.' If one bemoans the all-pervasive influence of modernism in America's graduate art, literature, or music departments, this is why. It could 'mean' anything, or nothing at all, but in either case there was no *Affekt* in any traditional sense. For example, for Nelson Rockefeller and the Rockefellers in general, modernism in art represented 'free enterprise,' and capitalism, its chief efforts were not inspiration in the artist or perceiver, but, because of its rejection of all tradition and emphasis on self-referentiality, its chief inspiration and effect was revulsion, and a kind of opposition for opposition's sake, and shock."

Does anyone remember u/RMFN ?
#Yes
Ive also heard it was for transferring money around. I want to give you 20 million dollars for some illegal product/service. I can't just write you a check, but you can sell a painting at an auction, and I will bid 20 million for it. Worst case scenario, someone out bids me on a worthless painting, and it's a "free" 20 mil for you.
Who cares. We shouldn't be stolen from via taxes to begin with.
I know it seems like money laundering must be the reason for overpriced terrible art, but the art world is more complex than that. Galleries show this kind of work as a way to signal that their offerings are exclusive. THEY are trying to keep YOU the hell away from THEM. Regular people like beautiful artwork. But they are not regular people, they are elites. They are people for whom $100k is to them like a hundred bucks is to you. It's not meaningful how much they spend, only that it is more than you could ever afford. They distance themselves from you when they spend life-changing money on garbage art. They are signaling their contempt for mundane values. They are signaling that they are the people who understand this kind of work (whether they do or not) and you are not. They have no idea we're laughing at them and frankly they don't care. In the case of this banana art, it was a memento that inspired the artist, an avant-garde sculptor. He hung it on his wall as inspiration to be more amusing with his work. It should never have left his studio wall. He had no business showing it for sale in Miami but the gallery owner agreed to do it and I'll bet they thought something just like this would happen. And they love that we're outraged.
Even if you could manage this, you could only itemize the contribution for 30% of your AGI maximum per year.  Still could be worth it, but it would never directly result in paying *no* taxes.

If you sold it for cash and donated that, you could deduct up to 60% of your AGI.  

But don’t get me wrong, problems like this [do exist.](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-irs2mar02-story.html)
More like money laundering
Nah I don't think 90% is tax evasion. A big part of that is money laundering too.
I’ve been saying the same thing for years but with the “artist” being a criminal in some way. Say I wanna sell you drugs and you wanna buy them from me... I simply make some crap art that you buy from me for the amount the drugs were gonna cost you... then you walk away with some piece of “art” you may be able to sell to some moron as well as all the drugs I just sold you and I get to put that money directly into the bank because it looks like I sell art and not drugs.
Not how deductions work, there are caps on donation writeoffs, but that's just details.
Math is off,but you've got a general sense of what is going on.
Another theory running is they take this “art” and sell it to someone and with this “art” comes a little child. 

#pizzagate
Of course you'd need to recognize that $1.975 million in profit before being able to write off $2 million in charitable donations. That puts a bit of a damper on the proceedings. But don't let me get in the way of your righteous fury, just clean up when you're done.
The tax write off is the lower of cost or market.  The appraisal is required when donated property has a cost and value of more than 5k.  It is shit like this that makes people stupid.
Artist duck-tapes banana to a wall.  
Miami couple buys it for $120k.  
Different artist eats banana as performance art.  
Art museum buys remaining duck-tape banana for $150k.  
Museum donors wonder why museum couldn't just spend 3 bucks and duck-tape their own banana to a wall.
That's hardly fair.

Only 35% of modern art is tax evasion. The other 65% is money laundering.
Contemporary art
Rich people will find a way to not pay taxes. Then the middle and lower class end up paying. That's what happen when they introduced new tax laws on the rich way back when.
Takeaway: Artists are severely underpaid.
This!
I've never understood people's greed. I mean 20 million dollars is a fuck ton of money, I mean I could live off half a million dollars for the rest of my life comfortably, and sumbitch that makes tens of millions of dollars is so greedy that they do shit like this to avoid paying taxes it's just ridiculous
I hate the hipster more than anyone else in that scenario
It's not just the art world. It happens in all intellectual property and intangibles. This is why the mob has always been involved in the music business, Hollywood, and more recently the software development game. You really think it costs a billion dollars to create a marvel movie? Is there anyway for authorities to verify whether the top act on a record label sold 1 million copies of their album, or how many streams their single had online, or how many tickets on their tour? All those numbers are easily inflatable. Then there is the enterprise software racket. Copy pasta some open source code of some generic database or CRM type software, then sell licenses for 60k a pop that expire every year. Rinse repeat.
If the millionaire purchased a piece from the artist for 25k, then had the work appraised for $20M, then the appraiser would most definitely lose their license. As an art appraiser, you MUST be unbiased in your valuation of the work, accounting for many different variables. And, appraisal value doesn’t always equate to the value you would receive on a tax write off. 

Also, museums won’t accept any random piece of artwork just for the sake of housing artwork. They have limited space, works must be voted on by a panel and usually they are looking for works/artists which have significant context from an art historical perspective, which to the average person “you just wouldn’t understand.”

I’m not saying that millionaires don’t abuse their wealth by purchasing art to gain more favorable tax incentives, because they do. It’s just not as simple as how this post makes it seem, and I don’t want the conspiracy nuts to start burning artwork or not supporting museums for the sake of spiting the rich...

Wait .. wtf. You can get tax write-offs for donating ART?

You should only be able to get tax write-offs for donating things like clothing, food, money to charities, etc... Shit that actually helps poor people.
Hipsters are painfully dumb
I heard that some of that "art" is just someone doing something for the first time. I think I heard it in relation to that guy who just painted a canvas red (side note: some crazy guy kept coming to the gallery and cutting up that painting.  Interesting shit).  I don't get it.
You forgot to mention that the museum is owned by the millionaire.
We went to an art museum before and one of the things we seen was  a shelf hang on the wall
Usually it’s some old fart telling me I’m the uncultured one. While he’s shaking hands with the gallery’s owner
That is why in the Daredevil series, the Kingpin makes the white painting central to his relationship. Finally, a woman who appreciates the finer points money laundering.
I 100% agree with this, its the only thing that makes modern art make sense.
I once had an art teacher who argued with the entire class over a blue canvas. That's all it was, a blue fucking canvas.
He argued with anyone who told him its not art, he would say "art is subjective, there is nothing you can say is not art if you are told it is."
My silent response was always "if that were true then you're essentially saying your job is fucking pointless."

I hated that guy. Spent the first half of every class talking politics and the next half yelling about how everything is art.
Replace line on canvas with banana taped to wall.
I donated a bag of clothes to Goodwill that definitely wasn't worth $1000....I need to up my game
As an artist, I would really like someone to use me as a tax deduction. Thank you...
After seeing [this red square] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square_%28painting%29?wprov=sfla1) hanging in the MOMA, I never felt like going back there. Most other museums I'd go to gladly, but I actually want to be inspired by what I see there, so MOMA is not for me.
100% of taxes is just legalized theft.
Aside from the economic aspect. The cultural and historical significance of modern art is also no coincidence. 

"Art in Weimar experienced a similar descent into meaningless, perverse works that inspired nothing but sadness and discord. "Dadaism" & "Cubism" were all the rage. The Elites promoted this as "intellectual" and modern. Sound familiar? Painters like Hanns Ludwig Katz did well."

https://mobile.twitter.com/usrevolt1776/status/1204440949616791555?s=12 here is the link to the entire twitter thread discussing the topic. Very interesting stuff, can be read in less then 5 minutes.
Tax write-offs don't work like that.
Hello, artist here (and not a hipster one). 

1) are you talking about contemporary art or modern art? Words mean stuff and junk.

2) when you are speaking about bullshit art like a line on a canvas, are you assuming that there was no intent/idea/inspiration behind that line on the canvas? 

3) who is guilty in this scheme? The purchaser of the art? The artist? The appraiser? The gallery? The museum? All of them? Lots of moving parts here, and I think it would be wise to better define your terms. 

4) I would like to know your knowledge of art history. Modern art vs. contemporary art. What led to the current trends in contemporary art, etc. It's easy to say a banana taped to a wall is shit art. It's also very easy to look at a nice painting of a sunset and say it's art. Neither of which may be true. 

5) in conclusion, while it may be true that the art market is a way to move wealth around, evade taxes, what have you, it is also true that the vast majority of the American public indeed does not allow themselves to access most contemporary art until an art historian tells them it's art. Example, the banana. Once you open yourself up to the idea that art can be more than a nice painting of a sunset, you may find you actually appreciate things like a streak on a canvas.
Professional artist here, can confirm 100% true. Additionally billionaires have high value work as bragging rights the way plebs collect... anything... magic cards come to mind. I was at a family gathering and my late aunts fiance was a founder of a major computer brand, in one of his offices at a 20+ mil house he had thomas hill paintings that dwarfed walls. His rumpus room was full of kandinsky’s... and he didnt even live there. It was unreal. Turns out He had to spend 2.5 million a month to evade taxes on his wealth and he still came out ahead.

Edit: also dont forget to notice the insurance game played on art. Inevitably real items get damaged or age. However the return on investment is guaranteed via insurance.
This is BS by someone who doesn’t understand accounting. I’m not even an accountant and it seems silly.

If you have lump of meme you bought for £1.00, and due to the crazy meme economy it’s value increases to £1,000,000 you owe no tax as you haven’t actualised that gain. But when you finally sell it for £1M, you will need to pay capital gains tax on £999,999 of %19. If you were to give it away instead you pay no tax but you get no tax writeoff (well ok, £1 writeoff) as you never lost anything.

There are easier ways to avoid tax that are commonly used and involved less BS.

For money laundering this would make sense though.
I agree.  Look at John and Tony Podesta’s “art”... https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@gizmosia/art-podesta-admires-and-buys-you-may-never-sleep-well-again
I was in a modern art museum in high school.  I walked into a string hanging from the ceiling.  Thought it was a cobweb or something at first.  Pulled on it and the security came running over telling me not to touch the display.  Oh, my bad.  I didn't know a fucking piece of string hanging from the ceiling counted as artwork.  If that's the case then the finger painting I did in preschool belongs in the library of Alexandria.  

&#x200B;

Glad someone in line at the museum told me that you don't actually have to pay $40 to get in, its just the "suggested donation," though the sign doesn't say that.  I told the lady I only have 15 cents, and she rolled her eyes and took my 15 cents and gave me the ticket.  Turns out that was the biggest waste of 15 cents of my life.
Art has always been a scam. That being said, I've seen a painting that acctualy felt like it spoke to me, couldn't stop staring and it was just a bunch of colors. I felt like I would have paid anything to have it but it was owned by a museum here in Sweden.
This isn't how it works at all.

They would end up paying about $2m more in taxes if they "Got away with it."
Except that’s not how it works at all. 

According to the IRS “ collectors may deduct the lesser of cost basis or fair market value up to 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) and carry the deduction forward for up to five years.”

So they only get to deduct from their income what they paid. But that doesn’t fit the narrative.
I like modern art
"This is stupid, it's just a line on a canvas." 

You don't understand art but you're still right on the tax evasion thing.
I thought the Podestas only had one reason for their art collection.
Now we know they have two.
woah..
Alternatively:  to launder coke money.
While some people thinks this means modern art is stupid, it's really just the tax code that is stupid. Get rid of certain tax write offs, increase capital gains tax, consider a negative income tax (or UBI as some call it) for lowest income earns, and have a much steeper progressive income tax law, closer to what it was in U.S. when we were booming closer to WWII
Hahah. Its hard to be mad
At this though
It’s Friday and I feel a little slow but I’m not understanding what the scam is here?

Like, the millionaire in this scenario still had to pay $25M just to declare $20M, right? So not only are they losing $5M but they’re still paying out the $20M they would have had to pay to the government, correct? So what’s the benefit?

Is it something like if you have enough write offs it changes your tax bracket? Or is it just about if you’re gonna spend this money anyway you’d rather look like a big shot because of your museum donations?
Fuck off with that title
Now it all makes sense
It's also a way of money laundering. You pay cash under the table. Then get it appraised. Then the cash is clean when you sell it.
Trying to rip off mm as usual

Keep it up
Source for that figure or 90% is just a made up number.
90% of it is ugly too.
This is known. So how is this a conspiracy? Asking for a friend.
Yeah.. pretty insane.
Hipsters think they *get it* lol
Also plays a part in drug and human trafficking circles. 

Cash changes hands for something that's value is based on intangibles, namely a certain piece of art.

20 million for paint on a piece of paper, but really a truckload of cocaine. 

IRS can't ask questions, because they can't challenge the value of something when said things value is based on intangibles.
The Hollywood Movie Industry is the world's largest money laundering operation.
This absolutely has to stop or I need to start being the bullshit artist for hire guy. One of the two.
I should be an artist to get in on this scheme.
Also money laundering.
Money laundering and tax evasion
Yup, tax evasion and money laundering.
Paging /r/accounting 


Are people really believing this? That's not how this works
That’s a good idea thanks!
That's not even a conspiracy theory lmao. If you're even into art on a surface level it's very obvious.
Overvaluation of charitable contributions is the oldest trick in the book.
Colleague of mine told me a lot of Chinese billionaires buy super expensive art to smuggle money out of the country. There's a limit to the amount of dough you can get out of China and the super wealthy don't want to raise too many eyebrows with large wire transfers. Solution is to buy super expensive art at auctions in China, roll up a painting into a tube, take it on a flight overseas, sell it and buy a couple of houses/commercial real estate buildings.
Bitcoin and comic book art on not based on anything either.

Someone outlawing cryptos or cool pictures of Wolverine anytime soon?
In a way, that story rounds it back into being art because it's a cultural signifier of the times 🤔
Problem is a 20 million dollar write off is not a tax credit your get only part back.

The real scam comes from starting charity’s and putting family in charge of them.

Anything the charity does if it maintains it’s nonprofit status is tax exempt.
We should vote for politicians who are willing to close tax loopholes instead of trying to create new ones
there is a tv show made about this. it is true
lol and the sky is blue
Where can I get a job as one of these artists?
Okay, but where does the museum get that $20M? It's basically a scheme to get museums to pay your taxes, and I don't get why museums go along with it.
The most unrealistic part of this is that they paid the artist instead of coercing them to work for exposure haha
If it's sold at a value above the original purchase price, that person is responsible for cap gains taxes.
basically insider trading, right?
“Uncultured Swine”
I'd like to know who's hiring artists for one piece of work for 25k lol
ITT: Uncultured swine and philistinism. Art has been an integral part of the lives of the rich and super rich since ancient Egypt
This absolutely happens but saying “it’s not art because i don’t understand it” doesn’t mean it’s not art.
You have to hold the property for one year to do this, otherwise you can only deduct cost.
My brother was just telling me that this is why art is valued so highly. The museum gets to say their collection is prestigious and worth more, while the donor gets more tax writeoff. It’s a hilariously corrupt system
Tax scam and awesome way to launder money.
>90% of modern art is just tax evasion

I know like modern art
Close. It’s actually money laundering.
Legal loophole
Read Jean Baudrillard, the Conspiracy of Art if you wanna be truly next level
Waaaait I'm still confused.

In this scenario, on the one hand it sounds like the millionaire is pulling one over by getting a $20m tax write-off.................

But he had to pay $20m to do that. How is he winning here? Isn't this exactly the same as him donating $20m to a charity and getting a tax write-off?

Can someone explain?
TIL People do not understand capital gains and income as it relates to taxes and value.

Money laundering, sure. Tax evasion, very doubtful.
Modern art is money laundering, not tax evasion.
>donates $20m to get $20m write off, pays no taxes

that's not how any of this works
https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html%3famp

Their friends in the CIA helped them too..
Good lord 🏅

You know what, its christmas!   Have Another !! 🏅
The taxman isn’t that stupid.  There’s a concept called fair market value and the taxman is very good at calculating it.  

Art may not be used for tax evasion in this way, but it’s certainly used for money laundering and moving money across borders and other shady stuff.
This is some bad r/accounting batman
But the money was spent ,even though your taxable income went down, it’s still money spent taxable income is lower .
Hahaha. All the upvotes.
r/scamsrevealed worthy
Quick contrary opinion:  

There's a famous painter named Ad Reinhardt, who painted a series of huge black canvas' in the '60.  I remember seeing them in an exhibition at MOCA in LA many, many years ago.

The show as a retrospective, and set up in pretty much chronological order.  You began looking at his very early work which looked unremarkable, frankly.  Then in the 1940s he started to work primarily with geometric shapes and colors, on very large canvases.  And as you walked through the museum you saw his progression as he broke down things, and ideas, into their most base form visually, eventually in the 1950s making huge painting of very large but simple shapes, and then ultimately concentrating one color onto one canvas, one specific series being these huge black canvas'.

Now, if you were to see those painting outside of that context, or even enter the gallery from the exit and work backwards, of course you would say, "It's just a huge black canvas, my child could paint this! Modern Art is all a sham!"

And, yeah, honestly sometimes it is.  But more often than not, context is important, and things seen out of context are easy to be judged wrongly. 

Sure there's money laundering in the art world, of course there is.  Doesn't mean all art becomes meaningless.
yOu jUsT dO'Nt geT DadAiSm!!!
Do you remember?

Nobody. Forgot. About. It. We just can't do shit about it.
mission statement: When the US senate was deliberating on coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic many of them sold shares which later tanked. I haven't heard any news of this recently.

Rep. susan davis sold shares in airlines and cruise ships the day the US reported it's 10th case, a full 2 weeks before the first crash happened, before trump even made his "we only have 15 cases and it's going to go down to zero" comment.

Even the diamond princess had only recorded it's first case when she sold her shares.

They sold shares in airlines before trump even announced the travel ban to china which he did VERY early into the crisis and didn't even ban european travel until a month after they sold their shares off.
For your awareness, the Senate Ethics Committee has opened an investigation. There is no average length an investigation takes so a ruling could come out within weeks or within months. This has not been forgotten.
Posting this here for relevancy.

[Timeline of stock crash, 24hr corona coverage and beginning of bailout](https://i.redd.it/2zs1d23edho41.jpg)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Now that this post has hit top and some folks are unwittingly (or deliberately) misinterpreting this reply, let me spill the beans a bit:

**Coronavirus was known about for awhile.** Reports date back as early as November last year.

**Yet the media only started 24hr coverage on the 23rd of February - why then?**

Indeed, **the very next day Congress was asked for cash** **under the pretense of preparing for it.**

# Is it significant that the stock market started to tank 3 days earlier?

**With all the bailouts and Wall st trickery currently going on, How does that scenario sit with you in light of what has transpired since?**

Never let a good crisis go to waste gentlemen.
There is just entirely too much going on to focus on anything.
Politicians should not be allowed to trade stocks,,,
If I were Martha Stewart, I’d be really pissed off every single time this happened.

Life sentence for us. 

Life as usual for them.
I didn’t.
I don’t tweet mean things to people, I don’t tweet people in general- but I had to tweet to that Georgia senator lady that she is an absolute embarrassment to the soul of humanity, a disgrace of a life form.
I did that right after i watched the video of her creepy face trying to say it’s socialists that are upset about her trading... like oh yeah, so everyone should be fine and dandy of you taking advantage of Americans and you’re just so entitled to insider trading, but the rest of us aren’t. Fuck her
Meanwhile I got a fine for fishing
Remember Epstein?
Aye, I was actually talking to my partner about this. 

Fine, if it were a couple hundred thousand, that's just whatever.

But millions? They literally tanked the stock market on purpose. Fucking dipshits. 

They should be held accountable but that'll never happen.
And the one that lied aboit how much insider trading she did was punished by being put on the committee to reopen America!
One of them being the literal fucking spouse of the CEO of the Stock Exchange.

They don’t play by our rules because we don’t hold them to any viable consequence. Change that.
Pepperidge farm remembers
Remember when everyone forgot what insider trading is? Look I'm not trying to say what these people did was right,*however* it was **not** insider trading.

For those of you, and there appears to be many of you, who dont know what insider trading is. In broad strokes. It is when you are privy to information **NOT** widely available to the public and trade based on that information. An example being. You learn from a friend who works at a major company that this major company is about to announce a merger with another major company that will undoubtedly raise share costs. Then you act on it by buying or selling shares.

Why is this not a case of this? Because simply put it was public information that there was a highly infectious disease spreading across the Asian world. Literally everyone knew this. These folks simply read the market, and where right. Now mind you while privately selling shares they where publicly saying everything was going to be fine. Isn't that more typical American politics though?

Here are some questions to ask yourself about a situation in the future to narrow down if something is insider trading. Could anyone have acted this way? In this case yes. If you had stock you could have sold it off in fear of the virus hitting America. And could it have failed? Again in this case yes. It was possible I'll be it unlikely that the virus never made it to the US and or the market was not effected in a major way by it. 

The only thing these people are guilty of is saying to the public that everything was fine while selling shares. The only way this could be insider trading on any level is if you can **PROVE** these people had access to information about the virus **AND** it's effects on the market before that information was made available to the public. 

In closing, what they did was morally shit. It was a fucked up thing to do. However you and everyone else could have done the same thing. Its call wallstreet, this shit happens every day. "Oh yeah Frank I think buying shares in that company is a great idea" later that day "Frank is an idiot, that idea is never going to pan out. I'm not buying any shares in that company". Or in this situation. "Don't worry about virus. Everything will be fine. Keep calm and carry on" later that day. "I don't believe that shit at all. I'm selling all my shares. I would rather be safe then sorry." I mean what do you suggest instead of this? They have gone on TV and said "HOLY SHIT WE ARE ALL DOOMED THE MARKET IS DOOMED SELL ALL YOUR SHIT!" They did what literally every politician has done since the literal beginning of politics.
nobody forgot.   they’re being investigated.
I don't think it took insider trading to foresee what was going to happen in the states considering that it had already happened in several other countries first
I remember when this exact thing was posted a week after it happened and how a bunch of people posted links to these people getting charges/fines for doing it. Damn repost /s
I'm so very tired of these posts. I don't think anyone has forgotten about this yet. It was literally still in the news this morning.
Yeah, im still fucking floored about this. Even more mad martha stewart went to jail for sum1 giving her a heads up. And these people used classified briefings to profit from
Is it really insider trading or just smart investing. A pandemic or worldwide crisis will always result in a market plummet. Why wouldn't you sell off shit and short certain options?
Oh I remember, but I also know that nothing will ever happen to them for it so what's the point in stewing about it
I've been following options lately and I have this app that shows very large orders of options and on April 16th there was a giant order for options that expire that Friday. After hours on the 16 GILD came out with news of a possible vaccine. Who ever placed that order the day before made 6000%. Everything is manipulated
We barely made it 6 weeks into the quarantine  before we forgot about science (again!) and kicked off round 2 of the pandemic. Not a good look.
Just like the president! Only difference is he's forgotten about the pandemic as well.
> half a dozen  
  
Why not just say six?
Kelly Loeffler was just added to Trump's special wiz-bang corona virus committee.  She'll definitely continue to know just what stocks to buy and sell.
What can we as individuals actually do about it? It seems like we know so much corruption yet these people still go about it like it doesnt matter. 

What is the next step for us individuals after becoming aware?
No one forgot. What are you expecting Average Joe to do?
It's not really conspiracy when the government screws the people. It's expected.
Isn't that being investigated?
Everyone in America could see what was going on in China. I tried telling people this was gonna crash the economy before the US got it’s first case. It’s not insider trading it’s just smart. 

Now if you wanna talk about the record number of CEOs stepping down in the months leading up to this... that has substance
You surprised?
No I don't remember people pretending it never happened. I've seen news stories about it every day since.
Remember when nearly all major governments, in virtually the exact same manner, shut down businesses and locked everyone in their houses for months — doing massive irreversible damage to the economy, small businesses, human rights, civil liberties and millions of lives — because of a 'virus' that's about as dangerous as a seasonal flu, poses no real threat to the vast majority of the population and could be completely dealt with simply by recommending that the old and immunocompromised consider remaining at home for a while?

Or that find even Jared Kushner far set up a shadow COVID counsel with his buddies and companies he used to run? With no oversight on top of it. So who is really going to win because of the pandemic? Just saying.
If I was a shady politician... id be rubbing my hands like birdman right now playboi...
His name was seth rich
How it went down from my perspective..first, if comes out Republicans insider traded. My “progressive” friends and the media absolutely melt down. Then it comes out Feinstein  insider traded way more $, they all completely move on.. and make no mention of if.
Those people were Republicans though. I'm surprised anyone in this sub actually cares.
It wasn't insider trading, but this will get downvoted because this post will be astroturfed
I ‘member it all.
SEC hasn’t forgotten... investigations and build up to prosecution take time.
I remember reading about dozens of CEO's retiring months before it started spreading in the states.  I have no doubt they were tipped off shit was about to shut down and they took their retirements and cashouts and ran for the hills
I’m so tired of Reddit politics. Those Republican senators? We’re just gonna leave out that Nancy Pelosi literally profited millions of dollars by buying up Amazon stocks a few days before agreeing to shut down businesses in her state?

Remember, it’s only evil if a Republican does it.￼
[deleted]
One of them was my US senator, definitely didn’t forget
A half dozen senators... *that got caught*
I member
Thank you. Your kindness means the world
We remember. NEVER FORGET
They didn't profit off a pandemic?
It’s 5G
I member.
Got perma banned from r/politics over it.
Were the senators given information specific to the securities they sold? Or did they take non public  information and make their own decisions about stocks they sold? The answer is important as one is illegal insider trading and the other is not.
They probably bought when it went down too.
Nothing against the heart of the person who said this, but what a stupidly self-defeating way to convey the message. It basically just assumes that the news cycle is the only way we know about anything. We need to assume that most folks pay attention and that they care, because most people do. 

Instead, let's say: "Don't forget how these people profited on death, trading on insider information rather than disseminating the information to protect the public. Blood is on their hands, and they will be brought to justice."
[removed]
Do you remember what gave them this inside information?

An intelligence briefing from this Administration. Weeks before Trump acknowledged the seriousness of the pandemic, he and the Senate were being briefed that it was serious.

Why was Trump praising Xi and saying he thought China would contain it when he was being told the opposite by our Intel Community?
Ever seen Ozark on Netflix?  I bet so much money laundering going on right now with all the money moving around for supplies and infrastructure.
I don't know. The selling talked about is from February, by which we all knew about the pandemic but considered it a nothing burger. The information that the senators had the we didn't was probably not decisive, but social forces persuaded moat of us that it was not a big deal.
This should really be a hanging offence too. Case-closed. But whatever, orange man probably said something that I'm supposed to be outraged over.
u/repostsleuthbot
I wonder how far the elite have to screw/destroy the public before the sheep even notice?
I member, what’s nice is can can at least call it out in our echo chambers and it’s in the public record. At least there was some public shaming that happened with this. Not sure if anyone would have even noticed 30 years ago, but hell maybe the vitriol would have been worse. Any gen x or boomers to confirm?
How did they profit, did they not just self off assests? Sorry haven't read much into this one
Okay cool, we remember. What are we supposed to do about it?
Nobody forgot, there’s just no recourse.
Pepperidge farms remembers
I made some money too when this happened, does that make me a bad guy because I could see the inevitable?
It's crazy the things we'll do to feel normal again.
I would say there should clearly be a law that they can't own stocks or other investments, but then they'd just get a beard to do this insider trading for them, so not sure it would solve anything other than make it harder to find this stuff happening.
Remember when possibly the highest profile person who’s ever been in federal custody had his cameras malfunction and he committed suicide with no investigation..that was cool
My dad just laughed at me and said "that's legal" as if there's not a massive issue with that, regardless of whether or not the law approves.
Finally, and actual reality-based conspiracy on this sub
I did not forget. But luckily for my local democracy, I am not American.
Yeah I remember, and I don't care enough to try to do anything about it. And neither do you, pussy, so shut the fuck up.
lol what are you gonna do make them give back their earnings or go to jail? Capitalism motherfucker /s
Yeah that’s not how the justice system works. There were a series of articles that were published, they don’t necessarily constitute evidence. There will probably be several independent investigations by the DoJ, the SEC, maybe the NYSE since the one senator’s husband works there, and not to mention an ethics inquiry in the Senate. It’s not like getting caught with a brick of cocaine, financial crimes take longer to investigate. Not to mention you have to obtain warrants for access to their financial records and communications.

Edit: also not saying these people are innocent, just trying to provide some prospective on the process.
Kind of like trillions of dollars went missing on 9/10/2001 and 9/12/2001 everyone forgot about it?
Remember when the rich and powerful got away with horrific crimes while the poor suffered for it? Yeah, like a thousand times.
Now this is a repost I'm happy to see every single day.
The story was immediately dropped when Democrats were caught doing it, too.
You can't trust a politician, not one.
no one forgot. there was just a pandemic going on.
Ehile martha Stewart went to prison to set an example is what congress said. Yes some of us remember but now the shoe is on the foot of government officials so im sure the LAW won't apply to those scumbags.

I feel sorry for you Americans it's no wonder your so confused on the laws.
I'm still wondering to this day about that shit..
I don't like these "do you remember X and then everyone forgot and nothing happened" posts because I feel like it's trying to normalize the idea of everyone forgetting and nothing happening.

It's supposed to express my outrage, but in reality the OP is just programming us to be passive and accept things we shouldn't accept.
Who hasn’t tried to profit off the current stock market? I mean c’mon.
Remember when this was last reposted and no one did shit about it?
that's how mafia works
This will probably get downvoted to hell, but news sources had been reporting on Coronavirus since December. It was all public knowledge, so is it really insider trading?
I remember how this was posted here 48 times.
This occurred prior to the stock market tanking, being shut down and reset three times in one week.

The 'stimulus' injected there was over a trillion to keep it afloat, which won't last.

Imo, thats what the Coveridup is distracting everyone from. The lockdown is to prevent us from revolting. They can't believe their ruse is working.
I think I see this tweet reposted and reaching the front page several times a week. Just because you don't see a live update broadcast doesn't mean nothing is happening. But we're talking about the US government, so they've probably exonerated themselves already.
Yes and it's [being investigated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-lawmakers-for-possible-insider-trading-11585586365). So why try to make it seem like nothing is being done?
Why are they even allowed to own stocks? This is fucking bullshit and everyone knows it.
It’s not about we forgot. Wtf can the public do about it.
Laws no longer matter for anyone in politics
Remember when they got appointed to the task force for restarting the economy? It happened a couple of days ago and nobody seems to care.
whatd they do? exactly?
So we're just using the same tweet format as the Panama papers and all of the under the radar changes to the security laws.
I think the trouble is people found out it was 100% legal... and politicians writing laws that protect themselves is just one of the downsides of our current political process...
remember when we found out the elites of society were exposed as having dodged their taxes to the tune of trillions and the only thing that happened was the journalist who exposed it got murdered and nothing happened

remember when we found out the nsa and gchq are spying on everything we do illegally and the only thing that happened were the journalists involved got ran out of the country and forced into exile and nothing happened 

remember when we found out that there's a global pedophile ring that  involved likely hundreds of extremely well known celebrities and business people and politicians and the guy who was at the center of it got murdered in prison and nothing happened

all of these things are still going on, people don't care until they are told they should care. you get the world you deserve.
This is being investigated you dumb shits.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52097349

just none of you pay attention, hence why you post here.
This is why I buy Bitcoin. This is why we have to take the power of our labor value back from these monsters.
The US senators would approve drone striking their own civilians if it made them money at this point. They have no damn morals at all.
There was more outrage about a stupid video of celebrities singing than there was about this.
They’ve crafted a society where yeah we can know about things, but do absolutely nothing about it.

Can we “vote for someone better”, no, because they don’t allow people that arnt corrupt to the core to win elections, that would set a bad president.

What’s the other option? Revolution? Yeah maybe in 1776 where the government and the people both had muskets, now they have tanks and drones and stealth bombers, plus all the toxins they feed us to slow us down. There’s no revolution.

Same with those papers a few years back that proves the wealthy were dodging taxes, yeah we found out but what happened about it. Nothing, just like nothing happened here, and nothing will happen next time?
God. You just have to remember them!)
Anybody got all the names?
Thus, more and more we live in a world where nothing matters
Considering all the major news outlets covered it idk how we haven't got around to punishing them yet in the government
Yeah I remember. And no I didn’t forget.  This is pretty low grade. Even for this sub.
Keep posting this.
9 million things have happened since then.
Reminds me of that time Epstein didn't kill himself.
You may have forgotten about it, but people who's job it is to prosecute this type of behavior definitely haven't.  There will be investigations unless Barr blocks them.
I wonder if pepperidge farms will remember?
Do you remember that we're living through a Donald Trump presidency and it's 2020?
Here's my question all of r/conspiracy, what am I supposed to do about it? I mean, I would love to see crimes from upper level politicians prosecuted (ALL OF THEM), but really, what can I do? I sure as hell can't afford the lawyers to press the case myself. Post like this remind people, but what's supposed to happen?
Pepperidge fahrm remembahs
Remember when Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself?
It’s fucked up , in the US certain people are allowed to break the law
I made a bunch of money too and I don't know shit. Pay better attention I guess
Some member berries huh
TBH I also sold all my positions back in February when I saw this coming. I did not have insider information. I just read the news from China.

they also voted themselves raises as part of the bailout....
it's not that people don't forget. people are jaded and we feel powerless. not to mention we live in a police state where pre-crime is posting a mean thing on the internet
What the fuck am I suppose to do about it
When you become a congressman/senator or any politician for that matter, you can not trade stocks. 401K and that’s it. Your making enough money. Conflict of interest
Member?!?!
Some of them sold mid-March which was a massive mistake and just a loss of a lot of money
I fit the criteria for some millennial whos not on top of politics but is concerned when shit like this goes down. I think that instead of calling them corrupt senators they should really be called out by name. Instead of this faceless big bad corrupt government. Like when Jeff Bezos fucks up it gets more recognition because there is a name and a face to yell at essentially.
The Executive is responsible for law enforcement.  Trump chooses to do nothing for obvious reasons.
They paid you $1200 to forget, guys.
That's because most, not all but most politicians in Washington have been selling America down the river for decades so to them this was a no brainier.
I dont think everyone forgot I think they have some bullshit rule that says they are allowed to. Not to say it's not wrong but why they can get away with it

Well the justice dept is investigating them, so what's your question? You have may forgotten but the US Gov't hasn't.  Of course they're gonna keep that stuff out the news they have $$ and Power. However I think these senators have an out they will use and they will claim a 3rd oart has 100% access and decision over their portfolios which will argue that they did not commit insider trading. The law is subject to interpretation and how you can argue it.

Us govt investigating senators https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-lawmakers-for-possible-insider-trading-11585586365
I am surprised this didn't produce a Marie Antoinette situation. How are there people protesting with guns in America right now, and they're not protesting at these Senators' houses?

We're boned as a country. I just hope I get rich during the ensuing Civil War.
Do it again, I love seeing this on the front page for the 50th time.
Honestly it’s more of common sense that insider trading.
The only  thing I can think we can do is sign a petition to investigate these people.

No conspiracy when it’s legally allowed, just shitty laws
To my knowledge there have been several instances like that. Just not with a pandemic.
I liken this to volleyball. (Been watching that anime about volleyball). We are on the receiving end. We are trying to see where the spike is coming from but there are so many attackers fainting like they're spiking making us lose track of who really is going to spike and in the end, the opposing team gets their desired result; getting their point (passing laws or regulations, taking our money etc.) while we look dumbfounded at what just happened.
Trading should not be permitted while holding office as it’s a complete and total conflict of interest. They should be there to help Americans not enrich themselves.
almost like republicans aren't holding them accountable :thinking:
No one forgot. This is why no one flocked to Bernie, Jack--you lie and sensationalize.
Do you remember the fucking Panama Papers?
Just white people things~
So brave
No
Same thing happened in 2008 but on a much larger scale and only one person went to jail lol
Y'all remember until a couple years ago when insider trading was literally legal for these bribed out whores? 

In a real country, politicians who get rich off of human suffering would be dragged from their houses and curb-stomped
Do you wash your hands and face
Yes, I remember this repost from yesterday and the day before and two days before that...

Do you people not know what an investigation is? Or how long it takes?
I dunno what you expect to be honest.  As long as politicians are allowed to trade stock (which will always be the case) they will sell when they learn a crash is most likely coming.  I mean do you think their thought process should be "stocks will fall after we make this announcement but I'll sit here with my thumb up my ass because it's ethical"?  Anyone on this sub who trades would have done the same thing had they been in their shoes.
Didn’t forget. What are we gonna do about it, though? Seriously.
Do you really expect the 350 million slaves to this plutocracy to suddenly notice their chains? We've got Disney+ now! You ask too much.
Sure I remember but what do I do about it?
Insider trading is when you have insider knowledge. We all knew about covid
Did I hear wrong that they were throw in jail pretty fast for this?

&#x200B;

Is this any different than the ones that get stock in the defense contractors as a war is being ramped up?
And yet, Martha Stewart’s 5 month conviction for the exact same thing wasn’t forgotten for years. Go figure.
Do you knkw how fast you were going
These are the real conspiracies. They should all be jailed. But people are to caught up on red herring like 5g and qanon.  We are to blame
Not sure... I remember when Epstein didn't kill himself. That any good?
As long as they have you all saying the greatest country in the world, nothing will change.
On the other hand, if you paid attention to the news in January then you would have known that this pandemic was only getting worse and spreading globally. If you didn't think the stock market would crash from this I don't know what to tell you
Not letting your life savings get wiped out is not the same thing as profiting. The thing that was BS was some of the same senators turning around and telling citizens that everything is fine and there is nothing to worry about.
This whole damn country better remember! Will someone please start a petition with this on it? (Amongst the other 100s of Illegal activities committed by our “elected officials” -ALL OF THEM! 
I’d like to see these congressmen and women be audited by the IRS and to be charged with insider trading. If not now SEC -then when???? Or FINRA or any other letter agency for that matter.

Long past “the land of the free”.   We’ve become nothing more than collateral for the rich.  And if we’re somehow able to eek out a living, congratulations.  Every single day we witness criminal behavior by those “elected” to “represent” us yet nobody EVER pays for their crimes in DC.  There TRULY does need to be a mass revolution by us “pee-ons” to take our country and OUR wealth back.  But that’ll never happen.  They do too well of a job keeping the ignorant masses divided and fighting.
The best thing about intentionally leaving problems for the common people to stress about is the fact that now we don't have time to stress about this
The elite do it everyday.. who cares?
These people clearly did a shitty thing, but as always I don’t see how these politicians will ever be held accountable. Even if they’re dragged to court (unlikely, I predict they’ll get at most a public wrist slap) they’ll just claim that the incoming pandemic was public knowledge, which it was, and that they had the foresight to sell, even if they were following the President in saying the exact opposite at the time. The law doesn’t ban trading on public knowledge, no matter what was coming out of their mouths.
I member
Member berries remember...
So with the Smith/Mundt act change in 2012 where it is legal to lie and create propaganda they can also do insider trading. Next they will be able to occupy a country without declaring war, using a lie, kill hundreds of thousands, and then say "Oops!", and then keep occupying said country without pushback or investigation. Oh…right… this is a frequent thing.
Of insider trading “scandals” people selling shit after we locked down travel from China doesn’t register on the scale.
I am ready to applaud whoever takes some f'n ACTION against these monsters.
I mean, insider trading is completely legal for congressmen.
Are they covering their shorts already? Anyone knows?

Funny that they never seem to mention stop buying cheap chinese goods schlepped half way across the world only to be sold for $1.50 in Walmart. Cheap ocean freight is not only a disaster for the environment, but also our own low-skilled jobs sector.
Reminder that the idea of a personal carbon footprint was an advertisement campaign pushed by bp oil in the wake of the oil spill.
Dont forget to recycle! or else its your fault

*less than 10% of all plastic has ever been recycled*

(edit: meaning that regardless if people recycle or not, it doesnt get done by the people we are trusting to do it because its not profitable)
Wanna hear something just as bad?   The company I work for has recycling bins all throughout. However, both trash and recycling goes into the same dumpster outside. So in reality its all a big farce.
John Oliver did a good show a few weeks ago about recycling, which basically boils down to corporations creating tons and tons of plastic waste which is often difficult or impossible to recycle, and then putting the responsibility to take care of it on the consumer.
Another YUGE polluter is the US military, but they somehow always forget that part too.
One prime cause of the pollution is planned obsolescence.  Thing are made to fail. Philips led bulbs for Dubai has 16 1watt led and each led is driven at 0.25 watts. That bulb has life of more than 30 years of continuous  use. While the same bulb for rest of the world only has 4 LEDs  and they are driven at full capacity.  Thus they fail in about  a year or two.

Planned obsolescence  is a very shitty way to create jobs and economy.
The 100 corporations being responsible for 71% fun fact is pretty misleading, as it's including all of what their customers downstream are burning, the emissions of the companies themselves are ~9% of that 71%. It's also only counting greenhouse gases from/related to oil/gas/coal, not including emissions from agriculture or anything not fossil fuel. Read the report for yourself https://www.cdp.net/en/reports/downloads/1800
Yeah, swapping my once every 2 or 3 year plane ride will save the world. While I completely understand taking steps at home I’m tired of the media’s focus on the little people. Maybe if they started “outing” these large corporations us little people can work to change them and not our microscopic footprints.
Is that list if 100 companies readily available?

Edit:  Never mind I found it. In my quick skimming of the list it looked like about 1 in 5 are US companies.

The main contributing industry as far as atmospheric pollution goes, by a LONG shot, is animal agriculture. Raising animals (and the crops that feed these animals) is not only extremely taxing to our atmosphere, but also has tons of other downstream effects, such as:

- Fertilizer/manure runoff into streams, lakes, and even the ocean, causing eutrophication

- Razing of rainforest and other essential ecosystems to make room for cattle farms

- Illness in humans from meat-heavy diets and risk of disease outbreaks among farmed animals

- Animal welfare concerns (I'm not even vegan or vegetarian, eat meat every week, but there is no denying that the abuse these farm animals undergo is horrific)

- Overfishing in the ocean which has too many cascading effects to capture in a single reddit comment

- Water usage for animal agriculture is off the charts. Thousands of gallons of water just to produce a couple burgers' worth of meat


This is the real conspiracy imo. A vast majority of the green/environmental groups across the world will give the typical advice to drive less, use energy efficient appliances, etc. Which are not bad suggestions. But they ultimately are drops in the bucket compared to a strong recommendation to eliminate meat and fish from our diets. 

Lol, end rant. To clarify, I eat meat, am not a vegan or vegetarian. Just recently red pilled on this issue.
[deleted]
But....if enough people make said changes, they change the demand of those products and therefore changes the supply that is needed to be output by some of those 100 corporations.

FWIW, dude's right, doesn't address the root cause, but we also can't pretend we shouldn't do anything because we are not the root cause.
Stop buying their fucking products then lol. Just because you don't make plastic bags, doesn't  mean you have to use them. Just because you don't have a pig farm, doesn't mean you have to eat porkchops. Nothing will get better with such brush it off not my business not my fault mentalities.
Eating less meat, keeping your thermostat reasonable, and traveling by public transport more are all good ideas that everyone should do anyway.

What never gets mentioned by media is that the fashion industry is the 2nd, arguably the 1st, biggest polluter of the planet. They dump so much garbage and chemicals into the water every day it's insane. Yet every woke person I see has the coolest new clothes and shoes and buys new shit every year. YOURE HYBRID CAR WONT STOP YOUR VANITY FROM POISONING THE PLANET! That goes double for celebrities that pretend to give a shit but still have fashion and shoe lines.
And who are those 100 companies catering to? Its us. Most of the companies are either producing junk for us, shipping that junk to us, or variations thereof. The original tweet missed the point but it’s not incorrect. Avoiding meat and voting with your wallet and purchasing sustainable goods is the best and most effective way to fight climate change other than legislation.
“The NGOs — from the **Club of Rome** to the Friends of the Earth, the World Wildlife Fund, Aspen Institute, and Worldwatch Institute — all began a concerted international campaign, especially among university students, to attack industrial society as evil and population growth as a cancer, and to demand a shift to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind as the “solution” to the end of the era of oil. **By maintaining control of the grassroots environmental movement’s agenda, the NGOs could maintain control of the outcome,** making sure it didn’t threaten fundamental oil interests. **The motive of the Rockefellers’ new concern for the planet’s ecology was that only they — and not the general population - would define what was meant by ‘ecology’ and identify who was to blame for problems linked to it.**

As part of their “Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars” agenda of global social engineering, they began propagandizing the scientifically-unsubstantiated notion that carbon emissions such as from oil-fuelled cars or coal power plants — manmade emissions of C02 — were creating a new threat to the future of the planet—’Global Warming.’ It was the same Malthusian austerity agenda of the wealthy circles around the Rockefeller circles and the circles of the 1001 A Nature Trust, dressed up in new guise. 

**While pollution remained a genuine problem, the idea that it was ‘warming’ the climate was a fabrication.**

The cofounder of the **Club of Rome** and founding member of 1001 A Nature Trust, **Dr Alexander King admitted the essential fraud some years later in his book, The First Global Revolution. He stated: In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill**... All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. **The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.”**

“The question one had to ask was, why would the leading figures in the world of AngloAmerican oil and the banking establishment create and finance a movement ostensibly aimed at reducing industrial growth and ultimately lowering consumption of petroleum? 

The answer was not so obvious. As then Secretary of State **Henry Kissinger purportedly said** at the time of the launch of the global ecology NGOs during the mid-1970s, **“If you control the oil you can control entire nations or groups of nations.”** ^24  It is also worth noting that by hammering away the message of “humanity” as “the real enemy,” the corporate world, **by sleight of hand, 
effectively diverted attention away from itself and onto ordinary people.**

For David Rockefeller’s circles, oil had become far more than a source of personal or even corporate riches. It had become the effective throttle or controller of the entire world economy. If certain powerful interests were able to control that throttle — either turning on the fuel or shutting it down — they essentially would be able to control the fate of nations and of world geopolitics. That was the Rockefeller agenda in the 1970s. How it unfolded in the ensuing decades would define wars and world economic crises in ways few could even 
dimly perceive. Crises and perceptions were being deliberately manipulated by a 
powerful few, using oil or lack of it as the throttle of their world power.”

I've seen this stat around. My mom's pretty bought into the guilt trip, is there a link about this I can read?
Imagine how much less pollution and waste there’d be if there weren’t any factories making processed food and the plastic bags to package them.
Wait, r/conspiracy believes in global warming??
Pic said it best. CNN is the personification of malpractice.
Manufacturing corporations invented the litterbug. You and I being a litterbug – or not disposing of the litter in the right way, shifts responsibility from the creator of garbage to the consumer of garbage. Why are you littering? 

The carbon footprint was invented by British Petroleum. Again, it shifts blame from the makers of climate change to the consumer. "What are you doing to help climate change?" 

We don't ask, why aren't corporations responsible for garbage – they almost were going to be in the 1960s, and why do we let oil and gas pollute so much?
As long as there are more than 1/3 of those mentioned corporations sponsored media and CNN they're going to keep telling us to eat less meat and ride bicycle to work.
Smart thermostats do not save you any money. They are a nice interface... That is it. They do not change the operation of the unit AT ALL. Any change you do make to the operation is not going to be because you have a fancy thermostat.

Occupancy sensing is the only point I can really understand and that is only going to do so much considering the temperature curve your space has to overcome to rebound from the change caused by your absence.
This is so f*cking true! 
Ok to be fair, I still try to live a relatively eco-friendly life, on the principle of simply caring about my closest environment. BUT holy shit do I hate it when the media is trying to play the moral card towards the little guy all the damn time! 
Uh no, 99% of us are not responsible for this shit, and we don't have the actual power to make a huge change within a short time...BUT the industries/billion dollar businesses who cause it most definitely do.

But of course it's just easier to pester regular ppl instead of governments and powerful conglomerates ://
oh yes, those corporations that pollute for no reason at all.  

It's not our demand that makes them do that.  
It's not our unwillingness to push for green regulations that let's them do it.  
It's not our responsibility at all.  

If we use less fossil fuels, Shell and BP will reduce their emmisions.  
If we buy less shit from overseas, those corps will emmit less for transport.  
If we see a corporation shitting on our planet beyond reason, we must punish them.  

We consumers are responsible.
They will literally fund a campaign trying to convince poor people to eat bugs before they address the economy.
Wow finally an actual conspiracy that has real consequences posted here.  It's the same as plastics.  These corporations switched over to plastics for profit than put millions into antilittering advertising to put the onice on the consumers.

Eating less meat and using public transportation literally reduces the need from those 100 corporations lol
Ahh yes, they want us to think it’s the responsibility of the common man to fix the damage done by the industrial revolution..

Silly bastards.
What bus ? What train? Yea if you don’t live in a metro area you have neither option.
No one points out that if the masses rallied and destroyed the 1% that it would do far more good for the planet. Off-set your carbon, eat the rich.
And exactly how much are they worth, how much profit they all make, the average cost of an employees hourly wage per company, and then how much in taxes these 100 companies paid, bonus point in looking at what percentage of their product impact the environment both chemically (pollution) and physically (non-degradable trash(plastics, etc))
Also I have no bus line or train that runs near my house. So to save the earth I need to walk 10 miles a day to get to a bus stop? and the only train near me is about 50 miles. This is ridiculous. 

Also some purple cannot afford a smart thermostat or they rent and cannot just change things in their apartment
Don't forget the military, one of the biggest contributors to climate change in the US.
Not to mention not using plastic *doesn't make plastic not exist.* It's literally a toxic byproduct of oil. But I guess the less said about that the better right?
Yes, this is what I've been saying! Stop making consumers feel guilty...it's the corporations that should be responsible for their impact on the environment. Our government should be holding them responsible..recycling was invented to protect companies and put guilt on consumers.
Reminder that cnn and many other main stream media outlets are just mouthpieces for those  corporations.
"Take shorter showers" is the one that always gets me. Like, there are so few moments of personal refuge left in the world. You want me to reduce my shower from 5 minutes to 2 minutes, to save the planet? Get bent.
GOT EM! xD
Corporations don't make greenhouse gasses for shits and giggles. They are supplying a demand.
Guess what corporations need? Customers

Reducing one's individual dependencies on meat and fossil fuels will invariably reduce those emissions by reducing demand.
Por que no los dos?

I (gladly) eat meat because when I don't I get tired FAST and can't do my job properly. (Edit: I have sincerely tried).

The fucks are delusional.
i mean, why don't we personally take responsibility for our impacts on the environment _and_ push for corporate emission reform? it's not an either/or situation - you can do both.
I think both are right tbh. The 'individual' responsibility is similar to a boycott. If we can change the demand, we can change what the corporations do.

(It is definitely a slower and less effective process than regulating the companies hough)

At 25,000 tons per ship, that is 520 shiploads a year.

Plus it is far easier to put scrubbers on ships stacks, than it is to squeeze every single little savings out of our cars (which has made the cars less reliable and more expensive to work on). But, Billionaires own boats, screw the little people.
It'll be a cold day in hell when you see any of these rich cannibal vermin like Bill Gates taking a bus!

Presenting it as an individual failure is not journalistic malpractice. It’s actually a purposeful campaign launched by BP in order to shift responsibility from corporations to individuals.

([Good link about this](https://theconversation.com/amp/climate-change-focusing-on-how-individuals-can-help-is-very-convenient-for-corporations-108546) since I can’t find the original one about BP I was looking for.)￼
DOD and the Pentagon are the USA #1 producer of pollution. I can’t find the source but it’s widely available.
Leo DiCaprio, brilliant actor but one thing I cannot stand about him is how he constantly lectures people on Climate Change when he himself own a collection of private jets.
It's almost as if the system is broken
Don't worry, they'll just pay a carbon tax and continue polluting because they can afford it. 

Meanwhile, you need to bend over.
Trash journalism
Swap the car or plane for a bus or train???? This fucker has clearly never done though the time intensive frustration of bus logistics, and has no clue of how much more expensive train tickets are compared to anything else.


Ergo this translates to: "want to save the planet? Waste all your free time and spend all your money."
Meh, if I’m looking for “things I can do”, becoming CEO of a major corporation and holding my job long enough to change their environmental impact (without being fired by investors) isn’t really one of the things I can do.
Hold them accountable like how? Strengthen the EPA? Exercise social responsibility in purchasing and consumption habits, decreasing the profitability of dirty industry? Tax polluting industries and use that money to protect the environment? Hell yeah, I'm on board.
It's a bit frustrating when people say "I don't buy plastic bags, to help the planet"... You know it won't stop the production of them? They'll keep being made whether you buy them or not. It's really sad, because I know that we all want to do our part for the environment, but we have to switch our attention over to these large corporations.
Pretty much every one of the 100 are gas, oil and coal companies.

Not saying we should give them a free pass but what else are they meant to do? Just stop producing energy? 

All three of the suggestions come down to reducing our energy consumption - that is literally the only way WE can make these 100 companies from producing less emissions... by giving them a reason to NOT produce so much energy. Well that and getting behind renewables.

Yeah it would be great if the fishing industry stopped raping our oceans too...
I didn't view the tweet as announcing individuals' moral failings as the culprit. I took it literally as here is what you, as an individual, can do. I checked out [the report](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240) out of curiosity and at the top of the list were several coal companies, and gas companies. So the advice to drive less and take mass transit when possible would be helpful. The animal agriculture industry is well known to be awful for our planet, so eating less or no meat would help combat the climate destruction of the animal agriculture industry by reducing demand and by consequence their activity/footprint.
Why not both?
Theres a meet-me-halfway element to this. 

Yes, planes pollute. But there would be less plane trips with less demand. Cars pollute. But people like cars, are resistant to change, continue to move further away from their job, hate dense living and hate expensive gas prices. 

Individuals are *not* absolved of pollution statistics. Individuals are also voters with the ability to vote for policies that are more sustainable.
I think asking people (and I think soon it may become coercing and forcing) to reduce their meat consumption is unreasonable. Rather, we should try to innovate on the production of meat or carbon-neutral/reductive to produce replacements for it that are sufficiently nutritious  or otherwise attractive in taste and cooking versatility as to lower the aggregate demand for it. I dunno if cheap meat culture cloning might be a thing one day? Would make the vegan activists happy too.
If they really gave a shit about the environment or health they would ban plastic. Ever hear about that? No and you never will alternatives are slightly more expensive for big companies. And plastic is toxic to drink out of.
Unpopular opinion: if you ACTUALLY care about it, you're probably doing some of these things. Saying "well they don't give a fuck, so I won't either!" Doesn't help anyone. 

Some hippie once said something about casting the first stone, and I'm getting a goddamn Tesla stone thrower.
Fuck the corporation's they own the news teams man they want to keep us and hold us responsible make us change to help the companies keep making money save said money not pay tax and keep the money for their scumbag families and friends and the elite
Imagine when they finally have to accept that they didn't have 80 million people cornered in, it was the other way around.
46% of plastic in the ocean is from the commercial fishing industry
Cargo ships produce more greenhouse gases than every car in the world combined..

Scroll conspiracy to see at least 2 whiny 'why won't the msm cover X' stories that informed people already knew. It's even lazier than saying 'ive done the research' because you literally did none!
Rules for thee,not for me
I will not eat less meat fu
These corporations do what they do because individuals pay them to.
If you actually read the study that claims this, the #1 polluting “corporation” is the entire country of China. Just a tad misleading.
Who do you think buys the goods and services from those companies. It is everyone’s responsibility to cut back.
There's a reason why Big Oil is so eager to promote the idea of a personal carbon footprint.
They should rename all of MSM as “journalistic malpractice.”
The Iceland boss- the company who take Findus, Youngs, Captain Birdseye then contract them to make Iceland branded food despite the wasted packaging - calls out wasted packaging and blames the consumer:  
[https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/iceland-boss-says-potholes-litter-19957256](https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/iceland-boss-says-potholes-litter-19957256)
Who are the customers of 71% of corporations?
did the same thing in 1971 with Keep America Beautiful (Crying Indian) campaign.  it was funded by the soda companies telling us "people start pollution. people can stop it."
How about stop supporting these companies then? Stop buying meat from massive farms, stop buying coca cola, stop using airlines. They are only responsible for all this pollution because people buy what they're selling.

But no, I saw this one tweet screenshot on Reddit so I'll keep eating meat guilt free and won't give a shit about the ethics of what I'm buying or where I'm buying from. Quit blaming other people for climate change when everyone plays their part to cause it, not just 'acshually it's corporations not people'.
I’ll start doing these things when all the politicians and all the celebrities who claim to care about the environment start doing them.
Plus the meat thing is fake. Its ****** at so many levels
... They just want us weak
The scariest thing about this post to me is that CNN is still in business because people actually listen to them and believe their garbage nonsense.
CNN: Americans should live in the dark, take cold showers, have abortions for the Earth

China, India: whatever bro
And, eat 30% less meat (15 days to curb the spread)... Becomes NO meat (1 year into global shutdown)
Well you're reading CNN, so ....
They're right. I can't go to the CNN building and turn off the lights. So if I want to make MY part, I should do these three thibgs they say.

No journalistic malpractice here, just dumb reading
oh look, journalists are being lying scum, again.
Also correct me if I'm wrong but the earth tends to self correct?

We had massive amounts of co2 in the past, and then suddenly had a huge oxygenation event. Followed by gradual co2 adjustments to raise the temp.  

I may be stubborn, but for people who care about the planet and want to reduce human impact, they sure are doing a lot to try to control it and maintain the current status quo.
Reminder that BP invented and marketed the whole concept of carbon footprint to shift the blame.
Swapping my car for a train then!
This is like going to jail for hiring a hitman to murder someone for you, then complaining that you are being charged as an individual when it was a hitman who committed the crime.
Reminder that while 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, no one has stopped buying their products.
"Other people/companies are worse, that means I dont have to do anything!"

That is what you sound like. Look I despise CNN for a lot of reasons. This tweet is not one of them. 

Just because other people are doing bad things on a larger scale than you, does not mean you can shift all the blame to them. 

If consumers demand action from these companies that puts pressure on them to change. Use your wallet to support companies that care about the planet and dont support the ones that dont. Combine that with your own acts towards the environment and accept that you have done as much as you can. 

Keep the pressure on these companies and our politicians up. That means stop voting for anyone who is GOP and many of the DEMS who dont care either. 

Your GOP vote does more damage to the environment than you realize.
Reminder that as a first worlder the best thing you can do for the environment is not have kids. If you have kids then none of the things listed above will ever get you even close to carbon neutral.
Oh and #FuckCNN #FuckMassMedia
This CNN post is brought to you by the CCP.  All hail our overlord Xi Jinping.
Well its CNN, what degree of journalistic integrity are you expecting?
While we're at it, let's remember who votes against environmental regulations so that those companies can continue to pollute without consequence.
Good question

Not sure if the McCains were on the flight logs but Cindy McCain said:

"Epstein was hiding in plain sight," said Cindy McCain. "We all knew about him. We all knew what he was doing, but we had no one that was — no legal aspect that would go after him. They were afraid of him. For whatever reason, they were afraid of him."

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cindy-mccain-admits-we-all-knew-about-epstein
Not for nothing, but if their names are on the flight logs they are most definitely a part of an ongoing investigation and would not be able to discuss it to the public without some kind of legal backlash.

Keep that in mind.
Here's the thing: (I know nothing, I am not connected to anyone - this is pure conjecture based on what I, and everyone else, knows from media reports)

I think Epstein was one of those “I can get you *anything* you want” kind of guys. Drugs? Sex grannies? Little people dressed up like cherubs feeding grapes to people in leather gimp suits? I bet he did it all, and he probably kept really good records in case he ever needed a favor later on. And I'm sure a subset of that included underage girls. But I also don't think it was *all underage girls, all the time*.

There were probably crazy drug-fueled sex parties at the island that nobody really wants to talk about, but that doesn't mean they are all pedophiles. Again, **I think some of them definitely were.** But if I'm a treasured national celebrity, and I put on a gorilla costume and jerked off while watching my wife blow a guy dressed up like a coal miner, I probably don't want that coming out. I'm probably going to keep my mouth shut, even though I've done nothing illegal.

I believe that's why we're seeing so much silence from people involved. Everyone has kinks that they may or may not consider shameful, but I don't think everyone's kink violates the law. I believe, in fact, that was probably a relatively small minority of Epstein's clientele, so I don't think it's especially fair to tar and feather everyone, even if they went to parties on the island. 

I'm sure Clinton did some dirty stuff on that island. Probably Trump, too. But they both strike me as more of the “snorting cocaine off a Colombian hooker’s ass,” or “handcuff me to a bed and spank me with a magazine that features my face on the cover” type offenses. I’m a bit less optimistic about Prince Andrew and Les Wexner, and I'm sure there are others who broke those “half your age plus seven” rule. But that doesn't mean there are hundreds of pedophiles running around. Probably just hundreds of people with things to hide.

Finally, Epstein **definitely** didn’t kill himself.
I mean, if I had unknowingly traveled on his plane at some point, I'd contact the FBI. I wouldn't make a public tweet.
It's one big club...and you aint in it!

Speaking as a lawyer: everyone on his flight logs are wealthy, sophisticated parties who have experience managing public relations and the media, and who surely have attorneys on long-term retainer and have long since been advised to say absolutely nothing on the matter one way or the other. Anything else would just be inviting trouble.
It is coming from the mouth of an abuser but she isn't wrong.
Well remember the Oscars, the host(Ricky Gervais) saying all those pedo "jokes" and shit? he was right you can see their faces reactions like "yes that shit is all true... Hehe 😬".
How come we don’t hear much from those celebrities? When is there going to be any accountability? I’m not saying every single one is guilty right off the bat... but it’s sure odd how quiet pedowood is
Formula one racer Eddie Irvine talked about being there. He sounds quite genuine about not knowing about any illegal activities.  

https://nypost.com/2020/08/04/eddie-irvine-bill-clinton-and-i-partied-at-epstein-bash/

I think all celebs on the list should come forward though. Silence is damning.
I wish them well
Once you get caught as a pedo your entire contacts list on your phone are now pedos
It's *probably* because they're all guilty of raping kids.
Because the "list" with all the celebrity names has no proof behind it. They have Epstein's logs up till 2005 and people like Tom Hanks don't show up. Funny enough trump does though.
It's even stranger that the media, for the most part, hasn't followed up after having the flight logs of who were on the flights to the island. Where's the "Excuse me... the flight logs show you went to Epstein's island... what do you have to say?"

Nope... hasn't happened. Anyone want to guess WHY?
beyoncé was there like tf she doing there
I’m thinking everyone would attack them for virtue signalling and I doubt anyone would actually trust that it’s a genuine apology. They’re definitely safer just saying nothing, brining no attention to themselves. I’m not saying it’s right, I’m just also not surprised in the slightest.
Wasn't a question
They have their orders.
It's all getting weird and random nobody has anything to say about the wrongs in the world but all seem to want to accuse us of killing Granny.
And Ghrislane who is in custody has not had a mugshot released-
Looked at her twitter and she types like black people are an alien race
It's pretty obvious why... No Celeb wants to admit to being anywhere near Jeff.
They will become hated amongst the celeb inner circle..
That’s uhhh not a question
The key is to say you didn't know him.
Don’t forget Ellen pao’s comments about knowing that ghislaine was trafficking children, yet no one did anything about it.
Nor have any of them come out and said save the children, instead, we have them talking about how are president is an ass, and how people that do t wear masks are assholes. I wish they held the same amount of rage for the children they’re trafficking and raping and sacrificing! For anyone who knows who micheal rappenport is, he is a great example of what I’m talking about.  Everyday he comes out with a new video on tik tok absolutely descimating the president about his horrible response to the virus, and about him not wearing a mask, but not one word about anyone’s behavior when it comes to the issue of trafficking children, their well being, and the fact it’s the number one crime in America and around the globe! Pathetic! And believe me, he is not the only one, but a consistent one.  I have come to really view these people that have platforms very differently I’ve the last 6 months.
msm is very gentle not to ask them any awkward questions about it.
How criminal organizations get what they want:

Threat of violence

Threat of dying

Threat of loss

Threat of exposure

Threat of dishonoring

All of these can pretty much be summed up as Blackmail.

You don't take a bribe? Well, your family is gonna get beaten. Don't have a family? You'll get beaten. Have too much security? You're gonna get exposed. Haven't done anything shady? You will be framed for something. Still don't care? Killing you is always an option, even in the middle of the court, if needed.
It is quite an interesting point considering how much those fools screech about other things. Just remember the uncomfortable laughs at Ricky Gervias monologue
If your running a pedophile ring why would you even have a flight log on your passengers

Trump said something.

Unfortunately it was "I hope she's doing well"
Weinstein spoke out in favor of Time’s Up. This is an investigation. I would mistrust anyone making public statements. 

“Thou doth protest too much.”
100% agree with this tweet but it should be known Nicole Arbour does not care. She just does things to troll people online or play to an audience for clout
Chris tucker was on that plane with Clinton and I haven't heard shit
I posted about how eminem was on there and his lyrics from guilty conscious were really telling and nobody gave af.
Been awhile since conspiracy made the front page. I think we can all agree this is a worthy thing to promote, good job.
I think at this point if you ever were on the flight log innocent or guilty you'd rather just stay in that ditch rather than put your head above it.

No one in the world would believe that you had no idea and everyone would assume u were part of it
They're........ social distancing


🤐
Because they haven’t done so publicly, that doesn’t mean people haven’t offered information to law enforcement. Perhaps speaking publicly would jeopardise ongoing investigations. 
This isn’t a gotcha. Next.
All while the President of the United States continues to dangle a pardon for Epstein’s #1 accomplice. Weird.
Ashton Kutcher 

He has been fighting human trafficking and sexual slavery for YEARS
Because the "flight log" circulating on the webs and twitters is fake fake fake.  
There actually is a flight log that was published years ago and can be viewed here: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html)
Not to mention, the anti trump rhetoric out of the Hollywood crowd has been painfully silent over the last month.
Most of Hollywood is left leaning, those who were close friends with Epstein were left leaning, the left are in a current ploy to try and take power. Hollywood will stay quiet over this to ease the wound that won't heal for the left.
They wouldn't want to continue the link between them and the place?

And they may be cooperating now and it would be better for the case for the people they are informing on to not know?

And maybe they are afraid of being suicided...........

This is just anti hollywood nonsense lol.

Being on the flight log ain't shit. There was a lot of parties thrown at that place, and a lot of people came through that didn't know Epstein as anything other than a hedge fund manager with a shit-ton of money.

If you are going to look at people, look at the people with multiple contacts in his black book. That was his personal Rolodex that also included entries for all the 'massage' girls.

That document is out there floating around. Go fucking find it.
Yes its odd but keep in mind y'all don't know how private jets or flight logs work either. Epstein's jet was making him money by flying around when he wasn't using it. People go to airport and want a private flight and they get one. They don't ask who owns the jet. No one tells them who owns the jet. They just get on it for a couple hours and get off at their destination. Finding out later that the guy who owned it is a scumbag doesn't compel you to some sort of call to action anymore than if I learned the CEO of Hyundai has sex slaves in his basement.
It's unsettling.  When George Fluid was died and the protests, BLM they were falling over each other with social media support and outrage.

...but sex trafficking, with children and things worse...crickets and tumbleweeds

I mean, people were and still are in fear of being murdered. I would imagine that this goes deeper than we can ever picture, still so much to reveal, anyone on that list who decides to speak up will be silenced I believe. I think a lot of people who went there were going there to visit a celebrity party or what not, not knowing what was truly going on and they might’ve been purposely let aware of what was going on once they got there and then threatened and made to understand that they must keep quiet and that tabs would be kept on them. I feel like them doing that is a way to put blame on the whole industry because everyone who is actually innocent would keep their mouths closed out of fear, hiding the deepest darkest secret. I just don’t believe that everyone on those flight logs was involved with the fucked up shit, I’d be surprised. Plus a lot of celebrities went only one time and never returned, others went over a dozen times. It’s just all so fucking crazy.
Anyone got that list handy? We need to build a few memes with it.
I really feel as though any celebrity who did come out to say that exact same thing would have all of the exact same people accusing them of trying to cover for themselves.

&#x200B;

Just sayin'
They fuck kids, and their PR agent is helping them hide this fact
A lot of people were brought to that island solely for blackmail purposes. They’re still scum for not doing shit about it though
Why aren’t the parents of these girls ever seen as complacent in all of this. Hell I want to know every person my kid knows until he’s 18. That’s just par for the course. Who the fuck let’s they’re kids go with some person doing whatever at 17 or younger.  The parents are responsible in all of this as well. But people seem to be ok with that. And that’s pretty telling.
Lmao how would this sub react if that happened. Actually some people have made statements like that and they basically hold no water for people here.
I think it’s pretty obvious their legal reps would have told them to stay silent until an investigation is underway. Doesn’t take a genius to figure that one out.
Help with what?  It's not a charity drive, ut's an investigation.  Celebrities and politicians who went to his parties and on his plane and shit either didn't fuck any kids and only knew what the public at large basically knew (but what the courts couldn't completely make a case for) or they fucked kids and don't want to talk to investigators because they'll go to jail.
Guilty people get really quiet. Innocent tend to protest. Not a peep from so many....and dead Epstein who did not kill himself....
It's almost as if they all are blackmailed to hell.
How about that reddit account
Homies that why
Not strange at all. If you are engaging in illegal activity you usually don't get real public and try to play dumb. You know you are under investigation.
They've got millions and millions but they didn't give a cent to help the victims sue.

GUILTY.
Because that’s basically throwing yourself on a grenade no matter if you’re innocent or not?
I think these people know the media is controlled by the same crowd.. So anyone who truly speaks out is eliminated and their story isn't broadcasted across the world like the movies make you believe it would be.
That was a comment written by me in the link you provided... I appreciate the tips without being snarky.. It’s weird you think you are trying to prove something without proving anything... As long as you’re having fun between looking at child porn and eating ranch dressing; just don’t hurt yourself.
One of them even became president, and has the power of the Justice Department behind him. But wishes G Maxwell well. It’s disgusting, dirty, and wrong.
I know instead the celeb wished his wife well. Like who in the actual fuck does that?
I hear what you are saying, and it is alleged.. How do you explain frazzle drip and adrenochrome? Please look into this and get back with me. Why are the New York cops who have watched the frazzledrip video now dead?
This whole thing seems to have been brushed under the rug with the c19 thing
They obviously want people to forgot about them being involved whatsoever, and remove themselves from the situation - hoping we'll forget.
Bill Gates response in an interview was so what he's dead? He's not even trying to hide it just say yeah we already took care of that problem.
What is also suspect is with all the accusations which would be subject to libel, defamation or slander lawsuit possibilities if false ... crickets! If I were innocent and facing ridicule I would fight back. And maybe retire on the proceeds.
Being a hollywood star means you have suck dicks to get that role or position. No one is going to come out and then risk the chance of people finding out that they were also involved in that same shady shit. emma watson included.

This is a dumb point. There is a federal investigation happening, we don't know who may or many not be cooperating. Considering how highly connected many of the people in this investigation are, it's also entirely understandable that they wouldn't want their name out there as assisting the investigation.
They're all still out there pushing the liberal agenda.
And trump is wishing maxwell well...
[deleted]
Hillary how do you feel about the accusations against your husband?
Not trying to defend them, but if a celeb came out and said this, they would immediately put a target on their back.
Person dies by police brutality (which is bad) Every celeb makes an “I’m sorry” video.

Pedo sex rings exposed, every celeb-crickets.
Those kind of questions cause cars to crash through guardrails and people winding up in suitcases. Lots of suicides as well, truth be told.

  


They know you know. But you do NOT have permission to go after any of them. The way they killed Epstein made it clear that no one who values being alive should pursue it.

  


Prince whatever was offered up to force his retirement from the public and punish the royal family. Also conveniently a notable public figure to be accused, but not directly in charge of anything nor does he have any real power to lose.
The media buried this one fast.
This is actually a VERY good point!
All the evidence you need.
Looking at you, Chris Tucker!
Even though it's an open investigation we all know absolutely nothing is going to come out of this. Why has ex POTUS Clinton not been questioned yet? Or any of the other known associates especially any of the people that visited the island. Bureaucratic red tape everywhere to protect everyone that was involved. 

USA you are disgusting, we are supposed to be setting the example when it comes to how we punish those that break the law. But in this country it is evident that the rich are above the law.
I'm fed up of this. I'll prepare for down votes. 

A guy I grew up with, a stepson of my father's friend, turned out to be a peadophile. He was caught watching child pornography. Now he's locked up. 

We weren't really friends in the sense of we actively hung out, but we hung out when our dads got together for BBQs, parties or drinks. He was a normal guy and over the years we hung out at least 8 to 10 times a year until I was about 16. 

Now, there's tonnes of photos of us together, homevideo etc...

Everyone who has ever been associated with Epstein, pictured, seen or vacationed with him has now been accused of being a child molester. 

I don't ever tell anyone this. Now this thread is accusing anyone associated with Epstein who is silent as complicit. I would rather just forget about him and never talk about him again.
theyre too busy raping children
Because they were too busy being balls deep in kids
Probably because any speaking up or out about it would only draw attention.

Not to mention death threats from morons who think Tom Hanks is involved or that ordering a pizza is something only pedophiles do
Because they are all guilty as hell
Lol nah they just move to Greece
They have assistants, agents, and a public relations team who decide every critical decision or plan. There are two main ways of dealing controversy as a celebrity. 

1) ignore it completely, act clueless and naive to the allegations, absolutely say nothing in regards to the matter, and pray the storm passes you or goes on to someone else bigger. 

2) make a very calculated and careful statement pleading your case and apologize if you had harmed anyone unknowingly (but not to the actual allegation or charge), pledge to make yourself a better person and devote your life to blah blah blah, play the victim and say you are sad or depressed, make public appearances in very popular shows or get support from other celebrities,
Plausible Deniability, people use fake names all the time, and celebrities probably use them the most to avoid the public.   Which is about as useful as the The Dunning-Kruger Effect, I'm awesome.
Who were the celebrities?
Can I see the list,? I just wanna read it
Its only strange if you expected that they all weren't pedophiles ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Maybe look at the flight logs there’s heaps
She is a gem
Many have actually.
I was thinking the exact thing!!!!!
I imagine a lot of celebrities are afraid to speak out. You think if a Celeb elected to speak out that the other people of power that are heavily involved wouldn’t have them silenced?
They have attorneys....
No one wants to be the first celeb to speak out, once one does the rest will follow.
And Eminem’s on the list, what a surprise.
Thats just one of her funny "jokes"
You done good Nicole, you've done something relevant
Dershowitz tried to XD
Well because they probably all knew
History has shown us, and them, over and over, that the best and only course of action is to keep your mouth shut.

Nothing good will come from talking about it.
Kek .¿?
maybe they cant due to investigations? I'm not sure

Look at who's tweeting it. Nicole Arbour a couple years back was accused of abusing her partner, a YouTuber named Matthew Santoro
A lot of them were busy with Weinstein.
Good looks🙏🏼 can’t push me.
Fact check?
Better question: how did you make me read?
She is completely right but i dont believe she js genuine. She is doing anything ti regain the relevance and following she lost after her topless vid got out
Hell, one guy was on a lawsuit with the guy. But at least “nobody likes him”
Upvoted for visibility
Where can I see the list? This is such a quiet story I haven’t followed at all. I keep waiting for a bombshell headline story to drop
I mean, do you really think the public would buy that, even if they weren't involved? It'd look like a desperate attempt to convince everyone of their innocence, probably resulting in more people suspecting their guilt.
The news cycle is so quick the best thing to do if you're in trouble is just go silent until it all blows over. 

Somehow I don't think this one is going to blow over so easily. Don't forget who was on those flight logs and keep demanding answers.
So link to the flight log? Or does this twitter user have some weird access to it that we dont
That’s wasn’t a question
Could a reason for this be because of the dangers around this case, it is filled with powerful and immoral politicians and celebrities?
If they knew nothing, how would they be able to help ? Also why would they want to be associated with  a pedophile ? It’ll be best to not say anything at all especially since it’s so many people.
Actually, a couple have.
If the rich didn't use class consciousness to stay rich, their whole system would fall apart. they know they're all on the same team, and they have to be.
Do you think it's a conspiracy?
How do we know they aren't helping? For all we know the FBI got tons of cooperation from a majority of these people. Riding on a plane isn't a crime. Going to an island retreat isn't a crime. These people aren't going to be charged based on flight logs or pictures with Epstein. Why deny a crime you aren't accused of?
All I'm seeing is people saying 'I was there but I didn't see a thing'
Quite convenient really.
Yeah sure, if I was listed anywhere publicly, I wouldn't say shit either. Would only draw attention to me.
There *could* be many people working with authorities that we don't know about. I wouldn't be so dumb to come out publicly that I'm willing to help take down these people.
This is my Senator. He sold me, my fellow Coloradoans, and this nation to the telecom lobby for the price of $95,023 [r/Colorado]

Lol, they are actually laughing in our faces now. The whole of r/all is botted to hell and now a totally NOT conspiracy-related NN post gets 20k upvotes on here too. Sure.

EDIT: Since I made this post (5mins ago), the amount of upvotes went from 15.5k to 17.5k.

EDIT2: 5 minutes later again, now at 19.5k

EDIT3: 25K now, and it keeps rising.
I'm sorry, but what the fuck? The front page of /r/all has been spammed to help with "this is my senator" posts from numerous geographic subreddits that don't have the subscriber count to match their upvotes and were all posted at roughly the same time.


You want net neutrality? This is not natural discussion. You're pushing a political campaign and using unethical spam bot techniques to promote your content which undermines your cause of a free and fair internet.


Of course, reddit doesn't care about the intrinsic value of net neutrality. Reddit only cares that repealing net neutrality will cost them money.
Get this fake shit off of r/conspiracy 
Your senator is nothing but a piece of shit with big teeth. If I were you I would get on social media, write opinion pieces for local and state news papers and just try to inform every one you can about this douche bag who "represents" Coloradoans.

hurting your clearly biased efforts by being so political about it and shoving it down our faces over and over. fuck off 
The shilling is real today. This seems like a totally organic post.
Anyone who can tell me what this is doing in CONSPIRACY? No? Noone? Okay. *Organic*
This should be its own sub - a wall of shame of sorts. 
Front page today makes it blatantly obvious that Reddit.com is being manipulated by special interest groups. 
If you object to this so much, why do you support Trump, /u/orangutan ?
Heres a conspiracy, this whole thing is purely propaganda. Why are the top 383628 posts the same thing? These are not organic vote getting posts. Get this shit out of here
29k "organic" upvotes huh?
Not sure why this is in conspiracy.  Everyone knows it’s true...

Why be so blatant like this? They have to realize that people can see that something weird is going on. 
Fuck our system. We aren't even a democracy. We're a republic. I get that in the 1700's it was difficult to get shit voted on due to the technology at the time, but everyone has a fucking smart phone today. We need to purge these fucking sharks out of our country.
Such a strange state of affairs we are in. The same post popped up on my State’s sub. Pics of the ghost of the crooked congressmen of the present and how evil they are for not letting the government control the internet. The comments were oh so cleverly worded and mostly from 30-60 day old accounts. We are being led to believe that somehow the “conspiracy” is a congressmen’s vote is for sale? Or is it a “conspiracy” that democrats want more government oversight and republicans want the market to sort out messes? The market that is already fucking screwed over by... government oversight from purchased votes of the ghost crooked congressmen past. But boy, if we could just get everyone to understand that the democrat position on this issue is a “no brainer” and you are dumb and evil for opposing it, the ghost of crooked congressmen future will change evil ol’ Scrooge McTrump into a good guy. And then we all can swim in our equal piles of gold together!
It's that weasel that a lot of us Coloradoans tried so hard not to get elected. To think Mark Udall lost his seat to this scumbag is a travesty. A loss for Colorado, and America. We have let these scumbags fill our government and it's gonna be tough kicking them out. 
That's one of the biggest fake douchebag smiles I've ever seen. 
The image is absent now. And I can now comment on this because Reddit has removed archiving which was a clear attempt at censor.
I can’t view the picture any more 

“If you are looking for an image, it was probably deleted.”
Fuck off with this bullshit already. I'm sick of seeing it.
Y'all need to ask yourselves why soros,  Comcast,  and reddit FP are all clamoring in unison against the repeal of the buzzworded "net neutrality".  Its not what most people think it is.

fucking hell thats not enough money.

if they wanted to bribe me, they'd have to pay me the CEO bonus for the next decade; out of the CEOs pocket, personally. and I mean taking into considerations the amount of profits *after* the bill was passed. or maybe hand me majority shares.

pretty much I just wouldnt do it. even if they offered that I'd still tell them to fuck off and put whatever wealth and power I had against them. even if it literally cost me my career, home, and life and I could never win. I wouldnt care if i had to sell my home for pennies and beg on the street with dope fiends for the rest of my life.

in fact, im sure this will happen to me at some point. since i literally would not sell out for anything. ever. and im sure its going to ruin any career if i ever manage to get one.
Vote him out
Well he looks happy and cheerful after selling you for that price.

Politics in America are identical to pro wrestling.... in front of the camera and the public we all hate each other, “I’m gonna kick my opponents butt and im gonna wail him from here to high water” yet behind the scenes we’re all friends, going out to dinner, its all a work.... Its show biz... and thats what you have today in politics. The democrats and republicans aren’t opposed to each other.

We're almost there with the media too.
***VENTILATORS!!***
This makes me sad. One is entertainment and has never tried to be more than that. This shit actually matters. You celebrate such deception? You're then very much in denial of reality.
The s-mark
Left or right, national or local... Hell, even global. It's all a show. Bread and circus, baby. Bread and circus
Holyshit.
*waves hand over face dramatically* “Can’t see me!”
Pro wrestling is good tho
2020 became....in a very short time a year that's gonna go down in history
Was there really a time where people had serious debates about the whether or not wrestling was real?
Politics is like lemon meringue pie. It uhhh, it.... Alright politics is nothing like lemon meringue pie. It's more like horse shit
Were not almost there... were already there, just not everyone yet.
Not anymore there is a happy medium.
KUDOS!!!

Nobody ever claimed it was real. It is called Kayfabe and it is the practice of playing the character outside of the ring.
We are not almost there. We are 100% there.
People make fun of me for being a wrestling fan. And then I explain to them politics is just pro wrestling that people think is real.
Wrestling doesn't keep the roads paved or subsidize hospitals. It doesn't patrol the coasts or capture kidnappers. It doesn't maintain national parks or provide weather forecasts. It doesn't keep the collected archive of the national publication output or regulate the safety of the food supply.

These are the things that our political leaders (not just the figureheads) need to understand, manage and improve over time. They are serious work and we must not allow ourselves to accept bumbling idiots who barely know what the Constitution is, much less what the difference between Article I and II are to undermine our ability to keep those things working.

PS: If you thought I was talking about someone in particular, above, then you might be part of the problem.
And our ‘reality’ show president used to act in fake wrestling bouts too. 

But oh wait, I’m in r/conspiracy- I mean, ORANGE MAN GOOD
Wrestling isn't fake, its just predetermined outcomes and choreographed fights, but the hits are very real
Ohhh shit. Shots fired.
When I learned the NFL was fake, I didn't care
We need way more of this
This is actually Eric Weinstein’s idea. Highly recommend his podcast, The Portal, or his twitter account for those interested in heterodox thinking.
I've never understood why people's instant reaction to wrestling is "oh it's fake!!!". Like okay bud, every TV show and movie you enjoy is also fake, doesn't mean you can't enjoy the story it tells.
Remember when everyone here feared the media for their ability to sculpt narratives and control the masses, and now we embrace it?

It’s okay to question things, but when there is an overwhelming movement to proverbially remove the tongue of a leader we usually asked “why?”.
On the other hand, I quit watching wrestling when I was 7 because I didn't feel like being lied to anymore.

Almost?
Q: All media?
A: No, just the ones that say things I don’t like.

Post truth era
What do you mean...almost?
So true. So so sad and true.
Bernie and CNN fall underneath this as well
Almost hell
Make sure you check out the Firefly Funhouse Match.
only its not cheerable, if what you say is true...  wrestling isnt supposed to manage the country.
Amen.
Except for when bad republican is in power, when good democrat is in power then everything fine, darrr
If you post this in r/politics, guaranteed you will have a 17k deficit in karma.
There was a time when people unironically thought wrestling was real?

They had to announce it? WTF
Almost? I'd say it's been exceeded
Everyone thinks politic is fake until it's about something they want to hear, or someone suggests that their side is fake.
Finally admitted... From the beginning???

You don't know anything about pro wrestling, do you?
Kanye is trash.
69 upvotes I want to know?
Almost?
A bit ironic seeing this posted here given how hard conspiracy sucks republican dick.
This is so good
Until these cell towers all get dropped...
UFC added a perfect counter-entertainment for me.
The people enable it by treating politics like a sports.
Anyone deemed necessary at this point needs to be making double time pay!

We need to UNITE!

The CEO,CFO,Presidents and VPs of corporations have taken enough from us for long enough.

Seems stolen from the Joe rogan weinstein podcast or weinstein itself years ago.
The world is a work!
somebody has been listening to the portal
No we are there
YOU have to go out into the street and yell about it. MAKE a sign and walk around with it. Hospitals are getting their PPE confiscated by the fed and it is sold to three week old companies to then be resold to the highest bidder. All set up by Kushner for their cronies. Next step, no elections. You bitches going to stand by and let this happen?
As they say in india: sab mile hue hain ji.
I never bought it so I wasn’t*
lol!
I've heard 'the predator class' and I like that
People are happy just to for someone to cater to their ignorance. No matter what..
Some listen to the Eric Weinstein JRE this week.
Trump ordered feds to seize n95 maks shipments that were going to hospitals

This entire sub has turned into a fucking ridiculous bullshit joke
we are there now with corporate greed..  
but life goes on..
LOL, who is this a new idea to?
wrestlers would probably makes better decisions than politicians
Almost.,.we shouldve been there for last 100 years at least.
Remember when this guy listens to Joe Rogan and doesn’t acknowledge it.
Wrestling isnt wrestling my dude.
Kayfabe
Nice
We're almost there. Just one more incident and this entire political ponzi scheme will become obvious to the masses. The problem is, some people will never let go of their faith towards the government.
I was still on the front lines!!!!!!
Remember when they started hiring Actors for president in the 80s. Lawyers and actors make the best politicians, it’s not rocket science. Professional liars.
toto is always the hero(Debbs,Zinn,Ellsberg,Manning,Snowden,Swartz,etc)
People have been saying it for years. The media owns it's modern success to Vincent Kennedy Mcmahon. Politicians and the media play on your emotions, not logic. That's why we have all these obsessed over their candidates of choice and lose their shit when they see one they don't like. Just like when they obsessed over the Rock and would cry when Steve Austin would open a can of whoop-ass on him.
This insight is directly ripped from Weinstein on Rogans podcast
Can you smell what the politicians are cooking?
Eric Weinstein
I’ve always called politics “a soap opera for the masses”.  Something to entertain us, make us believe we’re a part of it all and to convince us things CAN change and we have a part in changing it.  

But no, it’s all bullsh*t.  Nothing more than a soap opera.  Enjoy the show! 🤬
Oh boy, r/enlightenedcentrism is going to make fun of us for being in the middle guys!!!!

We’re just idiots who can’t pick a side!!!
Wrestling isn't about control of TRILLIONS of dollars and thermo-nuclear weapons so....
Idiocracy comes full circle.
I have been saying for years.  Glad to similar thoughts. Take and upvote
When everyone didn't knew pro wrestling was fake? You are funny America
That’s been a running joke my American dad has been hearing in Cuba for 30+ years now.

‘Cuban news... American news, it’s all bullshit. The only difference is We (Cubans) know it. American’s don’t.’

It’s about time we wake up to the bs.
How did Op know he would be in the front page? That's the real conspiracy. Op is a time traveler.
Someone watches Joe Rogan
til; almost=completely
The pandemic, together with the daily WH briefings which is watched by many I hear, and the immediate reporting after said briefings should be enough for people to realize how blatantly manipulative the media is. 

Just report on what was said at the briefings, and let the VIEWER decide to make their own assumptions on that.

Example:

**Reporter:** asks about the HHS Inspector General report that found ongoing test shortages at a hospital. The issue was raised on March 23/24 and it was published on April 6. She at first didn’t know the name of the IG. 

**Admiral Brett Giroir:** answers that he is on the phone all day with hospitals, who has shortages, who needs equipment, other issues they need help with, etc. Ends it with “if that IG had these issues on March 23/24, why am I finding out about it at 8am this morning from the press (this was April 6). 

**Anderson Cooper:** reporter who asked a fair question was attacked and belittled by admiral Brett Giroir. Giroir didn’t even know about the IG report that detailed hospital supply issues, even though it has been reported that this whole country is dealing with hospital supply shortages for weeks now!
This is called hypernormalisation
Vote libertarian.
I would say we are there. Anyone with a shred of sense saw CNN put Trump in office in 2016. It was obvious, and documented, that he got 600% more air time during the election. And yet people choose to blame Russia for the heinous fact that we had no acceptable choices. Pleasant fiction to assuage those plagued by the obvious fact that our "democracy" is pure theater, and will continue to be nothing more until we burn it down.
People don’t care, they will still treat politics like it’s a sports team
Almost there? We're fully there and have been for the past year.
We are there.
Kayfabe.
Thats.... way too accurate. Who's with me on ditching the country
Most people already do. Smh
a smark, a smart mark. someone who knows they are being conned. We are there... Donald Trump is a natural at wrestling psychology.
It's like (((they))) don't even care anymore.
Too bad everybody here doesn’t realize that trump and his GOP friends are the government lol
Just gotta get the UFC and NFL to admit they have been rigged the whole time and its the unholy trinity (obviously controlled by Israel)
Holy fuck. Can reddit stop crying about the president on EVERY sub? I want to see conspiracies, not this.
Rut yet
It’s true American politics are a joke, but they’re not “fake”. Politicians have actions that have real consequences.
It’s real to me gosh dammit!
This is like something a 14 year old would post after watching a couple of Illuminati conspiracy videos on YouTube.
SS: oops *the.     
[NP link](https://np.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/fwti76/almost_there/).  Such a great tweet.  How long until it gets removed??
Yeah, we watch Trump's briefing every afternoon. It's a "*tremendous*" source of comedy in our house. "*We've never seen anything like it*". We especially find funny his disjointed hyperbolic ramblings and one can tell everyone up there has to "kiss the ring". Then he looms next to the podium as if he needs to be within reach of the people he sends up there in case they go off script or start to correct his umm ... "misstatements".  

Pro wrestling's got nothing on Trump's inept and hilariously transparent, "Perception Management Theater."

When we want to know what's really happening we watch Governor Hogan's press meetings.
Sorry, but who are *they* and why are they the governing force on whether wrestling is fake or not?

*It's still real to me, damn it!*
Off topic, if yall have Crave.. the dark side of the ring season 2 episode 2 about extreme wrestler new jack.  Guy was fucked check it out.  Thats some real shit
That is some 1984 shi right there!
that's showbiz baby
yeah, everyone else is nuts. not me though haha, not my media. trump is bad guys lol
Lies! Pelosi clapping back at Trump proves she means business you goddamn millennials. /s
Pro wrestling is what it is because you can't have 2 giant men go at each other without doing permanent damage to one another. These guys want a career, not injuries. So pro wrestling gives the emotional highs of a fight via drama without as much broken bones.

Politics is not like that. Oh sure, the antagonism of single issue politics helps stir the pot and keep us distracted. But the fight between left and right is hand-waving distraction because it is and always was between up and down. And the GOP is willing to destroy the political machine because they're ready to move to fascism.
Well if your a Trump supporter, your already there
I mean in terms of the Democrat party we are there.

One of the benefits of Trump through was to show that the Republican primary process apparently still counts for something, even if it happened kicking and screaming.

I mean regardless of where you stand you can't tell me that it took some rather large testicles on the right wing of America to let that happen in order to protect the integrity of the system. And I'll say it. Good on them for letting it happen.

Meanwhile we have the DNC arguing in court that donors can't get their money back because they should have known the Democratic primaries were rigged.
