Matt Lowne's videos all Copyright claimed, even though the music "Dream" is one of Youtube studio's copyright free music.

Would he get in trouble if he deleted all the videos and re-uploaded them?
Shouldn’t it get slapped down then since they dont have the copyright
From a 4-week old post on the "Dreams" [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO8escJC78):

>"Hey ChilledCow can you approve this comment? This song is getting people's videos claimed. It takes portions of another song that is not free to monetise and revenue sharing will be imposed on any video that contains this song. Ads will also be placed on the video by the owner of the original track."

So it seems like ChilledCow/Joakim Karud may not have had the proper rights to use whatever Sony song they sampled from... this is really sad and I'm sorry to hear that it is affecting Matt.... I hope this gets turned around quickly!
youtube needs to fix their shit.  it is absolutely unreal that some rando can pose as a  multi billion dollar company, copyright claim  a ton of videos with youtubes own copyright free music in it, and get away scot free.  the youtuber is punished, but the claimer suffers 0 repercussions  for false claims.
I don't play KSP a ton anymore, but I watch Matt's videos every week. This really is crazy and I hope it works out in his favor.
YouTube has been progressively being less and less creator-friendly since the last few years, in favor of large corporations who exploit and abuse the copyright takedown / claim tool against starting, small-time, and enterprising creators.

Hey, remember when [Fox straight-up used a gameplay clip from a 2009 YouTube video for their 2016 Family Guy episode, then *proceeded DMCA the shit out of the original 2009 video?*](https://torrentfreak.com/fox-stole-a-game-clip-used-it-in-family-guy-dmcad-the-original-160520/)
Mumbo Jumbo. This is just like Mumbo Jumbo. Damn it.
Looks like a mumbo jumbo repeat the YouTube system is so unfair!

First the bullshittery with Astartes and now Matt? YouTube is just ridiculous.
On a lonely video-sharing service slowly spinning its way to damnation...
With as easy as it is for big companies to shut down content creators, I vote we change YouTube's name to TheirTube.

It was fun while it lasted, but I think we need a new platform that actually gives a crap about the people that actually make their product.
Best KSP Youtuber.
Couldnt people just copyright claim all of Sony/UMG videos as the ultimate "no u" or is that illegal.

Also it's funny considering how what UMG is doing is technically illegal since the music falls under fair use
We need to give this all the attention we can and spread this around. Matt doesn’t have nearly as many subs as Mumbo Jumbo (who had a similar copyright issue back in May), and there’s a real threat of his channel being terminated...all for *one* song that’s supposed to be okay to use and isn’t even in all of his claimed videos.

Fuck Sony
Sony/ATV is one of - if not *the* - biggest music publishers in the world. If we do the autism thing like what happened to Shia Leboeuf (sp?) then we might get their attention. Start by mega-spamming each American office with letters and KSP references. https://www.sonyatv.com/en/contact
They *will* bow to the power of the mighty **Space Kraken**!
OK, where do we turn up with the pitchforks and burning torches to get this sorted out. Reddit doesn't take this kind of thing laying down!
With rewind around the corner, we need to break out our alternate accounts to dislike it more.
YouTubers who have this happen to them should be able to sue for damages in small claims court or something.  But, as usual, the big players control the system and are above the rules while the peons have to play by the rules and take it in the ass.

I'd watch Matt whatever platform he's on - his videos are a great watch in the evening
Man, YouTube's really been crazy lately. First Markiplier's subscribers getting banned for literally doing what he asked them to do, and now this? Sad times.
[deleted]
How can we actualy help? I love his videos...
After a claim the profits from the claimed videos should be frozen instead of split between the companies claiming the videos until the claim is proven to be false or not
This has been going for too long, I call for public beheading of Susan
We seriously need an alternative to GreedTube
This is why I'm moving to pornhub
go out and get this upvoted all the way to r/all
Move to a new video platform such as LBRY. Vote with your feet and let freedom ring.
It's going to get to the point where people make sure their video has no music in it at all...then they are going to get a copyright claim against "the sound of silence".
Imma bout to rage
Moral of the story is burn large corporations to the fucking ground yeah?
Man this happened to Mumbo Jumbo with Warner-Chappell, though at least they had some grounds for it, since he used a remix of one of their songs
I'm so done with youtube. They can go fuck themselves. Matt is one of my favorite youtubers.
This is crap. Youtube is just letting creators be bullied.
That sucks. I saw he had an update that I put off watching, but it seems I'll have to put it off for eternity.

I'm not sure on the specifics, so feel free to correct any 'crazy grandpa' aspects of how this works. 

I honestly think the law should exempt platforms from copyright violations by monetized contributors since they aren't commissioning or encouraging that behavior. Those people have provided info to the hosting site and by definition are not anonymous. They should just be able to say "Nope, no violation here", get their video back, and the company can escalate to DCMA against the channel.
Time to lawyer up and sue the copyright trolls.
They did the same thing to me.  Claimed about 30 videos that featured a song I'd gotten from their own fuckin music service.  I ended up just deleting the videos.  Stupid bullshit.
YouTube has really taken the “you” out of it
Could you sue the other party for something like this? It would be pretty easy to prove innocence and show monetary damages as well. And nobody flags every single one of a youtubers videos on accident.
Sony being cunts. What a surprise.
Sincerely, it's quite frustrating. He worked so hard in every video, so much effort, so much dedication and love, and then a frikin' company comes, automatically copyrights years of content, being fair or not, with no consequences whatsoever, and then, if he doesn't win 3 of the appeals in dozens of videos, he gets his channel deleted. What is this crap?
Sony doesn't care . susantube doesn't care. fuck you, give us your money.
Jeb, time to Lithobreak on SonyATV
YouTube should just be called “Tube” because it’s no longer about the users.
So, at this point it looks like they’re taking a page from eBay’s playbook to chase off small—in this case, content creators—users to reestablish the platform as an professional content delivery system. 

In eBay’s case they didn’t want to play host to grandma trying to sell a trinkets she makes for extra cash any more. They want to compete with Amazon and play host to large resellers that bring volume. So, they changed the rules to make smaller users not want to play. 

In YouTube’s case here it sure seems like they’re intentionally running off small creators so they can compete with the likes of Netflix.
Can someone make a business account and claim all the videos of corporations on youtube, then just refuse their appeal and take their money. The fuck is youtube gonna do? THey aint doing shit.
isn't this just grounds for a lawsuit? their reckless disregard has damaged his livelihood.
That's just heartbreaking.
Even worse that if you try to fight the claim, those who did the claim pretty much just get an e-mail that says "Are you sure this is your content? Check yes or no". No fucking chance the claimant is gonna say no.
Sony got one of my Instagram posts deleted because there was a song on the radio. It was barely audible enough in the background of a conversation
Sounds to me like the Board of Sony/ATV needs to take a one way trip to the Mun...
You know, it would be nice, in this rotten world, at least for Take Two to take the side of one of the main "small guys" giving their product free promotion, and sue the heck out of whoever filed all those fake copyright claims.

But that's never going to happen, is it?

Maybe he could join the Youtuber's union. Although their first wave of "shitstorm protest" is somewhat ineffective. What has far bigger potential are the lawsuits they are preparing for.
Time to boycott Sony and YouTube.
But Matt Lowne is one of the most family friendly creators out there. He teaches rocket science to the people!
damn,  Matt lowne was great too :(
I don't suppose he kept the original video/soundtracks without the music?  Could he re-upload them without the music?
What would happen if we all filed DCMA cliams against any video owned by youtube/google
This exact same thing happened to MumboJumbo a while back. He got all his videos claimed by Warner Chappell (who was listed in the emails Matt read in his video)
It time for a fucking crusade
this is actually quite sad tbf, shows how large companies and corporations have the upper hand, and will continue to have the upper hand forever.
Just fucking sue. Just fucking sue Sony.

This is 100% top 10 saddest anime moments of all time
I've had enough of youtube.
What the flip is this?
Shouldn't YouTube get an alarm when basically an entire channel's content get copyright claims on all video's from couple of months that only use  music that YouTube provides for creators?
Anyone still up for the YouTube HQ raid?
Fuck you Sony and Warner’s
YouTube is dead, move to bitchute
Youtube will turn into a platform solely for children's entertainment and clips of latenight shows. You watch
Sony's litigation team are scum. And I say that as someone who regularly defends the legal profession.

They don't sue because they're right, or because they have something to protect. They sue to scare and intimidate in order to maximise profit.

Frivilous and vexatious lawsuits are their daily driver.
I swear youtube operates like a government in some dystopian book...
Question

What stops us from all claiming EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE with these notices (I say start with all or any larger companies and channels first)

Will that fuck the system enough to change it?
YouTube copyright claim system back at it again, being absolutely trash and runing content creators lives
My latest strikes came from covering 100-300 year old folk tunes.  

Cause, you know, those drunk Irish dudes in 1723 we’re all about their song copyrights.
Someone please actually invent middle-out compression so that we can create a new YouTube.
If YT wanted to solve this issue it would be fairly simple.

Implement the 3 strike system in reverse. File 3 (or whatever) false copyright claims in a fixed period of time and you loose the ability to file copyright claims.

It is not in their interest to do this though, so they will not.

I feel for Matt, I enjoy his videos.
Time to move to bitchute.
Should start a boycott of all Sony products.
I’ve been seeing a lot of this stuff over time and lately, I’m just wondering, is there any large scale lawsuit or something someone could file against YouTube for doing this shit? This kinda shit is so broken and assuming it happens to a YouTuber who’s primary income comes from YouTube, that could literally ruin their life, so there’s gotta be something there right? These “claims” companies have been putting on videos are often nonsensical, and there’s usually no way to deny it, and the appeal process is garbage, and it hasn’t been fixed for years? When is someone gonna do something about this? It’s heartbreaking. Surely I’m not the only one who wants some kind of uprising over YouTube by now
Nationalize YouTube, remove ability for companies to copyright strike will nilly. YouTube has shown it is incapable of managing a site with the importance of YouTube.
Fuck Youtube. Nobody should be using their platform anymore. This kind of stuff happens everyday and now that it happened to you, you either have a big enough revenue train for YouTube to care, or they don't. Its that simple. YouTube does not care about its content creators.
This is why we need the [YouTubers Union](https://youtubersunion.org/).
first I see pixar content here...

then I see this...

now I am seriously worried about our space simulator friends...
Just copyright claim your own videos.

Idiots.
F
Is there a way to support Matt and maybe petition to get his videos back? 

There's no way I would ever subscribe to YouTube,  but this kind of stuff makes me want to delete it off my phone.
Does that whole "deadlock" thing still work? where a creator puts a bunch of various tracks in the video, so that instead of getting claimed by one company and all advert money going to them, it gets claimed by like 5 different ones and the money doesnt go to anyone?
Christ. Just found this guy, too. :(
It's bad way the YouTube copyright claims system operates .and the big companies take the advantage of it....after such claims the only option is edit the video to replace the song in yt studio
Mumbo, then Matt... Why can’t they strike early when there are only 2 videos instead of when there are hundreds or even thousands
A group of us YT loving redditors should start a company. A company that claims the videos of companies that wrongfully claim videos.
Youtube's entire system is fucked first Mumbo Jumbo, now Matt. Why does Youtube never learn?
Fucking corporate terrorists
Right then, does Elon musk have enough to by YouTube
Wtf
Not a fan, but damn that's bullshit
Didn't Matt's channel previously have the "channel video" with the "Hooked on a feeling" /  Guardians of the Galaxy trailer intro on it?

I don't know about the rest of the music, but that one certainly came to mind.
Youtube sucks.  


Dreaming of the good ol ad-free days
Why don't youtubers just sue youtube for damages and loss of earnings? The claim that they 're erroneously destroying people's livelihood.
Could we create a bot that automatically copyright claim every video of sonyATV ?
**Reloads LMG with Religious Intent**
Serious question: What's to stop all of us from fighting back and copyright striking the videos of people/companies that do this?
So here is the whole situation summed up: 

* A claim was made with no legal basis, completely BS claim that would never hold up in any court

BUT

Assuming that the channel isn't some super rich/popular dude, any court battle would be so extremely costly that it is almost always forces the channel to just take the claims.
YouTube has some serious issues.
[deleted]
This is absolute garbage.
What the fuck man. His videos are literally some of the best I've ever seen on youtube.
That's it, let's storm YouTube hq.
Hopefully what happens is that this bullshit is fixed, everyone hears about it, and Matt's channel grows even larger because of this nonsense.
Sad to see this guy leave he is the one that introduced to me KSP and in general PC gaming :(
Crap
The claims are false though so they will probably take them down hopfuly
It is now Kerbal SBASS Program.
Here's the bill: *shows 100 meter long receipt*
It is now Kerbal SBASS Program.
He put out a video about it too.
Same thing happened to mumbo jumbo. This freaking sucks
That is a shot in the gut. So many great videos. I hope this doesn’t completely demoralise him.

Keep making content Matt.

I'm seeing a _lot_ of terrifyingly Rand-esque viewpoints on Net Neutrality.

When your porn access is being restricted because your ISP is run by a porn-hating mormon (for an example) you'll have literally no recourse but to move to a different part of the country, or whinge incessantly about it. The average person doesn't have the option of moving house just because things are inconvenient for them.

_Now_ is the time to stop this, while we're at Apoapsis and our small actions can have the greatest effect.. to use a Space analogy.
When we get down into Periapsis and start aerobraking into a network-nanny society..we won't have the political delta-v to get out of it again.

Does anyone remember the internet before 2015 when there was no net neutrality? Nothing happened without it. Does anyone remember when AOL charged by the hour to access the internet? There was no government action to stop that. Does anyone really want to keep net neutrality so trump has more power over your internet? I mean, trump is literally worse than hitler, right?

From a press release:

"The Australian Space Agency celebrated the launch of it's spaceship, the R.A.N. Space Cunt today. What a proud day for 'Straya!"
I was kind of hoping it would catch up to a first stage and boosters somehow and reattach
I am now glum, because it took me SO DAMN LONG to get the joke.
this is goddamn hilarious
The perspective really put it into perspective

Wow why don't we launch crafts from there. Saves money and fuel
Am Australian. Can confirm. Landing and reentry will use a lot of fuel but orbiting shouldn't be that hard
I come from a land down under!

That doesn't seem fair... I have to shoot my rockets up but they just have to drop them.

But don’t you need a rocket engine to land again?
I'm in class right now. I had to restrain myself so much.
Thanks man, this brightened up my morning.
I predict you gold!
How hard could it be? They just gotta put guys in ships then let go as they fall off of the earth. 
It must be so much easier for you guys.
Funny
Ahah ahah I get it
Idea: what if gravity worked like this. The direction of gravity always pointed the same way but the *strength* of gravity decreased with added distance to the planet. You would still be able to go into a stable orbit but it would be a lot different from what we're used to right?

Fun fact: Squad is/was an advertising company. KSP was kind of a fortunate accident.
Weird. I don't use the installer but the zip download from the KSP Shop directly. I have network monitoring running at home and never saw any connections from KSP to any weird servers. Update checks from Mods yes, but nothing else. 

Is it steam specific oder at least binary installer specific?
Just click accept without reading it. 
Just to make this clear: they always did this. It is just due to the new data protection rules in the EU that they must explicitly state what data they collect and to what purpose and where and what third parties might get a hold of that data.

Though it honestly seems like they are just using a pre-worded statement. While things like collecting gameplay information, user created content, leaderboards and sharing with hardware manufacturers are quite common in the industry and not really too problematic, mentioning names, phone numbers and **photos** is certainly not industry standard. I highly doubt they actually collect these infos. It sounds more like an agreement for a mobile app, which **do** often happen to collect that aggressively.

Note that the new EU rules coming into effect at the end of May also require them to list a data protection officer whom you can contact to ask question about their data collection, have them send over your data or ask to have it deleted. Might be worth asking them to send over a dataset to see if they *actually* collect personal information.
This agreement is illegal in Europe as it contradicts the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which was enacted on 25May 2018.


Has anyone compared the old EULA and new EULA?

I'd be interested in testing what my rights are with regards to the fact that the EULA has changed since I bought the product.
Yeah, like the rest are saying, this seems pretty standard for a EULA, chances are t2 use the same one for all their games to save on legal costs. I wouldn't expect KSP to actually harvest all or any of the data mentioned in the screenie simply because it's a single player game with no account making, and in terms of advertising, the community is small enough that intensive data harvesting wouldn't be worth the benefits. I don't actually know this for certain, but it's what makes the most sense to me. Hope that helps! :-)
What information would KSP have about me that isn't already publicly available? 
Steam is a 3rd party program to KSP and requires network functionality to register things like Achievements, Steam Cloud, etc..

This EULA is basically saying "Hey guys, we are on Steam, and therefore are sharing the data with Steam that you already know about since you read the Steam EULA (right?)"  It's harmless and redundant when parented under the Steam EULA - and here's why.

In the new'ish world of consumer aware privacy problems - there is a crackdown coming where more and more companies are going to be forced by their legal advisers to ensure they are communicating EXACTLY what their product is sharing (across all platforms) so there is no ambiguity to the users about what the game or product might be sharing.  Regardless of what other parent EULAs a user & developer might be bound to on the specific distribution platform (EG: Steam, Xbox live, iOS App store, etc..)  SO, many companies will get a new EULA drafted to cover all their bases on all platforms and plop that EULA out there to CYA.

Terrible example: Steam collects all of that information in the "information we collect" section of that EULA for things like billing, payments, etc.  Thus, by extension KSP (and all other Steam games) are technically doing so as well (even though they don't have direct access to much of that data, they have access to it via proxy - EG: instead of KSP knowing your REAL name, they know your SteamID.)  Since there can be confusion among less technically savvy users about things like "Why did KSP tell my Boss that I was playing KSP during my sick day?!" - we all know it really wasn't KSP, it was Steam doing what Steam does - and the user might not have known that their profile was set to public.  If this user decides to make a stink about it, goes viral with some kind of uninformed post about "KSP GOT ME FIRED!!1!!" it creates the potential for a legal complication for the KSP team when in reality the user just didn't understand how the system works and should instead blame themselves for not reading the Steam EULA and making their profile private.

Again, all of that "information we collect" is mirrored in the Steam EULA - although it's not spelled out in such pedantic and unnecessary legalese to make people freak out at the language like this review.  Calling KSP Spyware is simply wrong.

Most developers that build games for Steam just let the Steam EULA cover these requirements like an umbrella over their product.  That's kind of the point of a Meta EULA for things like this.  That said, larger companies with more exposure and larger legal teams often want their own EULA to CYA.  Legally unnecessary and redundant in most cases, but - like I said.  Much legal CYA is in full effect in the "post Cambridge Analytica Facebook data leak" and GDPR world.
[deleted]
Name, email, phone, mailing address, payment information? KSP doesn't know any of that. This section is intended to apply to some of Take Two other games where you do indeed register, make payments, and thus provide some of that information.
Now.

Aren't most of these things, well you know, generic?

KSP is played on computers and PS4.
Geolocation, would be tied to your home, phone numbers is a stretch but could get them off of phone programs on your computer.

E-mail addresses is also a stretch, as this would require KSP to actively be browsing your cookies and stored temp data. 

This honestly sounds more like a mobile EULA than for a grounded system.

I would say that this is a generic document, and that KSP doesn't actually collect this stuff.


It's like you all don't understand what analytics are... Every game made with Unity collects this info if they have the analytics platform enabled.. 
I dunno. Why arent you talking about the phone in your pocket, or that copy of windows youre running, or that facebook account you have?

Let me put this as plainly as I can for the slow ones in class...

**YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SOLD AT THE DROP OF A HAT. PERIOD. END OF STORY.**

Welcome to the **information** age.
AhHah! Time To Use The USSR And Nazi Flags And Start Drilling For Oil On The Mun!!
Before you grab your pitchforks(again), please read the original EULA before take two took over and understand that they're basically the same thing.

Then grab your pitchforks and find the politicians, lawyers, and stupid end users that make this kind of shit our reality.

GDPR their ass if you live in the EU. Consent has to be explicit and affirmative ("by using this software you consent" is not affirmative).
The real question is, is KSP even capable of recording this information, or is it a cookie cutter EULA that just wants to cover all the bases?
Because EULAs mean effectively nothing anymore...
No problem. Ill ignore my purchased version and go back to playing my pirated version.
This belongs in the category of "We can't have cool things". The moment you think you make a fair EULA you get sued for something mundane you thought was common sense. 

If you sell your game online for example you get a bunch of data about your customer like the credit card number, country aka. "geolocation", name, adress, age and what not. It's absolutely normal but you still need the agreement to collect it otherwise someone could sue you for saving this customer data without permission. 

In Germany for example a company is required to keep some customer data for at least 10 years so that the authorities can issue a tax audit at any given time. The authorities need to know where the money a company makes is coming from otherwise it could be money laundry or something.

This is very basic stuff without which the internet wouldn't work. I don't know what exactly it is that causes such outrage. This is not even comparable to Facebook which tracks you as a non-user around the internet using spy like/share buttons they managed to place on so many websites. These buttons look innocent but they load a script from the facebook servers which is also needed to check how much likes something got already and so on. 

Here such an innocent small script that comes with the button I'm sure everybody understands: [script.js](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y5/r/iloWW7-SRrR.js) Amonst all this code is a function that is used named

> startRecording()

You can press Ctrl+F to search for startRecording() if you want to check it that's true. I'm not an expert on this and it could really be totally innocent but a function named startRecording() on a share button script is still somewhat suspicious. Anyways, I just wanted to clarify that the recent Facebook outrage has a completely different dimension because people compared it to KSP's EULA. 

It has been discussed. I personally don't care but many are up in arms!
Can I just have my game and play it privately without connecting to Steam? I mean, Steam doesn't own what I bought right? Right guys?! RIGHT!?
Because it's standard ass-covering boilerplate that's in every TOS ever if you're so much as collecting a byte of gameplay data.

Same as the giving facebook/imgur/reddit rights to your photos/text, so they can legally host them on their servers, serve them to other users and move them around their CDNs.
We talked about it when it happened.  Extensively.
Honestly these are pretty industry standard. 

I'm not saying it's right.
Make a firewall rule to disallow it from connecting to the internet...
This is likely just to make things very clear due to gdpr enforcement starting in May and does not mean KSP has changed any data usage or policy
Some fun excerpts from the old EULA. (https://web.archive.org/web/20130117165014/http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/licenseagreement.php)

  
> The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. **The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold**.  

Guess you do not own the game, how weird.

> (c) Prohibition on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly.
**You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT**, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. 

Well, this should make any mods more complicated than adding a part illegal. Guess you cannot use FAR/kOS/... anymore.

> 3. TERMINATION 
Without prejudice to any other rights, Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA. In such event, **you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in your possession.**

I am not sure how you destroy software copies, but you have to.

My favourite part at the end:
> 7. MODIFICATIONS.
Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. has the right to modify this EULA and impose and modify new or additional terms and conditions regarding the use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT at any time, making available on this site all the new or modified terms and/or conditions. All new and/or modified terms and/or conditions will be effective 10 (ten) days after their publishing and will be part of this EULA. Within the 5 (five) days following the publishing of the modifications and/or additions, the user must inform Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. via e-mail, regarding your non acceptance of the modifications or additions. Once said term has elapsed, your continued use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be deemed as the express acceptance of said new or modified terms or conditions. **Thus, once the term mentioned above has elapsed, if you do not accept the new terms and conditions you must immediately stop using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.**

Well, if you don't accept the new EULA, you cannot keep playing the old versions, there goes your loophole.

Guess the old EULA was not as permissive as people have thought.
Valve does the same.  No one cares
The EULA says the game is legally allowed to collect this info. Spyware means the game actually does collect it. Inferring the latter from the former doesn’t make much sense. I’m completely against stupid and overly broad EULAs, but let’s make sure we understand the problem.
Someone should check if the game actually sends data to their servers or if it's just through the actual purchase of the game that they do this. If it's point of sale, pirate the shit out of it. If it's not, pirate the shit out of it and play in an internet disabled VM.
First: "Well so what they want to be able to have leaderboards and some promotional material"

\*reads next paragraph\*

"Excuse me?"
Probably just a clause their lawyers put in.

I couldn't find anything sketchy in game/launcher code (un-obfuscated C# source code since it's a Unity game). Used Fiddler to intercept/decrypt http/https traffic, only data I saw them send on startup, gameplay, and game exit is game id, OS, resolution, whether or not you have DLC installation, whether or not your game is modded, and what language pack you use.

Sketchiest thing I saw was that Discord was sending what games I was playing to their servers even though I don't have game activity enabled. :/
This part in the EULA is used when there is any account making or in in-game stores. The collecting personal information is required when they have to save account info in a database that they own. And saving payment info would equate to steam asking if you would like to save your payment info for a faster purchase next time.

Since T2 uses the same EULA across games. I guess they just payed no mind to it.
This is because of the new EU data protection law (GDPR) which requires companies to obtain explicit consent for collection and use of every bit of information. The EULA looks like copy-pasted boilerplate to cover every possible scenario - note that just because an EULA says a company may collect and use a piece of information, doesn't mean it does. Instead, this is a bit of arse-covering. I doubt KSP has suddenly added a bunch of data collection. On the other hand, KSP (and Steam and Steam games in general) collect more data on users than most people probably realise (e.g. to see what locations people are playing, on what hardware, etc).

Also: if anyone is going to make spyware, they won't go and tell you about it in their user agreement! That would kinda be like a burglar sending you a formal letter to inform you about their intention to rob your house!


Oh no, how dare they take my information! I’m going to post a status about this on Facebook! 


Seriously, who the fuck cares.
Stop overreacting and read any EULA for any other game.  I guarantee they are almost completely identical.  Hell, if you want to scare yourself shitless, read the EULA for iTunes or Facebook.
I mean, pretty standard ToS
because it doesn't affect you in any way
Guess what, KSP was never Spyware in the first Place.
Sounds like someone simply offered them a price for your personal data
Because we did that when it was new:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/search?q=eula&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all

In fact, we did that [ad nauseam](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/82vyax/how_can_i_filter_eula_posts_im_so_tired_of_seeing/).
It looks like boilerplate. 

They probably don't actually collect anything, but in case they accidentally do they need to be covered.

Now obviously there's no guarantee they don't, they have permission, but it's effectively impossible for them to collect most of this information. The OS simply doesn't have most of it. 
Because this sort of EULA is nothing new. It's just people are getting in a big hoohah about it now because of the Facebook stuff.
I would expect a lot of similar changes to EULAs, since GDPR is coming into effect soon. 

A lot of companies who didn't worry too much about data protection before are now correctly nervous that GDPR might cause issues for them if they do not become fully transparent on what they do with what data and get consent on everything.

They are just covering their asses for when GDPR comes into effect.
who gives a shit? for anyone who is worried about this just remember your facbook, twitter, instagram, google, phone (including the mic), tablet, steam account, etc all gather and record any personal information about you, record what you are doing, where you are, where you work, what car you drive, the conversations you have with others, all of it. they sell all of this to any company willing to pay. mad? dont be because you clicked "i agree". we dont live in such a private world anymore.
From what I read here is Europe safe from this, but is it the European union or the entirety of Europe?
People are saying this is a standard and acting like that should make it ok when if this is a industry standard for games that literally have no reason for something like this then that should raise more questions. Of course you can always rely on T2 to come with the bullshit.
Good thing I saved a copy before 2two takeover.
Can I get a TL:DR?
when push comes to shove they literally cannot use the agreement in court.
They better get in line. Facebook, google, windows, antivirus, and steam already called dibs.
Because its completely voluntary and you have no one else to blame but yourself if you have your data collected?
I understand this type of EULA from a multiplayer game or even an MMO, but from a single player game where you don’t ever interact with others? This is too much. And there is no basis for these EULA stipulations for a single player, completely offline experience, other than for the purposes of collecting your data to sell it.
This is standard; who cares?
This is part and parcel for an EULA. What's your issue?
Not only is this a standard run of the mill EULA, it is almost exactly the same as the original Squad EULA.  Can we please stop bringing this up like it is the end of the world?
[deleted]
Is this retroactive?
> governmental authorities

I've always said KSP is simply crowd-sourcing information for NASA disguised as a video game.
If we purchased KSP before it was acquired by Take Two Interactive, did we ever receive a notification that the EULA had changed? 
that dooooesn't look GDPR compliant to me...
I always blamed rockstar for the wrong things in GTA V Online, now I really think that it is because of t2, they arent really receiving the hate they deserve. 
Have they given any "reason" why?
I have KSP without Steam. Does this still apply to me?
Wait, can they spy on my computer or how many kerbals I kill?
Damn this really sucks 
Almost all software are Hoarding (big) data. 💰 For an example Windows. 
They would be stupid if they won't do it.
I dont say its right what they do. I only say it pretty normal to do.
Ehh my data is as worthless as me so I don't care
It’s literally a copy-paste if their standard EULA. As far as I’ve seen, by monitoring network activity for the app on my rig, it’s nothing major, no spying as far as I can tell.
The way to really change these types of EULAs and behavior is to stop using everything. Stop using your computer, stop using your phone, stop using the internet, stop playing games, stop buying games. 

That's the only way it's going to end. Go outside, take a hike, go camping whatever. Just stop doing the same things over and over and expect that any company or government is going to stop doing this or even having these sorts of EULAs. Note; government doesn't have EULAs, they just do it. 
This makes me glad that I never converted my game to Steam and I am still playing an older version. 
well peeps time to love to decentralized apps. You are paid for your attention and you sell your own data. 
Because everyone did talk about it and it is nothing. There’s nothing worrisome in the EULA and Squad has addressed it multiple times and the world isn’t ending.
I'm going to assume this is a response to the new laws that are being inserted in the US that grants the government complete access to everything you post or store online. This time it's not to stop terrorism, or capture pedophiles, but to \[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Online\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop\_Enabling\_Sex\_Traffickers\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act)\). The effect is essentially that every company that has any type of online forum become responsible for what people post, store and share.

As discussed elsewhere on Reddit, this may mean that the US government might claim that you are involved with sex trafficking if you for example happen to have naked pictures of your wife on your Google Drive. And it becomes Googles responsibility to report any pictures like this to the government, because they can't possibly know that it's your wife. That's why Microsoft changed their EULA a few weeks back stating that any naked pictures / pornography will be automatically deleted from OneDrive.

They knew people wouldn't buy "because of Al'Qaida" anymore, so they went with something else and something that you obviously will not be able to fight with this method. The US government wants to see what everyone is doing, so that they know who are critical against the US government. This is fascism. There's just no way around it.
I guess I won't be installing any new updates for ksp, huh?
I mean, is this not a pretty standard one? "We're going to collect some information about you for marketing purposes." is what I see there. Doesn't look like they're collecting anything that a dozen other things aren't collecting as well.
I'm pretty sure that this violates the upcoming GDPR legislation.  
* First of all, you need to gain consent to collect data with a "Positive Opt-in". I don't think the EULA counts as a positive opt-in. You need this for each and every piece of information collected. Explicit consent requires a very clear and specific statement of consent. (Be specific and ‘granular’ so that you get separate consent for separate things. Vague or blanket consent is not enough. ICO Website)  
* **Keep your consent requests separate from other terms and conditions.** (ICO website)  
* BUT MOSTLY. **Avoid making consent to processing a precondition of a service.**  
Boy, if these guys share my data I'm gonna let Elizabeth take them on.

This needs all the upvotes.
You are now among my favorite people
Can’t wait for KSP2 in spring 2020
This my be my new favorite post. Seriously perfect. I can picture Ted Stryker and Otto Pilot flying that at this very moment
Amazing
Holy shit 

It’s finally here
Thank you for this, every time I remember this I get nostalgia and think about that egg regurgitation scene.. one of my favourite movies ever
Yup.

You win.

That's it. Meme's over y'all. This guy won. Let's go home.
This is the first version of this $#!t that has been even remotely funny or clever.
This is why Kerbals exist.
Because Fuck aerodynamics.
Epic.  Now we just need an inflatable Kerbal autopilot
Now do the airplane mode cover
I like how people are doing this and I cant even get a normal plane to fly.
One of my favorite movies, and favorite games? Well played!!
I was waiting and hoping for someone to do this. Thank you.
How is the Aerospike video coming along?
Activate the autopilot!
How can this even fly? KSP's weird drag calculations?
Excuse me. I happened to be passing, and I thought you'd might like some coffee!
Now can you make the dabbing plane from airplane mode?
Airpain
Low man pool
hahahahahahahahaha.. epic..
What program is this?
I applaud you
Let’s just hope that airplane mode isn’t made
This is the best one yet!
Looks like you were Flying High.

Does it fly?
Surely you can't be serious?

It’s knot a plane 😂
I can dig grease 'n chompin' on some buns and draggin' through the garden.
You should call it the pretzel plane

Love this! I literally laughed out loud!
No words

The fact that it works is - ***mwah***
absolute madlad
Only in kerbal
Elon, this is what "going Kerbal" REALLY means!

I love all the explosions at the launch. Even if everything is perfect there's explosions in this game. 
Everytime I think ive seen it all, someone goes and does something like this
*Elon furiously writing things down as fast as he can while watching the gif* 
>Breaking News : Elon Musk buy the little videogame develloper Squat, and force an obligatory patch for the game Kerbal Space Program, removing the "Revert to Vehicule Assembly" feature and adding a Kerbal's Union obligating the players to take extreme caution measures if they want to hire some astronauts and don't want to be sued to death !  
The CEO later declared in a press conference the mysterious phrase : "Checkmate, Daniel." 
Cool setup! One question: How do you keep the fairing open on one end. I simply cannot make that work.
Elon wants to do a thing, so I made a thing ;)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEI79WXzww
It's been like two days since the announcement. I expect a giant Jaeger stepping on the car on Duna by Monday afternoon. 
I attempted 70 times to go to the moon.

71 failed 
This is amazingly kerbal
Very well made gif!
What game is this
[deleted]
Wow that is some amazing stuff, the most I've achieved is leaving 4 kerbals to an unfortunate fate of drifting through the deepest reaches of space for eternity. 
That lifting the rocket to vertical is a thing of beauty.
From someone who has never seen anything on this game only heard about how much people seem to like playing it, this looks fucking crazy..
Please. Someone tweet him this. 
Wow Elon, I actually always suspected you play this game.
I can't read the link to your youtube channel, can you make it bigger? Thanks.
/u/ElonMuskOfficial
This is great. I love the on-ground loading
What game/program is this?

Edit: Fount it. Did 2 clicks worth of research...
Never played this game but it looks really fun... Does it take a while to get started knowing the basics to be able to do anything significant?
The kerbal style to raise a rocket
I have 230 hours on the game and I can't even launch normally wtf
You win
Not impressed until you can make a SST(Mars)O Tesla.
You might want to send this to EJ_SA on Twitter. He's been trying to do something similar on stream for a while now.
M, A, R, S, we goin' to *Mars* bitches! Red rocks!
dat url doe
Technically, this is KSP going Elon.
These videos are great but kinda depressing :-). I've been playing KSP for years and can barely get to the Mun and I've never seen the other planets. 
I hope Elon teases all kinds of payloads for FH, then admits what it really is just before launch that he actually  wanted to see all those things done in KSP.
Maaaaann,  you can't get that DoD cert unless you vertically integrate. 
holy fuck
Can we have a video series of Elon figuring out how to go to mars in KSP?
Excellent work, catchy music, great piece overall.
People can manage this, and I crash and burn before leaving atmosphere every time.....
The video is even more fantastic 
Nice one Kim 
I haven't played KSP in a looong time... is this all possible in the standard game or were mods used?
Looks impressive... until you realize it’s a one way trip. Edit: It would be much more funny if you had the Kerbal in the ride all along.

I didn’t notice that the car was already unmanned until I watched the video.
You, sir, are a true Kerbal.

Well done.
I thought it was going to land on north Korea.
OK, the launcher truck is really impressive.
Damn, I really want to try and make a reusable first stage like this.  Anyone know how it's feasible while trying to get your payload stage into orbit?  I feel like you'd need the payload to be doing a burn at the apoapsis to achieve orbit, but meanwhile you'd have to also be switching to and controlling the first stage descent?  Seems a difficult situation.  Unless the first stage already achieved orbit and just did a retro burn (but that seems really inefficient).
EAT YOUR HEART OUT ELON
I’ve never seen anyone make it out of the atmosphere, this is cool.
I can barely make it to the Mun, and then there's this....
This is just amazing :D
What cannot be done in this game gosh
The part I'm finding incredible is how you got that last stage from KEO to Duna. How much D.V. is in that little tank?
What mods are you using?

Fantastically well done.
Holy shit  
That's amazing
What is the song? It has been stuck in my head for an hour.

Preempting the /r/all appearance - **What is Kerbal Space Program?**

[Official 1.0 Release trailer
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kTbo1wmN-w)

Kerbal Space Program is a rocket/plane building game where you send little green men(and now women!) to space. Your goal is to design, build, and launch your own spacecraft or airplanes. We've got rockets, fuel tanks, solar panels, powered wheels, heatshields, parachutes, command pods, and a lot more.

There are three modes: 

Career, where you collect Science to unlock parts and complete missions to collect funds that will help you build your spacecrafts and work to build your little startup space company into the space program of an entire world.

Science mode, which is just like career, but all you have to worry about is science, and no funds.

and Sandbox, where you have free reign to create all the spacey(or otherwise) creations your heart desires!

In this update we've recieved female Kerbals, a new aerodynamics mode, possible overheating of parts(deadly re-entry), fairings, resource scanning and drilling, and more!

This game has an incredibly active modding community, letting you add things like attachment ropes, autopilots, new parts, lasers, weapons, motorized parts, and even new planets and solar systems!

[List of mods already updated to 1.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3420og/already_10_updatedcompatible_mods/)

[This fan-made trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkDOOsGg-9I&hd=1) is one of my favorites of all time, created by Shaun Esau!

Reddit has also officially ranked /r/KerbalSpaceProgram one of the most supportive communities on the site, with subreddits and users like /r/KerbalAcademy and /u/illectro (Scott Manley)

Hopefully this helps all you confused onlookers!

Post layout was inspired by /u/SuperSeniorComicGuy's post on the Beta Than Ever post.

A few edits:

**#1 on /r/all!**

Thanks for the gold!

/u/NewbornMuse mentions:
>I think it bears mentioning explicitly that the physics of this game are very realistic. You have to learn orbital mechanics (don't worry, there's a tutorial!). If you want to dock with your space station that's flying a bit ahead of you, you have to decelerate. Why? Play and find out.

/u/Kabloski says:

>I'd also add that the learning curve is STEEP. You're going to blow up/get lost/run out of fuel a lot before having any major successes, but when you accomplish something...
When I was a kid and I beat Super Mario Brothers on the NES, I ran to grab my mom because I needed someone to see what I'd done. That was a feeling I thought I'd never have again- until my first Mun landing in KSP (My wife pretended to be just as impressed as my mom had). It really is that good.

/u/aixenprovence adds:

>I think it may be worth adding that a lot of the attraction of the game comes from the modeling of real rocketry and real orbital physics. You don't have to know what an Hohmann Transfer is, or the Oberth effect, but you can learn about them using the game, and knowing about them will make you a better player.
Blowing up a series of (brave, but sadly doomed) little green guys while you learn about rocketry is a huge amount of fun.

    We're releasing on time
    So I'm glad I got blown
    Think of all the things we learned
    With the Kerbals who are still alive!
So is this the official one? This is the one we upvote right?

Was a great experience.

My download is finishing, I will be in my bunk.

Congratulations. To all of us and all of you.

Great, I have to hand in a paper on Monday...
Guess I´ll take that class again next semester.
[Valentina's body wasn't quite ready](http://i.imgur.com/t7ptwsv.jpg)
To the front page!
Boys and girls, it's been fun hyping with you. Now we must go and do our duty
lets kill some space frogs boys and girls
Still Server Migration on their website :(
> ‘Elon Kerman’ added to name pool.
I was literally about to eat dinner, guess it's going cold tonight...   
Cheers Squad! :D
It starts insanely fast, like 30s or so? Great job.
And lo, it was so
finally! i waited since 0.12 for this moment :D
This is pretty cool. A quick glace at the release notes and i found this. "The Science Lab has been retooled to run long-term research on experiment data, providing much higher amounts of science over time." That sounds pretty cool for a potential science space station option. 
I've got 2 extra copies of KSP from a Steam sale a lonnnng time ago that I originally bought for my Dad and brother, but neither of them were ever interested.  So, if you want a copy, post here!

Bonus points if you have any documented (Reddit post history) interest in this game and/or an interest in space/science in general and are in need of a copy.  Feel free to post any other relevant info about your situation. I'll pick 1 or 2 out to send Steam keys to.

*I say "documented interest" because though I want to spread the kerbal love, I want to do so to someone who has show interest and is likely to contribute to the KSP community.*  :)
Website still down. I don't have it on steam...
*closes curtains, puts cat outside, locks door, and looks at the big pile of snacks* see you in a few days :D
There are a lot of frustrating and disappointing uses of Early Access, and similar 'buy this game before it is finished' systems. 

Kerbal Space Program makes them all worth it though, such a perfect example of early access done properly. I can't wait to crash my ore mining rocket into the Mun!
Aerodynamics + heat + limited part counts in Career mode = super hard mode. Yes, I'd like to put nose cones on those boosters, but part counts say no and I can't afford a bigger VAB yet :(

Also aerodynamics have some unexpected side effects... many Kerbals have died. Loss of capsule control on re-entry is now a thing (that will end with a barbeque).

Congratulations, Squad, for making an incredible game and an incredible community! 
WOO! THANK THE KERBAL LORD I TOOK THIS WEEK OF WORK!

Now, time to kill some kerbals!
I am downloading it right now!!
Oh my god I can't contain myself! I have an exam tomorrow and I'm seriously weighing my options
It's so beautiful ^they ^^should ^^^have ^^^sent ^^^^a ^^^^^poet
"Hey boss? I'm feeling ill..."
I just noticed that the legal disclaimer on the Steam page still says the game is in Alpha... time to get that updated, perhaps? :P

250 upvotes in 5 mins. That has to be a record. 
Edit 1k in 20
So do I have to wait for the Squad site to come back up to download it without Steam?
I am so incredibly hyped to buy this game. This is a problem, since I already bought it about a year ago, so...

Anyone still need a copy? Or have like, a nerdy sibling that would like one? I'm not kidding. I'll buy someone a copy.
No not today! I have 4 assignments due this week!!!!!



Welp looks like I'm redoing this semester.
> Be careful when flying aircraft in this new update: stalls are now properly simulated as well, and spontaneous craft disassembly during high-G maneuvers is now a very real thing.

There's now Elon Kerman! Source: changelog
It is also the feature for Steam's store, at least for me in the US.

For all those redditers seeing this post wondering what all the fuss is about with Kerbal Space Program I'll only say one thing :

It's the best thing since Lego. 

Yes, it's just THAT good. 
It's simply.... one of the best games EVER MADE!
And of course this happens right before finals.  I guess I don't really need to pass all my classes.
Que the little girls squeal!!!
My F5 key almost gave up!
Goodbye degree. I barely knew you.
First Early Access game I purchased two years ago in years; easily the best experience and my favorite team.  Excitement and a sense of devs and backers "in it together" all the way up until the release.  

Well done.
My god. It's full of parts.

Hey /u/wave100,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Gentlekerbals,

I have heard nothing but great things about your cosmic ambitions, and so I am enlisting in the glorious KSP.

How do you turn this thing on?
It's about time I learn how to dock without using cheats.
I've encountered a pretty um.  Hardmode bug.  

Tried to remap my staging key from space to enter.  It let me clear the assignment okay, but won't accept any key to bind it to now.  Undeterred, I have simply been launching all my rockets without staging.  

-edit:  I caused my own problem it seems!  I deleted the game folder, then steam only put the updated information in.  I was wondering why it took literally 2 seconds to load.  If anything though, it speaks to how impressive and far reaching this update is, for the game to run with ONLY the updated files.
I don't know why I was here at work F5ing for the past half hour.

I wont be able to play it until I get home in 7 hours, and even then I'll probably not get much more than a half hour in tonight.

All you kids with homework and finals you can put off are lucky. Adult hood sucks sometimes.
This is gonna hit /r/all so fucking fast!
OMG
And here I am just sitting in class :/
It's here!
RIP SLEEP!
Woooo!!!
Update Queued :*(
Too much hype to handle with everything planned this week.
YES!
There's the download I've been waiting for!
aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well who needs to do well on their finals anyway am I right?
Like a rocket steered by fearless Jeb, this is going TO THE TOP! 
Looks like I'm calling in sick today.
IT'S HERE! 
Let's do SCIENCE.
Congrats Squad!
Wooo!

Wish I didn't already have plans for tonight. Scrapping plans for tomorrow for some KSP! 
I picked the wrong weekend to destroy my back... I can't even sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes. I have a doctor's appointment today, family practitioner, give me strength!
So much for May, and my summer, and any other game I was planning to play ever.
Ladies and Gentlemen.... Start your Rockets!
Really wish I had the money to get this right now.
I'll use this as a study guide for my physics final next week.
I just joined this sub when I saw the announcement... I need to sit down and get my rocketry together! 

I bought the game a few months ago but, I think I only messed around with it for one weekend and was never able to acheive orbit in career mode. I kept making it about halfway around the globe and then splashing back down.

I didn't spend a lot of time with it learning all the details. I just went through the tutorial. But now with the update and all the new toys, I'm definitely anxious to get into it again!
Front page in less than 20 min. New record??
4 hours till I get home...Dangit. Too long to wait.
/r/all countdown

Edit: 18...16...15...13...11...10...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...**WE HAVE LIFTOFF REDDIT**
Remember to study for exams before spending days on end in this game. 
For everyone still getting the maintenance message on the ksp store, either set your DNS to google's server (8.8.8.8) or use the direct IP https://85.236.103.6/ (gives certificate and lots of graphical errors, but works in a pinch. Use Tab to get into the password field and Enter to submit).

Your default DNS Server (ISP and/or Router) probably cached the old IP, and will take some time to update.
I fired it up briefly, mostly to see if Steam actually had downloaded 1.0 yet or not. (I couldn't figure out how to see the current version otherwise.) I thought I'd try the new aerodynamics and airplane parts while I was in there. I built a quick three-engined airplane, throttled up, then exploded as it got up to speed because I didn't build it well and it ripped itself to pieces.

10/10.

I'm excited for Valentina and her female compatriots. My daughter loves the game and I can't wait to show her that it's not just filled with boys now.
Wow. 50 upvotes/minute for 40 minutes and gold.
Coming in a bit too steep, watching the chute overheat, wondering when the flames'll stop and if that'll happen before you hit the ground... it really adds a whole new layer of pants-shitting terror.
Awesome.  I bought this a year ago.  Have they developed anything that shows you what the fuck is going on and how to play the "game", like a manual or tutorial that's updated for the new content?
If somebody is interested in a **list of already 1.0 updated or compatible mods**...  
I am currently putting together one [**in this thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3420og/already_10_updatedcompatible_mods/).
Ahh! 3 hours left of work!
I don't think I've ever felt smarter when playing a video game than when I figured out how to burn for an orbital rendezvous on my own, then found out that my system is the same as the one used to get the Space Shuttle/Soyuz to the International Space Station. This game is incredible!
I never played or even seen gameplay if this game before, would it be a good time to pick it up? 
Is there heat shields for craft that do not have a circle base? Like space planes or shuttles?  
Nr 1 on all, less than an hour in.

You guys <3
Why don't airbrakes brake in the air but only on ground :(
This is finals week for me. It's going to be so hard to resist the temptation. But I shall wait until Friday.
[removed]
Valentina Kerman is orange! yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
But finals.
I've been on board this hype train starting at version .11. I am so glad I got on so early and watched this game evolve into what it is today. Good Job Squad. Looking forward to seeing where we go from here. 
Came here at vers. .13 for $13.00 Best video game I've ever bought.
Very seriously thinking of calling in sick...
Hear that? That is the sound of thousands of GPAs crying out and suddenly...silence. Wait....is that the roar of an engine? GOD DAMMIT JEB! NO MAKJNG ICE CREAM RUNS WITH VALENTIA IN A GOD DAMMN HEAVY LIFT ROCKET! 


//2 hours later, in the directors office....
Jeb, are you telling me this was Valentia's idea? NONSENSE! *loud rumbles as Valentina does doughnuts in a rocket* GOD DAMMIT NOT AGAIN 
All I'd like to say is, Thanks Squad.
Will they keep updating?

This is a game I would love to get into. Running your own space programme sounds so fun and cool, and I love the enthusiasm from all its fans :) But when I load it up it just seems so complex, and I'm completely lost. 
After years of having this game and shooting rockets more or less randomly into orbit and to the mun in the sandbox, today I finally started the career mode. 

Not that it's 1.0 I have motivation to start really getting into this litte gem. Never docked anything to anything and never landed on anything but the mun (and kerbin of course).

What I'm trying to say is: Thank you for making this awesome piece of software that even if I barley touched the surface of it I am extremly fascinated by it.
Yeah I had to do the same thing, and it worked.
Anyone have most of there ships broken? Also, a lot of parts are missing textures and are either white or black.
I see people bitching about how early access games are shit.

Well, put this game and its early access process right next to Minecraft.  That is to say, this game proves the concept can work.  You just need devs that actually care about the game they are working on.

Glad to see this out and incredibly happy to have got into early access and support the team early on.

Thanks guys.
Awesome!
Yesterday I made a plane to test out the new aerodynamics model.

I built and flew with a plane (in sandbox) and did a sharp turn which caused the plane to fall apart. For fun I ejected the kerbal to attempt to bounce him on kerbin. The bounce succeeded at around 50-60 m/s and continued to bounce until stationary, but when the kerbal stood up he fell through the ground and this somehow triggered the whole kerbol system to disappear. 

Now whenever I start a new game everything is gone, all I see is the stars background. Is there any possibility of recovery or do I have to re-install the game?
Last week my save became corrupted, I was devastated.

I just downloaded 1.0 and my save works again! Praise Jebus!

We have liftoff! Congrats Squad and well done!
TOP POST ALL TIME LET'S DO IT
FINALY NO MORE F5!
My mods :(
I got no work for three days! Sweet sweet joy.

Come on download...
Meh 


/jk...
Goodbye sleep. ....
Congrats. I feel I have witnessed something magical...
Steam: "Update Queued"

Rebel Rockets Mission Control: "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
Changelog?
Oh baby, Ready to launch in approximately: 0 seconds
I haven't played in a while but KSP was already really good then; I am going to have to make some time to play in 1.0
Still Server Migration. Now I feel punished for having the non steam version. :(
I'm in Italy. Website is still down from here.
**WHY?**
Good buy world!
Maximum hype achieved, we have liftoff!
It's happening!!!
Excellent. /r/ksptomars should launch soon now
[removed]
we got lift-off!!!
Just when my semester ends. Perfect timing =)
And I am still at work for 3 and a half more hours!! >_<

You guys will be on Duna by the time I get home from work!


Sweet!  Only a five-minute download... in before the stampede!
Thanks to /u/FreakyCheeseMan for the gold!

Edit: And /u/StringEpsilon!
[Squad: Please fix your SSL certificate.](http://i.imgur.com/UJVrfW4.png)


[Me as I leave the office and headed home](http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Office.gif)...perhaps never to be heard from again. 
This masterpiece has come along way since i started playing and i'm incredibly happy to see that it has turned out so well. 

Congrats on the relase squad!
Waiting on Steam
1.0 cured my ship of the Kraken!



Unlimited Power!

Now fly with it
[deleted]
Does it actually work in KSP?
we do a little trolling
Perpetual motion machine?

You tempt the Kraken!
Mount Jeb to the spinny bit, spin up to full speed and eject him into orbit.
Problem?
Holy shit that's good
[deleted]
Willing to bet, even with how large these are, a reaction wheel would still be more in-game effecient for turning a ship than these.
I'm dumb af, what's stopping this in the real world, physics?
It's a Kraken Drive!
could this be used to make a space station spin for artificial gravity? In KSP of course...
*clap clap clap*
Power companies will go bankrupt
Now turn it sideways and make a Kraken-copter!
Don't show this to Electroboom or there will be blood.
@all wind turbine companies
God damn kraken power
I was not paying attention and assumed from the title this was r/prequelmemes
Lmao I fucking love this sub y'all are the best
Petition to make the docking magnets consume power
I see this, and i raise you:

1 (one) rtg
What would make this better is the docking music from interstellar.
absolutely thrilled to see trollphysics here. i feel like i’m in high school again.
Could you do something like this on a real scale?
POWER!!! UNLIMITED POWER!!!
Congrats on reaching 10th top of all time!
Sadly this wont work in real life
Does anyone have tutorial for this
Helicopter
Waiting for Stratenblitz to get something to orbit by using this
Troll phyics
Fucking magnets, how do they work?
Brilliant
Perpetual motion machine!!!
When I was little I legitimately thought that would work
kraken drive technology.. i never thought this day would come.....
haha thats cool, wouldnt have expected that effect
Your a fricking genius
I hate it. Have my award.
lol that's genius!  Never thought of trying that.
Troll physic !!!!
Maybe if you used four arms instead of two you could.... wait, nevermind.
So um... I think you just solved climate change! Good job buddy!!
Troll physics: Infinite rotation/Eletricity.
Yo just make a more compact version and put rotors on each end and boom, h e l i c o p t e r
Someone needs to make a plane with thsi
You did it!
Smart people, why wouldn’t this work irl, because I know it won’t, but WHY
You've gotta be shitting me.
Magnets were just Come together and it wouldn’t move I’m only Seventh grader and I know this
Need to upload again with the Anakin “it’s working” audio over top of it
When you choose to ignore Newtons third law:
Could you generate electric charge this way?
Troll physics: infinite power
This was the basis of the most recent [Kraken Drive](https://youtu.be/28v9dnP65Mw). You can control the speed by adjusting the docking force. Makes for good UFO-like craft.
That would be awesome if it was physically possible. If there is equal force on both sides then it wouldn’t turn at all. If one side has slightly more force then it could potentially be possible
I know this violates all the physics, but I really hope someone can discover a way to get perpetual motion machines to become a reality.
Would this actually work in real life?
Wait, is this real?  
(I know it would never be possibble irl)
That's not how magnetism works the bosons would balance the whole system
Next step, build many more
FBI would like to know your location.
u/savevideo
That works??!!  That truly works?!?! America, take note!!!
Many people are saying about reasons why it won't work in reallife. Now if u consider magnets and the rigidframe as a system then magnetic forces are internal forces. If intially system is in rest. If u want it to rotate then u need to give it torque. And torque is integral of F.dx and here F is 
External force.

Since there no extarnal force there will not be any tourqe.

In case of windmills wind acts as external force and produce tourqe.
Is that axel stock? I haven’t played in a while, but last I did, it was impossible to make an axel with out a tedious hack.
u/savevideo
if ooonnnllyyy we could get unlimited electricity with this in real life
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
I see the RPM increasing, how fast does it go?
Rotor?
Have you never heard of a kraken drive?
this would make both Newton and Carnot cringe
If it works in KSP it must work in real life
How?
[*PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtrn4vvTkk&ab_channel=CollegeHumor)
what mods does this require?
Would this work irl tho?
There’s no way that would work
Does this have a chance to work irl?
Kraken square
Is this possible or is it against Isaac Newton’s laws?
Can someone tell me why this wouldnt work
So here’s the real question. What is it about the game’s physics engine is wrong that allows for this?
okay but why wouldn’t that first pic work?
Why isn’t this a thing in real life instead of wind power?
Mom: we have perpetual motion machine at home.
Perpetual motion machine at home.......
I knew it, Kraken is the solution to the energy crisis.
Such genus
That is a good idea
How do you make it stop?
Wait does this actually work, Im dumb af
Any scientists that can ELI5 why this is not possible irl?
Someone make this ASAP!
It's free energy
now i wanna see an actual thing irl power something with that logic…. because it seems like it work
How to make this (I don't know out of this video)?
Why hasn’t this been put in the real world
u/savevideo
I think the game didn't account for the fact magnets pull and get pulled
Funny af boi
u/savevideobot
u/savevideo
[removed]
Even if this machine would move, which people have said it wouldn’t, it would not be perpetual motion because the energy is coming from the magnets. At best this would be a way to turn magnetic energy into kinetic energy.
Strap in boys, We are going full anime

Yesterday i landed on the mun.
It's not Macross as long as nobody launches several dozens of rockets at once.
I like how it appears to explode every time it transforms.
Jesus, I'm in shock. What even is KSP anymore?

edit: i've never gotten this many upvotes guys you're gonna give me a stroke
Holy shit that's amazing. 


Teach me sensei ; - ;
You built a Macross Variable Fighter in a rocketry simulator. You are a god.
And here i am, not able to make just a normal plane.
This single gif is better than the last three transformers movies.
We Full Macross boys.
get in the fucking robot, jeb, or we'll make valentina pilot it.
We must fight

This gave me a Red Alert 3 feeling [Mecha/Jet Tengu](http://media.moddb.com/images/members/1/60/59757/TenguRevisions.jpg)

How did you do it and what mods are you using?
Umm... Full anime ... another static parody on anime robots... ok lets look...

(...)


:-o

I need to change my pants... 





"It worked in kerbal space program!"
"Jesus goddamn Christ are you fucking serious?" - me, just now.

Why? How???

**Edit**: Yeah, I know it uses mods, smartasses. But still, this must've taken so much work!!
Can I get a mod list, OP?
Now just make a fully transforming SDF-1 or Battle 7 and I'm sold.

Well, I mea, this is so amazing I'm already sold. Any plans to make some of the later Valkyries like the YF-19 or VF-22?
Harmony Gold lawsuit in 3....2....
Now bring it to Laythe
Wait, what game is this?
You built a Veritech fighter in what amounts to a very fancy backyard with a box of scraps. You must tell me how you did it.

Wow.
DUDE! YOU GOT TO SHARE THIS ON KERBAL X!!!!   WooT!!!!  Great job, this looks cool as hell!

I like the face of Motrix Kerman in the right corner. Very descriptive! 
Welcome to your [fanclub](https://youtu.be/3o_E0IvRorI).
Now the question is... Jeb plays Max, or Hikaru? ;) 
I still can't even land on the Mun.
Damnit, I'm at work. Stop distracting me with your sorcery.
This is one of the best posts I've seen in a very long time... And I lurk here a lot. I'll read up top comments for mods and if you're on 1.2 already, but I had to personally give you my props for this. 

This tickles so many of my fancies. I hope you post a craft file! Thanks!
I don't regularly come to this sub, but I still looked for /u/jatwaa's face in the corner to see if he had created this thing.
If you haven't, you should post this over at /r/macross and /r/robotech 
My jaw is on a collision course with the earth's core. Nice work!
jesus holy fucking christ our lord what did i just watch.

Hi /r/all! 
VR please
I love you OP <3
The celebratory backflip at the end really makes it, intentional or otherwise.
Wait, Kerbal can do this?
Easily one of the best things in video gaming. You got my praising sir.
My cooks so hard it feels like it's going to be a overcooked hot dog in a microwave
I can land on Minmus. I even make it back occasionally, too!
[Best game ever.](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/1099f374-e56d-4531-acb4-4241b19e1c69)
I request a full explanation video or at the very least a detailed album. Including what mods you are using, did you have to turn indestructibility on and so on.
And then I reinstalled KSP.
You got these people doing this awesome insane shit... mean while I tried to land on jool.... (how do you think that went?)
It even transforms correctly.... christ! :D
What, no [GERWALK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VF-1_Valkyrie#GERWALK_mode)? I am disappoint.
I made a rocket once.  It crashed.
I can't stop rewatching it.. i can't..
Would love to see a [Macross YF-19](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/macross/images/9/9c/YF19_Fighter-GERWALK-Battroid.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110911152233).

Link to the building and testing of this btw. Gives you a better appreciation of the work that went into this.
Did you ever play GunMetal? Because this is exactly that and it's awesome!
Back in my day, these were called transformers. Get off my lawn.
Very impressive!
How.... 
How? How are you able to transform it so fast? What mods?
I Approve. 
Reminds me of a game called Gun Metal

I remember I got full version from a polish gaming magazine. It was sooo good. Pretty as hell too. 
hoolee shiat
Has a combined mech and flight sim ever been done?
What game is this?

i made a plane today... and it even took off.. im proud of myself...
Holy crap this is so cool!
I just....i can't....I don't......how.....sigh

Seeing these awesome screenshots and gifs with all those mod icons and i'm just like... "What the heck are all of those? I run with maybe 2 or 3 of those icons"  with my 20 parts packs installed.
There are weapons in KSP now?
I like kerman's expression.
And here I am barely able to land on the mun... 
and here I am, I cant even get a good orbit around the earth.
And here I am barely able to get to the moon
Motrix Kerman: "Go Go gadget gatling gun!"
Do it on Besiege and then I'll really be impressed 
Motrix doesn't look happy. 
and here my airplanes barely take off
All I can do in kerbal is make a jet so small and so fast that it burns up in atmosphere.
I am kind of amazed that stress doesn't tear that apart.
Holy shit
[deleted]
Slow motion?
That's it, that's fucking it. I'm reinstalling this game.
I love the look on the Kerbal pilot's face. She's like "oh fuck what the fuck is happening fuck" 
Sick Kerbal skillz bruh!
Literally transformers 
Reminds me strongly of "[Thexder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thexder)" if any of y'all are old enough to have played that.
I suck at this game, so hard.
Could we get another gif with the Debug Aeronautic Forces overlay on (showing lift and drag) during a transformation. I'd love to see forces this thing is experiencing when you hit the button
I regret that I only have one upvote to give and no gold to give.
So if it's possible in KSP then it is possible in real life right? The military is holding out on us. 
KSP2
Holy shit
***AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***
It definitely looks ambitious, if the preview is anything to go by.
[deleted]
We Moonbase Alpha now
INTERSTELLAR, BASEBUILDING, NEW GRAPHICS

IM FREAKING OUT, SOMEBODY HOLD ME

EDIT: and it has MULTIPLAYER TOO?!?!?!
This came out of fucking nowhere
A tribute to Build Fly Dream was the best thing they could have possibly done for that trailer
How do I break it to my family that I wont be seeing them for a while?
Not being made by Squad, which is curious.
The ending was perfect, just like all my launches 90% of the flight goes perfect and then it all goes to shit.
I was just playing KSP last night and thought to myself: how the **** is it possible that this game does not have a sequel or been ripped off by anyone? I mean it's not just the best game in class, it's the ONLY game in its class. 

I was so heartened to see from the Dev trailer that it seems like this team really gets it. Kerbal is about learning orbital mechanics without meaning to. Kerbal is about learning by failing, and the failing is more hilarious than frustrating (though... yea, it's also frustrating). 

Cannot wait.
No nut august just failed
"We can confirm that there will be no in-game currency or loot boxes, and we will look to follow a similiar fotmat to the post-launch support of the original game" - Kerbal Space Program in a reply to Matt Lowne holyshit
What the hell? This was just as unexpected as the new Microsoft Flight Simulator announced on E3.

~~Hopefully there is mod support just as good as in KSP1. But I am going to be pessimist on that and say not a change for that.~~

edit: [Modding support confirmed!](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/game/kerbal-space-program-2/) Now I am excited!
Totally unexpected. I'm crying WTF. This made my day!
Who's developing the game though?
Man i was like "what is this space shit" and then i saw the landing legs
A steam page is up:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/954850/Kerbal_Space_Program_2/?snr=1_7_15__13

Not that that tells us if its going to be released there.

Also includes from screenshots, new additions seems to be interstellar travel, colonies( seems to be base building and resource collection), and multiplayer
Hoping for a Linux version!
It's on steam, and has the multiplayer tag
https://i.imgur.com/fGBtpYY.png
I thought it was an april fools joke, but I realized that it's august.

Well, well, Squad, take my money again.
The timing of this is weird - Breaking Ground really just came out.  I haven't bought it yet.

Now... why would I bother?

I'm curious why they didn't wait until closer to release to announce this, rather than so far in advance that it's almost certainly going to cannibalize sales.
[deleted]
Dear dev’s,
As much as people complain about the kraken, please do not discard our belovedly hated mysterious entity of chaos and destruction.
No... No nonononoonon PLEASE! I JUST GOT MY LIFE BACK!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Timewarping to release
It's ambitious but if it delivers this will be my favorite game of all time
Kraken: “I am inevitable
M83 - Outro fit so well with that reveal trailer. Gave it an insanely epic feel. I haven't played that much KSP but it got me hyped af.
I saw it in class and almost shit myself out of excitement.
I'm sure I saw a nuclear pulse rocket!
1 thing

DON'T BE AN EPIC GAMES EXCLUSIVE!
I was really not expecting that
O MY GOD YES. Btw:  

*Q: What type of physics can players expect? Advanced, realistic, etc?*

A: Realistic vehicle physics and orbital mechanics continue to be at the center of the Kerbal experience. We've focused on optimizing vehicle physics  to allow for the smooth simulation of larger structures on a wider variety of PCs. 
But what about my mods?
I love how on the [website](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/game/kerbal-space-program-2/) there's so much new stuff that even multiplayer is buried halfway down the announcement page, like KSP 2 could easily have been the first one with new textures and multiplayer, but no, they go and add literally everything you could possibly want to the game.
OH MY GOD, It looks so amazing
I actually can't believe this. I'm so fucking happy right now.
I just bought the first one ~~don't mind the fact that it was a month ago~~ and now they're announcing the second one
I love this game! I'm a hyper casual and could never figure out much of the trajectory planning so I would always load up wayyyy too much fuel because the only way I was ever getting to Mun was if I "eye-ball'd it". 

Losing dozens of Kerbals to deep space was a risk I was willing to take, in the name of science. I don't think I have had a game that made me feel as accomplished as KSP when I managed to get one of those little green spaceman corpses all the way to Mun. 

Maybe in KSP II I can get them their while their still breathing!
Has it really been over 2 years?
I wish I could get excited but the amount of shit games being released lately kinda makes me doubt if it'll come close to the first one. Isn't Take-Two running things as well? They believe there isn't enough microtransactions in GTA 5. I'd imaigne we'll have to unbox parts if they're running things. 

Its a shame I can't get excited for news like this due to the history of developers over the last few years. Hopefully they'll prove me wrong.
Oh.  Dip.  Well... Hopefully it will live up to what makes ksp great.
I wonder if they are giving us original funders this one free? Or was that just the original ksp? No big deal either way. Love that game and what they have done. I bought my first copy in 2012 and have bought a few to give away here and there just to support them more.  If they so it means I'll buy 2 copies just to give away.
STILL NO CLOUDS ???????????????
I'm a grown ass man and this brought me to tears because this game means so much to me. There is just no game out there that compares to the satisfaction you get from this. I will never forget that late night in November of 2015 when I decided to do my first apollo style mun landing and realizing just how effective that mission design was. After I learned the full history of the Apollo Program I realized I was conducting very similar incremental missions building up to my own Mun landing.
Shit, son! We goin back to the Mun!
I don't know, I'm sort of skeptical. The photos on the steam page aren't too impressive, and the trailer is just animation, not gameplay.

I'm skeptical about Take2, and skeptical about the launch price. I wouldn't be surprised if it was £30+ to preorder, and then have to pay for DLCs or microtransactions down the line. Compare that to KSP - I think I paid less than £5, and I got every expansion since entirely free. 

Part of me even wonders if they're making this because sales for original KSP dried up (most of the people who would buy it now own it), so they're releasing what looks like a graphics pack to turn everyone who already bought KSP back into a customer, and to get out of all the free DLC agreements.
I still havent even landed on Duna :(
I AM SO FUCKING READY IT HURTS. BRING IT ON! WE SHALL RISE TOGETHER IN THE NAME OF THE HOLY TRINITY: THE MANLEY. THE KRAKEN. THE DELTA V.
\- Solar System**s**

\- Multiplayer

\- Improved Graphics

\- " New animated tutorials, improved UI, and fully revamped assembly and flight instructions "
Okay first of all, OH MY GOD!  


Anyway, I've been playing KSP since version .22. Watched through Scott Manley's Interstellar Quest, watched Matt Lowne's daring bunch of kerbalnauts save countless kerbals. Did Reddit challenges, and I can't say other than maybe Minecraft has any other game brought me this much joy. This came absolutely out of left field, and from the two trailers that have been released so far, I absolutely cannot wait for this game.  


I love you all and this wonderful community. I can't wait to see us all in the next iteration of this game.
Whelp, there goes my first marriage...
I was giggling away at the trailer, really hope they keep and build on the comedy. Also noticed the Project Daedalus type starship. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus
Guess who is definitely not buying breaking ground now
I don't want to alarm anyone but around 8:00 you can see a VR headset in the background
If it actually launches 2020, it's gonna be the best way to start a new decade!
this is why we don't build a border wall
I AM THROWING ALL OF MY MONEY AT THE SCREEN I AM SCREAMING
I can't say for certain, but it looks like they may be implementing some of Rover Dudes USI and MKS mods. At least in that cinematic trailer. I saw a malamute look-a-like rover and what looked like the USI habitat rings :D

I really hope they do, Rover Dudes mods are mandatory for me :)
From the trailers:  interstellar, off-world bases, resource management, and multiplayer.  All awesome but ambitious features built by independent developers in the original product as mods, but never stable enough to actually run without random kraken events and full game crashes, (at least on my rig).  I'm excited to see that ~~Squad~~.. ~~Take Two~~.. ~~Private Division~~.... *whatever they're calling the company now* is rolling these features into first-party code!  Props to them for looking at what mods the community is actually excited about and rolling those features into the baseline product.

Hopefully they've spent some time doing a rewrite of the base code as well to address some of the part limit and performance issues from the original product.  Seeing that the original core team is working on the product, I have good expectations that they won't just do what other software vendors do with their products; spend some work effort on making a more pretty version of the exact same code and slapping a "v (n+1)" sticker on the virtual box.

---

All-in-all: Is the alpha product available for purchase yet?  No?  ^...How ^'bout ^now ^^...now? ^^^...pretty ^^^please
In before Epic exclusive.... :(
So wtf is it? A polished CG trailer doesn't tell me much
It's a cinematic trailer remember. The real gameplay screenshots on Steam make it out to be a heavily modded KSP1 at best.
10 days from 3 year anniversary… we’re almost there … 6-8 months left
Star Citizen vibes lmao
This looks like it will be a combination of Factorio and KSP. Interplanetary rockets, space stations, and factories. Just look at all the new parts!
Trailer has Project Orion drives!
This game has so much potential it’s insane. I’m really hoping that they don’t blow it like No Mans Sky.
But I haven't landed on Mun yet!!
Nice. KSP finally out of early access. Maybe I can finally play a modded install and make it further than Minmus now.
Hopefully they get the overall architecture right from the beginning this time so mods aren't broken every update. TBH I'm more excited that this means they'll stop updating KSP1 and my life will cease being half playing ksp, half fucking around in CKAN trying to make things work.
Oh god gimme some VR support and I'll die happy
Can I get realistic looking materials (metals that look like metal?!), realistic looking atmospheres (light, clouds, fog, haze) and realistic looking terrains? Thank you, that would be a dream!
Fingers crossed for Linux/SteamOS support.
I hope we'll be able to walk around in the biosphere-type habitats. I just love scenery.
Holy shit. I haven't gotten particularly excited about an upcoming game for years, If theyre good then cool, if not then oh well. 

But I think I might just allow myself to become a rabid fan for this one...
Honestly now, who was even expecting ANYTHING like this? WOW
It's late August, and I literally had to take a moment to figure out whether it was April 1st today.
Oh boy here I go buying again.
You realize this is just T2 trying to make their money on the IP they bought right? This is purely their way around having the DLC unavailable for them to monetize to the majority of the population. I know you all love KSP but do yourself a favor and take this all with a grain of salt.
Never done this before, but I'm buying on day one.
KSP is like Eve Online and Dwarf Fortress to me. I enjoy reading the stories that come out of it but it seems to daunting for me to actually play, although I did eventually dabble in both of the others.

It looks like it's time for me to dip my toes in the KSP pool too.
I don't know if this is known but one of the devs just said in an interview that we get orbital Rocket Construction. So we can build a rocket in space
I need a new computer.
O M G

IM ABOUT TO CUM
