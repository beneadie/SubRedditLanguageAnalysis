Just finished Arrival (2016), and it is the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. "A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world."

I love this movie. A unique take on an “alien invasion”
Yea its great! Can't wait for Dune, same director
This movie makes me cry buckets every time I watch it and it's why I have such faith in Denis Villeneuve to direct Dune. If anyone can do intellectual, thematically heavy sci-fi, it's Villeneuve.
if you havent seen contact, you should.  its similar in many ways.  all good.
My favorite movie of all time.
Is that the actor who plays Hawk Guy in the Avengers movies?
Check out the short story “Story of your Life” by Ted Chiang the movie is based on the same
I loved that movie. Another you might enjoy is Annihilation. Thought provoking in the same kind of way as Arrival.
Saw it in theaters and wasn’t impressed because I was under the impression that is was gonna be an action movie. 

Saw it again at home a month ago and was blown away. Such a beautiful movie!
Watched it back when it was released and now as a linguistics undergrad. Different experiences.

100% agreed. I'm a big fan of sci-fi classics but this movie is something else.
This is one of my favorites ever. It’s absolutely stunning and brilliant. A lot of people don’t see it tho.
It's an extremely good movie agreed 👍
My favourite sci-fi movie too! Love the concept and the execution! On top of being an amazing sci-fi story, it is brilliantly shot and some of the frames just take your breathe away! Villeneuve is amazing!!!!
I'm in the minority here, but I didn't like Arrival. Without knowing that it's based on a short story, it's obvious that that's the case. Pretty much every short story I've read, or short film I've seen, ends without any kind of resolution, and I found that Arrival was the same. It felt like a short story that they dragged out to feature length without making any changes to adapt it to that format. It could have been 20-30 minutes long without losing anything.
score by johann johannason, RIP
don't want to be a dick, but If that's the best scifi movie you have ever seen, you are in for a treat... there are so many better ones out there.. try 2001, Solaris, Stalker, Ghost in the Shell(95), 12 Monkeys, Akira, the fly, Blade runner(82)..
I love the idea of Arrival more than I love Arrival.
Watch annihilation
I absolutely loved Arrival first viewing. Loved almost everything about it. Then I rewatched it the other day, and it felt full of holes, scenes improbable, and the characters felt shallow. Maybe gotta watch it a third time in a year's time to "re-discover" it.

(edit: the whole deciphering of the circles was grossly undertold, not even to Stargate 'standards', her whole linguistic field was merely summarized into a few snappy comebacks, really too bad)

Maybe it's the same as with Contact. First you love it, then you discover it's far from perfect, then you decide it doesn't have to be, it's a piece of art. I love Contact.

I'm worried about rewatching Interstellar now. Don't care about the haters, I'm a big fan of both the premise and the execution. So far, after one viewing.

Gotta give it to Arrival though, that "moment" when the plot starts to thicken, and she's running on a hunch, that's thrilling and beautiful as none other, and the premise is mind blowing!
2001 is the only sci fi I'd rank above it. Absolutely spectacular film.
The sound effects are lit 🔥
I don't know if i could go that far, but yeah it's very good.
Great film. The only time I wasn’t bothered to see Jeremy Renner.
Ted Chiang is something else. The other stories in the books are mind blowing as well.
Sci-fi movies and any form of speculative are the best! We get to explore things that would not be possible in real life. I still haven't seen Arrival but it's on my radar!
Not my favorite. It's one of those movies that I tend to forget. The story is meh. I think effects were nice.
Any other similar movie recommendations apart from contact and annihilation ?
I absolutely loved this film but the extremely slow pace of it overall did ruin it for me ngl
Eh... I honestly thought it was a bit over rated..
AMY Adams was great
Denis Villenueve has a way of making dark topics into beautiful pictures
The short story it's based on is even more interesting, with much more interesting linguistic concepts.

Included in Stories of your Life by Ted Chiang.
...I think you need to see more Sci Fi movies lol
I'm just gonna say this.

I majored in linguistics.
Imagine you like boxing.  You go to see a Rocky movie.  Instead of the training being a montage, the *fight* is a montage.  That's what this movie was like.

Also, deus ex ending.
Trigger warning: film has themes of terminally ill children. 

Spoiler, sorta: This is indeed a truly great sci-fi film, though it will forever boggle me that someone thought a great way to sermonize on "Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" was with pediatric cancer. Unless they were writing from personal experience, which I doubt they were, that was a shockingly tone-deaf dramatic choice. Like, totally jumping the shark in terms of dramatic license. Right up there with debating "how young IS too young?" at a dinner party.
Yeah not the best movie sci fi movie i have watched ill give it a 3 out 5
[deleted]
The best? Yeah? Not even Interstellar?
Best sci-fi movie ever?
i always wondered why it was twelve specifically
You should definitely read the book. There's some things that they changed.
[removed]
Sphere is kinda similar although more of a thriller
Forrest Whitaker looks so depressed on the poster. In fact, he usually looks really sad. Is Forrest Whitaker okay?
Same here! Especially love the theme at last (Spoiler alert(・o・) of how we should embrace the future no matter what (That's simply my own interpretation). Also it's really refreshing to see some realistic, logical scientific theories mixing with the plot. The first half of the film is boring, but the latter half is absolutely stunning. 

I can see a lot of comments suggested another movie similar to Arrival. Gonna check it out this summer!
Arrival and Interestellar became my favorite sci fi films of the last decade.
DV THE GAWD
can we please add this movie to the Barred Suggestions list?
Good film.
Oh I don’t think it was *the best* but I loved it too. It was mysterious and the events unfolded at a nice pace. The reveal in the movie got me.

going to rewatch it soon. 

My favorite alien movies are 

ET
Star Wars
Close Encounters 
Signs

I really got a lot out of Spielberg’s remake movie, War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise.
Who’d have thought an alien invasion movie about peaceful communication would be my favorite alien invasion movie
I've been saying this since it first dropped! In fact my alias on social was inspired by the palindrome that Louise gives her daughter HANNAH. each of my names is a palindrome. MAIRIAM ONITINO. The short story on which it's based "Story of your life" by Ted Chiang is a brilliant read too... And Villaneuve's adaptation is nothing short of astonishing. There's an article to that effect floating around the web somewhere...
Everyone loves this. Everyone. Except me.
Arrival is proof the Oscars hate Sci-Fi.
Great film, but sooooo inferior in its presentation to the short story, in my opinion. I mean, it’s hard to experience time the way the short story does, but I would have loved an attempt at that, not the half hearted flash forwards we kinda get sometimes. Also the hollywoodification was in full force. Still good, though.
I mean I'm glad you enjoyed it but personally it just didn't click with me. There are parts I liked, it was very well directed, the soundtrack was great, and the premise of trying to communicate with aliens was decently entertaining; but I just didn't feel any emotional attachment to it. Like I think I got what it was going for with its themes but the way it was done just didn't connect with me. I have enjoyed other stuff Villeneuve has worked on though, Blade Runner 2049 is one of my favorites.
I still think Edge of Tomorrow bests this.
One of the most frequently recommended movies on this sub. Literally once every few days
It was great but I couldn't understand how the president's wife's last words stopped him?
Can't unsee Jeremy Renner's massive hooter though

The Thing (1982) - If you're going to watch one horror movie tonight, make it The Thing. It is one of the best movies ever made and that's not just "best horror". Check it out!!

I showed this to some friends who had never heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. My buddy wouldn't stop talking about it for the next week and it sent him into a horror binge for like month.
I've been procrastinating for over an hour trying to decide on this or It: Chapter Two, guess I'll watch The Thing now then..
Have any of y’all seen “They Live” (1988)? I was looking for a Carpenter I haven’t seen for this evening and saw this on his filmography. Sounds sick, but I literally have never heard of it. I’m trying to decide between “They Live” and “The Exorcist” for tonight, both I haven’t seen.
Man, what an ending that was. Still a discussion topic today.
How many nightmares will I have after I watch this movie?
A thousand times yes!! And it has Wilfred "diabeedus" Brimley. So. F-in. Good.
Definitely my favorite movie. I also recommend Prince of Darkness by John Carpenter.
I've read that if you speak the language the crazed Norwegian that is shooting at the dog basically gives the suspenseful twist away. I guess maybe make sure you don't have English subtitles on when you watch it, lol.
Agreed, best horror movie ever made imo. I had the pleasure of seeing it in an empty theater with some friends a few weeks ago (social distanced of course).
Is it on any streaming services? I have seen a huge part of this movie and I’ve heard great things about it but I’ve never say down and watched it
Proper watching order:
The Thing From Another World (1951)
The Thing (2011)
The Thing (1982)

Save the best for last.
If you can find the special edition DVD with “the making of...” on it, I highly recommend you pick it up. Watching how they pulled off the practical effects is really interesting and fun to watch.
Fun fact: this movie is the first movie in Carpenter's [Apocalypse trilogy](https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/2/3279482/the-classics-john-carpenter-apocalypse-trilogy). The other two are Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness. I highly recommend all three. But The Thing is the best of the 3, imo.
This is also my favorite horror film. There's also a movie called LIFE (2017) and it's similar to the thing and it's so good.
What *is* so good about The Thing (1982)?
I watched it today for the first time and hated it.  Sorry!
It's basically the game "among us" lol
My uncle showed this to me when I was like 8 or 9 and I remember not being able to close my eyes without seeing those “things.” It scarred me for life lol
I watched The Thing a couple days ago. It’s a halloween season must watch. John carpenter put out Halloween 1,2&3, the Thing, the Fog, Christine, all in a 5 year period. He’s fantastic. I re-watch John carpenter movies every fall!
I watched this movie with my suite mate in college. It was my first Halloween in the states, had the best time SUCH a good movie. Worth every second. 

Also, thank u having me over and kinda ruin ur date night, R.
I saw the first rendition of “The Thing” in the 50s and I still remember the fear it produced and I’m 75!
Yes, this movie remains awesome! I am happy that they made a prequel as well (rather than a remake, because they would never be able to top this). It makes for an awesome evening of fun!
Quality flick!
Thank you.
One of my favorite movies
I just watched 'It Follows' and it was fucking amazing. I heard it was influenced by this film. 

Any other recommendations of movies similar to that?
This is exactly what I watched last night for Halloween! One of my all time favorite films, great eerie atmosphere, isolated location, great acting, great effects, haunting soundtrack. Love it.
We watched the original Halloween.
creepy as shit, watched it again, first time since i was a kid in the theater when it came out...
I watched this last night. I   found it kinda slow
It's my favorite movie. So good.
Ever since I first watched this spectacular film, I have said that this is the perfect horror film. It is also a bone chilling thriller, a claustrophobic science fiction flick and a disturbing whodunnit mystery. In fact I once showed it to a girl on a date who didn’t like horror films and she said she liked it for the express purpose of trying to figure out who was the bad guy every ten minutes. On top of that you have the phenomenal score of the master Ennio Morricone which ties it all together. This film is perfect.
It is overall a good movie but does get boring at some parts.
I never even considered it but took suggestion from this group and LOVED it and about half way thru was  laughing so hard every time it upped the level of gore!!
That Live, was ahead of its time. Hollywood should reboot this one in 3D! It will never be the same as Director Carpenters original.  He is the Depeche Mode of cinema!!!
I'm not a fan of horror, but I feel like watching The Thing helped me prepare for the body horror in Alien. Great movie!
I’ve seen both versions several times
Lol.   These movies from the 80s never hold up.

Meh... I can’t get myself something to watch I know I’m going to be bored with in 30 minutes
I thought “hey I should suggest John carpenters: the thing”

 I check top all time to see what other people Recommend 







Fuck
My great uncle, Richard Dysart, was the doctor who got his hands cut off by the monster growing inside of one of the workers when he did the autopsy. Great scene btw. The head comes off and sprouts legs and crawls away.
i heard theres a lot of subliminal symbolism in the movie can anyone explain? or should i just watch it. also is it on netfli
To close to reality from the last 10 years of my life, at the moment.  I'll give it another watch when I have less toxic trolling family members in my life.
The movie was critically panned when it came out for 3 reasons 

ET came out around the same time and everyone was loved the idea of a friendly alien

The movie can be interpreted as about AIDS , and in 1984 the American people wouldn't come to terms with the epidemic until Philidelphia come out a couple years later. 

The characters had very little personality. This isn't due to poor writing but mostly due to how these guys have known each other for months and having Mcready say "When I was a little boy in Washington state my father was neglecting so I know have a dear hatred for all things not nice" or some other bullshit right before he flame thrtows the thing. It is also done to make the characters more realistic as the big differance between real life situations and movies is that movies are planned scripts that are able to be more clever. The cast of the Thing are in the moment and don't have time for dramatics. This maskes the characters more vulnerable and the audience more unsure.

But now it can be fully appreciated.
I thought The Thing was shit.
Yo
I was about to watch this with roommates but saw on Doesthedogdie.com that multiple dogs are killed in this.  So I’ll have to wait until I can watch it by myself, but I’m kind of shocked not a single SOUL thought to mention that on here before sending people out to watch this.  Some people are very sensitive to animal deaths.  Should always be mentioned.
You just made me waste my time. It’s not the big thing.
Kurt Russel version!  Absolutely!
My favorite horror movie of all time. And 3rd favorite movie ever. Fucking timeless masterpiece.

I just saw it for the first time and it sent me on a huge John Carpenter kick. I then watched the rest of his “apocalypse trilogy.” Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness are fucking amazing. I also really enjoyed They Live, but it’s not horror. Christine was pretty good, since I’m also a huge Stephen King fan. 

I actually enjoyed the 2011 The Thing which is a prequel. I watched it back to back for the first time with the original so it was cool seeing the setup.
Really?? Why? I watched it and it was a pretty average monster film.

Ppl tend to overrate Carpenter. Assault on Precinct 13 wasn’t that good but is regarded as a classic. Same with Halloween. Not sure why. Maybe because he works on small budgets and critics tend to value that, dunno

A complete stranger offers you $1,000,000 if you can recommend them 3 movies they haven't seen before and they end up rating at least one of them a 5/5.
You know nothing about their background, personal taste or viewing history. You can only make 3 recommendations. You only get the money if the stranger has seen *none* of the 3 movies you suggest previously *and* they rate 1 or more of them a 5/5 after watching. Go!

Stalker by Tarkovsky Solaris might be a safer bet as it's a bit less ambiguous and poetic (only a little) but Stalker is so mesmerising and its use of cinematography and music is enough to make someone feel it's a 10/10 just on atmosphere alone even if they don't have a scooby doo what's going on. Where as Solaris is easier to follow and less meditative it's still got a slow pace that can put people off. 

Perfect Blue it's anime as fuck but at the same time feels like a David Fincher thriller till the lines start getting really blurred and then we are into Nolan territory. Both have works that many people would rate 10/10 and both have probably been inspired in some way by the works of Satoshi Kon wether they know it or not! Also in this day and age with the obsession of celebrity culture, Instagramers, tick tock clockers and all that jazz it's more relevant than ever.

Timecrimes is a Spanish horror/thriller with a bit of a time travel/time paradox twist hence the name. It's a very easy to watch and reveals its self at a decent pace and it becomes kinds obvious but not to obvious where it is going. It came out around the same time as Rec and a few other Spanish horror type films hit it big but went under the radar... Or at least it feel that way most people I mention it to ain't seen or heard of it and have loved it when I make em go watch it.

Just realised I went with 3 non English language films so may have fucked my self but these are 3 films I love and I guess the subtitled nature means many people may not have bothered so hopefully you can force em to read or they are not bothered by dubbing.
**Muppet Treasure Island (1996)**

Bow down before me.
I was gonna say Ran, City of God, and The Third Man. Then I was going to say Amadeus but someone said that. But people picked those already. So I’m going

Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters - I don’t understand why this isn’t more well known. Fucking phenomenal from top to bottom but just  obscure enough that only film buffs and criterion nuts know if it’s existence.

Barry Lyndon - Stanley Kubrick’s hidden gem and what I believe to be his best work. It takes the cliched saying “every frame a painting” and makes it a fucking reality. Many people are put off by its lengthy runtime and the fact that it’s a period piece but it’s much more than that. superbly entertaining and surprisingly hilarious it’s 3 hour runtime goes by like a breeze.

Harakiri - This is phenomenal. I don’t want to say anything about it. If you haven’t seen it, watch it. Not only is it one of the greatest samurai movies of all time, but one of the greatest movies of all time period
- The secret in their eyes (2009)
- 28 days later (2002)
- The lives of others (2006)
Trust (1990)

Naked (1993)

The Handmaiden (2016)
Ok, let's game this system! If I can find one (1) obscure enough masterpiece, in theory I still get my payday if I suggest two (2) awful garbage films that no one has seen because why would they? All the same, my chances of payday are increased with three (3) somewhat obscure films. Hmmmmmm (Originally, there was a link to a video clip from The Dark Crystal here, those who've seen it know which, but the Automod didn't like it, so I'm stuck having to explain my bad joke, and thereby make it worse)...

Ok, here's what I have. For option one:

• Wolfwalkers - The masterpiece, released on a streaming service that has almost nothing of interest, animated so not of interest to most adults and from an animation studio that doesn't have the following of Disney or Pixar or Dreamworks or Ghibli or other studios of the like. It is breathtaking, beautiful and one of the most wonderful films I've ever seen, and it deserves more love, it was an easy 5/5 for me.

• Jack and Jill - Why?

• Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas - No really, **why?**

For option two, featuring three masterworks and not trying to game the system:

• The Straight Story - Yes, those opening credits say "Walt Disney presents a David Lynch film." No, you're not on shrooms. David Lynch's most straightforward film, and his most underrated, tells the true story of a man who took a riding mower to visit his dying brother. It's heartfelt, poignant, sweet and wholesome, which is surprising from the man who gave us Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, but it's also an excellent film with a simple story haunted by some very powerful emotion.

• JSA - One of Park Chan Wook's first films initially seems to be a simple murder mystery set in the DMZ between North and South Korea, but as it unfolds, reveals itself to be something much less straightforward and conventional and explores the complex relationship between the two nations and throws in some stunning cinematography to boot.

• Logan Lucky - I feel like this Steven Soderbergh heist film snuck in under the radar and didn't get the attention it deserved, which is a right shame because it is an absolute blast. It's funny, clever and features a bunch of really skilled actors clearly having a great time. And it feels like it's having a good time with its West Virginia setting, but not talking down to it. It's hard to come away from this one without a smile on your face.

It's got a little bit of something for everyone, and it's sufficiently obscure that some random person is more likely than not to have *not* seen it, **and** its subject/style are unlikely to be replicated any time soon.
People are ignoring the "haven't seen this before part", which I think can be pretty well covered by just focusing on older movies with niche styles. I think that picking top tier niche movies will increase my "haven't seen it" chances more than enough to offset the chances of someone outright hating the niche.

Akira - I can't imagine that the majority of people watch anime at all, and even plenty of people who do often overlook older movies.

The Dark Crystal - It's crazy how few people I've met who have seen this movie despite it being considered a masterpiece to a small crowd of fantasy nerds and muppet lovers.

Ran - a grand film that most people will not have seen just because they don't bother with old or foreign  films.

Gonna recommend 3 tamil movies which though is critically acclaimed here in India might actually be not as well known worldwide. 

Jigarthanda :-A dark comedy based on a gangster and a filmmaker who decides to flim his life story without his knowledge,He gets caught and things escalate from there. 

Super deluxe:-Hyperlink cinema by one of the most elusive but celebrated directors in India. An incredible dark comedy that shows the lives of the downtrodden in a tale of woe,despair and euphoria. 

Anbe sivam:- another incredible piece of flimmaking which speaks about religion and it's various intrepretation. Chances are high that it could change your outlook on life.
[Pather Panchali 1955](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pather_panchali)

[Ankho Dekhi 2013](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ankhon_dekhi)

[Hazaaro Khwahishein Aisi 2003](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hazaaron_khwaishein_aisi)

Since you haven't said anything about the language of the movie, hence recommending some of the finest Bollywood and Bengali flicks, hoping that you are not Indian and haven't watched these movies. 

If you want more recommendations for some great films of bollywood, hit me up on PM.
Kwaidan (1964): horror anthology film based on various Japanese ghost stories with incredible set pieces. Haunting and atmospheric period piece that I think would work for people who otherwise don’t like horror. 

The Saddest Music in the World (2003): there’s no other film like it. It looks like a dream taken directly out of someone’s brain. Plus it’s funny.

Come and See (1985): one of the most brutal and gripping war films ever made. It’s a movie I think everyone should see at least once.
Wild Strawberries

Run Lola Run

Legend of the Mountain
Castaway on the Moon    
The Legend of Billie Jean
Mary & Max
Hmmm...

Solaris (1972)
Eat Drink Man Woman (1994)
Moonlight(2016)

I wanted to keep the films as varied as possible while retaining qualities that to me, would make them a 5 to *someone.* 

While Moonlight might actually have been seen by the stranger due to how recent it was, but I find it unlikely.

Had this introduced to me as 'three hours of piss, shit and blood' at a festival screening. Man, it's a tough watch, but it stayed with me. I'll watch it again one day, when I'm ready for it.

Hunter's Blood (1986)

Made for TV Deliverance / Southern Comfort clone, starring Clu Gulager. Grimy, nasty and brutal, and just a great Friday night drinking film.

Resolution (2012)

Not a perfect film, but a complete experience. The tone and feel is just right: claustrophobic and fragile. To the point where I had a full on panic attack in the cinema. Not due to jump-scares - it's not that kind of film. There's something existential that it taps into, for me.

I love this prompt even though it’s nearly a month old, I wanted to try my best.

Hoop Dreams (1994) dir. Steve James: I’ve never loaned a movie to friends as much as Hoop Dreams and it’s always returned with rave reviews. The general public is much better acquainted with the language of documentaries and the three hour run time won’t frighten anybody in this era where blockbusters reach that regularly. This is a popular but not too popular flick and is up there in a group with Parasite, Princess Bride, Casablanca, Toy Story, and Jackie Chan’s bloopers in being universally beloved. It has around 25,000 IMDB reviews and made a pretty big splash in the mid 90s so it’s the riskiest of my picks.

An Angel at My Table (1990) dir. Jane Campion: Fewer than 7,000 reviews on IMDB that feels very modern 30 years later. The handling of mental health will remind many of the Queen’s Gambit. 

The Daytrippers (1996) dir. Greg Mottola: Fewer than 5000 IMDB reviews from the director of Superbad featuring a ton of recognizable actors being funny and charismatic. It has that perfect balance of goofiness and grounded emotions.

Other films considered: Klute, Late Spring, Touki Bouki, Close-Up, Wet Hot American Summer, Born in Flames, Army of Shadows, Gertrud, Babette’s Feast, The Night of the Hunter, In The Mood For Love, Caché, Au Revoir les Efantes, Beau travail, Mirror, and You, The Living

So that’s one of the best under the radar sci-fi/thriller movies of the century so far, an astoundingly well filmed great drama, and the movie Homeland ripped it’s 1st season plot from but wayyyy better (incl a secret hidden plot twist they don’t tell you about, but if you do pick up on it entire scenes take on different meanings and it’s a great watch both times).
I have started to move into reality tv because it seems like i have seen everything 🥸😫.   This could be a interesting game show like win ben steins money but i am the Ben guy.

What we do in the shadows
The Apartment (1960) - My favorite romance comedy of all time. Most people don't watch B&W films or anything from the 1960s. It is one of the most well written films of all time. 

Apocalypse Now (1979) - It's an overlooked film that most film aficionados have watched it but the casual fan hasn't.

Le Samourai (1967) - It's a crime film classic. It's foreign and from the sixties. It is the predecessor of the "no talk, all action" professional criminal film, such as The Driver, Thief and Drive.
Chungking express (wong kar wai)

Probably not obscure enough but most people I talk to - that aren’t avid movie fans - don’t know them.
Lightyears is an animated film from maybe 1984 that is excellent. On mushrooms. Microwave Massacre (1982) is a poignant reflection of a young boys face in a cellophane wrapped VHS movie that he was never allowed to watch yet was immensely intrigued by, and then idk maybe Begotten because it’s just a good ol’ popcorn and soda ride to enjoy with the grandkids.
Wizards, little Nemo, color of magic
Tampopo (1985) - a ‘ramen Western!’ An offbeat Japanese comedy movie about food. The main storyline follows a struggling noodle shop, but this is intersected with a series of funny and delightful situational subplots. 

Frequencies (2013) - a thought-provoking independent British science fiction movie. Explores complex and profound philosophical ideas centred around a love story. 

The Elementary School (1991) - a heartwarming Czech comedy about an unruly village class and their new alleged-war hero teacher. 

Pretty chuffed with the answers I came up with; already imagining what I’m gonna spend this sweet money on.
Best bet is to offer 3 different types of movies. I present a myster/thriller, a family drama sports flick, and an organized crime action film. 

Gone Baby Gone

Warrior

The Raid 2
Zodiac (2007)

Blade Runner 2049 (2017)

No Country For Old Men (2007)
So, apparently most people are risking it a lot with the "haven't seen any of the three", most of these answers would lose if I was the person, so I'll try to go deep and diverse, I'll also avoid super popular movies in a certain country and I'll try to go old and hard to find. I'll go to Letterboxd and pick the three lesser known movies among the ones I rated 5 stars, one or two per country.

\- Under the Flag of the Rising Sun (1972), 4 star average on Letterboxd (quite high) and has been rated only **394 times** on Letterboxd.

\-  Minbo: the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion (1992), 3.8 star average on Letterboxd, has been rated only **585 times** on Letterboxd. 

\- War and Peace (1966), 4.2 average star rating on Letterboxd, by far my biggest risk, has been ted a bit over **2,500 times,** this is the biggest chance to get a 5 star rating, it's a massive epic almost impossibly big, has the biggest battle scene ever filmed, and just entered Letterboxd's top 250, 8.2 in IMDB too.

Unless the random person is Russian and old enough to see it in its initial run, I think I'm more than safe.

Good fellas, pulp fiction, Pirates of the Caribbean: curse of the black pearl
I tried to pick three different films that would appeal to vastly different audiences.

City Lights (1931)

Seven Samurai (1954)

Spirited Away (2001)
In Harms Way
Failsafe
The Day the Earth Stood Still
The Big Blue, True Romance and the original Stephen King The Stand
Le Trou (1960) 

The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner (1974)

Vengeance is Mine (1979)
It's Such A Beautiful Day (2012)
(More of an experience than a movie gotdamn)

The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
(and hope they haven't seen it yet)

Clerks (1994)
(Personally haven't seen many comedies that make me laugh like this movie)
Watch Men in Black, 3 times in a row and i'll collect my 3 million dollars
Run Lola run, Trolls 2 annnnnnnd Fear of a black hat
I want to play the opposite game with three films that people will give a 0/5 not because they are bad but because people hate what they are seeing.
1. A Serbian Film 2. Salo, or the 120 days of Sodom 3. Cannibal Holocaust
Carlito’s Way

12 Monkeys

The Way to Fight(Japan)
1- A Fistful of Fingers

It never got an official home video release, so it's very hard to find. Many haven't heard of it.

2- Killer Klowns from Outer Space

I figure a lot of people haven't watched this movie, unless they're a fan of cult classics.

3- Re-Animator

Another cult classic horror film. This one I think could be the 5/5.

Honourable Mention- Bad Taste

Peter Jackson's first film, not super well-known since most people know him for making the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films. (And maybe his King Kong movie) But probably not a 5/5.
Being There
Bill 5/5

I Am Sam 5/5

Casino

Eyes Wide Shut

Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas
The Army of Shadows (1969), Rear Window (1954), and Midnight in Paris (2011)
People tend to forget horror movies so I would suggest: Cadaver , Silent Hill  AAANND... white chicks.
Before the devil knows you’re dead - great under seen thriller
Ronin - again. 
Arrival - again
Blue Ruin (2013)

Burning (2018)

Willow (1988)
Vampire Hunter D

Aaah! Zombies!!!

Slumdog Millionaire

Edit: want to replace one of these with Malice in Wonderland and can’t decide so just using this as an excuse to post a 4th movie.
Aight good question, good answers. Imma save this thread.
Maudie

The Hill

Harry and Tonto
I will cheat and say Dune (2021) since it hasn't come out yet
[removed]
The Tale of Princess Kaguya

La Haine

Sing Street


If they are quite new to film then I’d also say Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, cuz otherwise it’s likely that the person has already seen it.
The Invisible Guest.
Khosla Ka Ghosla!
Parasite.

Parasite would be widely known in the international cinema, but Khosla Ka Ghosla is not watched by many. The Invisible Guest's remake in Hindi is Badla. Badla is finely remade without many big changes.

Even watching n number of times, there are very few movie which do not bore the viewer.

Parasite is on PrimeVideo
The Invisible Guest and Badla is on NF
Khosla Ka Ghosla is on the Internet, need to search a bit.

I am sure the viewer will rate at least two from three 5/5.
The Zero Effect 

Fresh

City of Lost Children
Throne of Blood

Alright, alright, alright. Here we go.


First off, Long Day's Journey Into Night (2019).

Secondly, Being There (1979). 

Lastly, Hell or High Water (2016).
Very good game 
I would suggest 
The Spy of mellisa McCarthy 
Flipped
Handsome Devil 

I know most of them are pretty simple like not sci fi and all which most of the ppl have recommended but from my taste I love movies like this and I don’t even watch many movies but all 3 of this have helped me
Wolfwalkers - Cartoon Saloons masterpiece and hard to view

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya - Isao Takahata's underviewed Ghibli masterpiece. 

It's such a beautiful day - Don Hertzfeldt, only available through purchase

Runners up: 
City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Apartment, Amelie, My Life As A Zucchini, Killer of Sheep, Triplets of Belleville, Mindgame (or The Night is Young Girl, Walk On), City of God, Pleasantville, Woman in the Dunes, Ikiru, Boy

2 of them are popular Indian movies, but rarely anyone outside Indians watches Indian movies so it's unlikely they've been seen by one.
12 Angry Men
Bicycle Thieves
Oldboy
Surely the correct strategy is to pick two totally obscure movies they have virtually no chance of seeing and one movie that is amazing that they probably haven’t seen?
One Cut of the Dead. El secreto de sus ojos (The secret in their eyes). Lu over the wall.

American Animals (2018) never heard anyone talk about this movie before. I saw it a few months ago and thought it was very well done—probably the more well known of the three i am listing

11:14 (2003) basically an unheard of version of the movie Crash. First time I saw it, it totally sucked me in

The Killing Floor (2007) kinda like “The Exam” or “the Circle” the first time I watched this it totally blew my mind. A couple years later I watched it again and it didn’t have the same effect...but that first viewing has some shocks that have stuck with me to this day
The interview (1998)
Gangster No. 1 (2000)
The tailor of Panama (2001)
No Time To Die, Dune, Black Widow (see what I did there)
[The Lady Vanishes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030341/) Alfred Hitchcock’s most charming film! But I only saw it when it was accidentally played at a film festival instead of The 39 Steps. I don’t think most people know about this film by the great master.

[Intacto](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220580/) Spanish film about luck vampires competing to see who’s the luckiest of them all. Both artsy and wildly entertaining at the same time!

[Exit Through The Gift Shop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587707/) One of the most entertaining and mind blowing movies I’ve ever seen, and it’s a documentary directed by Banksy. You’ll walk out not knowing what’s real anymore.

1) Shallow grave : Not a quite popular film but a really good one danny boyle mixing comedy and thriller like a boss
2) The basketball diaries : One of the best yet least known leo dicaprio movie 
3) Good time : Comes from a niche genre so very low chances he might’ve seen it tho it’s globally acclaimed

Based on the looks I get when I suggest those movies to friends, I bet there should not be much people that have seen them :

1. Himizu : a drama with lots of beautiful characters. Sion Sono... what can I say...

2. Super : absurd and hilarious movie

3. Nobody from nowhere (FR : un illustre inconnu). A thriller from France.

TIME LAPSE - another obscure movie, COHERENCE, had come out the year before so I was obsessed telling all my screenwriting friends about both movies. 

THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE - my favorite scary movie that nobody has seen, just in case they like horror.

I guess you wanna go with diversity and not blockbusters everyone has seen:

Ex Machina (Just a solid movie all around. Not the most famous movie ever. Hard to give it anything other than a 5)

Drive (Super well made, good music, fun)

Bone Tomahawk (Loads of people haven't seen it. Really good, and more in the thriller/horror genre)

Ideally I get a nice Thai lady that won't have seen many movies and is too nice to give anything other than a 5 for all of them.

The Lunchbox, Your Name and Schindler’s List 
Yes, I know Schindler’s List is a very popular movie, but it’s also long and sad and black and white so I think it would surprise you how many people haven’t actually ever watched it, but it’s honestly a fantastic movie even if you’re not a big movie nerd.
I haven't seen as many movies as I would like or as some of you guys here so I'd go with movies I rated 10/10 but not for personal reason. Once I narrowed down my list, I went with movies that I'm fairly confident the average human hasn't seen, rather than find some movies who are lesser known even in this sub.

I'm fairly confident the average person hasn't even heard of Seven Samurai much less seen it. Some who might have heard about it but didn't watch it have been put off by the fact that it's in Japanese, because it's in black and white (although if you ask me that's the most ridiculous reason to not watch a movie), and because it's from the 50s. 

For my second pick I would go for Nosferatu (1922). Again because, unless you are film buff or a Dracula buff, you wouldn't have heard about this movie. Once again, it's in black and white with the added bonus of not having a great picture quality which would detract the most adventurous casuals. It's also in German. The main reason though: it's from the 1920s and silent, you have to be really dedicated or curious to go see it.

Lastly, I would go with Casablanca. Sure, it's one of the most critically aclaimed movies of all time but it's from the 40s, the vast majority of people in 2021 haven't seen it. The thing that differenciates it from my two previous choices is that it's basically a guaranteed 10/10. It's not long like Seven Samurai, it doesn't have a weird green/blue tinge to it like Nosferatu, and, unlike these two, it's not in a foreign language. 

Now, I hope that millionaire isn't someone who likes to talk about movies on reddit.

Minari (2020) - is still very much possible that the stranger doesn't saw this film because it's not available in every streaming services or cinemas.

Who Am I (2014) - is German, highly possible that the stranger doesn't saw this too

The Body (2012) - is Spanish, also highly possible that the stranger doesn't saw this.

Assuming the stranger asked us in English, has  English accents and is native speaker, then it's very much possible that he doesn't saw many foreign language films.

The absolute most terrifying movie you’ve ever seen.
Let me have it. I want to shit my pants in a fetal position as I meekly weep for my mother, slowly rocking back and forth until the sun comes up.

You heard me.
The most horrifying thing I’ve seen is not a movie. It’s from the XFiles. The episode is called Home. It’s been shown twice on tv and has never been part of their reruns. Good luck with this one. I will never watch it again.
SPOORLOOS (aka THE VANISHING) (1988)

Go into it blind. Do not read anything about it. I did that and it really freaked me out and stuck with me for a long time.
Martyrs (2008). The French one, not the remake. Enjoy!
I wasn't personally scared by this film but my friend said that The Thing from 82 really scared her due to the practical effects and how real they looked.
I'll defend Hereditary till the day I die. When THAT scene came there was an audible gasp in the cinema. The movie did not go anywhere expected and it was truly a ride. 

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did not give me one second to exhale. It was all too much.
I love horror movies, but nothing got in my head quite like a ten minute youtube documentary on the Nutty Putty caving incident.
Antichrist 

Fucking worst scene in the barn. Stayed with me for months.
The Exorcist hands down- I can’t believe they made that in the early/mid 70s. It was absolutely terrifying. Also? The original Salem’s Lot miniseries scared the shit out of me so that I don’t want to sleep near a window
The Night House got me pretty good recently.
Funny Games

Eden Lake

Audition
A relatively recent one that had me feeling uneasy almost the entire time was Caveat.
The Exorcist and Hereditary
try Host (2020)
Poltergeist, never looked at trees the same since.
Compliance. Absolutely disturbing. Surprised no one had mentioned it.
The Descent. Spelunking is terrifying
Jesus Camp
Audition

Tusk 

Martyrs
Fire in the Sky
In the Mouth of Madness terrorized me as a kid. Been years but I remember it sticking with me.
Threads (1984)
Not even horror but the diner scene in Mulholland Drive gave me the most anxiety out of any film I've watched.
we need to talk about kevin.
hell house LLC
Taking a different approach, but Requiem for a Dream! I never want to watch it again
The Ritual and VVitch, lights off, no phone
I’ll always suggest Sinister, the music is very well done in the creepiest way possible and the sheer shock factor will hang with you for a while
Event Horizon
The Kill List maybe isn’t terrifying but made me very anxious and uneasy, and has an ending that stuck with me for a long time.
I think it all depends on what type of horror scares you, but my money is on *The Strangers*.
The Fourth Kind
The Amityville Horror but that’s a dated movie now and won’t have the same impact it did 40+ years ago.
Probably Lake Mungo.

But that's me, I like a good slow burn in a format that kind of looks like it might've came from youtube documentaries. If that's not your style, the next one that scared the holy hell out of me was Aterrados and it really isn't a slow burn.
Someone already said it, but “Event Horizon” scared the shit out of me. Fuck that movie.
August underground
Not me, but the last horror movie my mom has seen was The Excorcist back in the 70's. She hasn't seen a horror movie since then.
Begotten (1989).
The autopsy of Jane Doe.
Dear Zachary

It's a documentary.

It will horrify you and tear you apart.
Dark Skies, I can’t sleep for days every time I watch this.
Exorcist 1 & 3. 

Rosemary's Baby - visually... not as much, concept, absolutely. 

The nightingale. Not technically horror. But truly horrific, amazing thriller.

His house was quite good too.
How have I not seen a reference to Jaws? It traumatized a generation. The music alone terrified us.
Threads (1984) 

The Road (2009)

Absolute bleakness with zero hope of humanity

Salo or 120 Days of Sodom is also a good one

You want to fucking bawl your eyes out though? Dear Zachary (2008). Holy fucking shit
Green Room?
Paper House.
Unpopular opinion, but The Firm. That movie is terrifying
Fresh is fucked up.
Don’t Look Now
The Mist, i was like 11 when i watched this movie, i could not sleep for like a whole week.
Hush. Creep.
Exorcism of Emily, terrified me. I took the DVD outside and they it away
Hmm.. 
For me. Gaslight 1944
I’ll throw in The House That Jack Built.  It lingers. 
I’ve also heard the original possession film is a doozy but I’ve never got my hands on it
The Blair witch project.
The majority of the terror stems from who you are and where you are in life. I.e. I found ‘Funny games’ enthralling, an impotent upperclass person would probably find it repulsive. I suggest finding your phobia and starting there.

The Exorcist
The Ring
Cure (1997) directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa
Speak no evil.
late to this but Pulse by Kurosawa has some of the scariest moments i’ve ever seen in a horror film.
The Taking of Deborah Logan lives on as one of the scariest movies I've seen recently, if not the scariest.
The american remake of Ring will always be my scariest film. Next to Hereditary
Funny no one has mentioned The Ring...
Local evening news.
So is this just a daily request now?
Its not a monster or slasher flick! But the one movie that has always terrified me was the Sandra Bullock movie The Net! Because the subject of the movie is even if slightly possible!
Mama (2013)
Trilogy of Terror: the 3rd short story where Karen Black gets tormented by a reanimated voodoo warrior doll. 1970’s gritty film and much more creepier than today’s CG effects. Don’t watch it with your kids, they will be traumatized.
[deleted]
The Entity (1982) and The Exorcist. Demons on steroids scare the crap out of me.
Silence of the Lambs
I haven't had that experience per say but most recently The Strangers and It Follows strike a really precise combo of fear and paranoia in their own ways that I haven't felt before tbh. Those are my two picks at the moment.
Annihilation

Eraserhead

Hereditary
Come and see (1985, Russian)

It’s a different kind of scary. Truth scary.
I’ll always recommend Suspiria (2018). This was really scary partly because I had no idea what was going on, so it was impossible to anticipate what would happen next.
There have been a lot of good ones in spread out the last few decades.

- The Exorcist (the re-released version with the spider walk)

- It Follows

- The Descent

- Hereditary 

- The Blair Witch Project (only if you saw it on opening night, before anyone told you what it was about, and before absolutely knowing it was fake, and before subsequent copy-cat movies)
I am not sure if it's as terrifying as you want, but you will feel very disturbed and unsettled by Midsommar.
Poltergeist was good back in the day. There are very few movies that stand the test of time, John Carpenter’s The Thing really does, and Lifeforce did a decent job considering it’s from 1985.
The Medium (2021)

You can thank me later or curse at me if you’d like 😂
The Dark and the Wicked
Rec (2007)
Maybe I'm alone in this but...
Dead Silence (2007) especially if you don't like dolls.

I also can't deny the first Sinister movie. Not saying the second isn't good but for scare factor the first holds much more suspence. 
I'm a horror nut but for supernatural and phycological horror.  Not sifi. Ghosts and crazy people. 
That's why my 3 favorite horror franchises are 

The conjuring series (lumping in The Nun)
Sinister series
And insidious series. 

Mama is also pretty good. I like suspense.
Disappointed to not see 13 Ghosts at least mentioned
Recently watched Fall (2022). It's about 2 girls that climb on top of a 2000 feet tower. It's not scary as in horror movie catscares scary, but I'm afraid of heights. They really exploited that fear in the movie with camera angles and I can honestly say there isn't a single other movie that made me feel so uncomfortable.
[REC] or The Descent
Do documentaries count?
The act of killing (2012)
"The Autopsy of Jane doe "was sooooo scray, we were just holding each other with my gf, right until the end
What a creepy movie that is
Htf no one mentioned Insidious series… most terrifying thing is in those movies that had a spinoff
My buddy was just asked this by his high school students. Now it’s a big joke because he sincerely answered “Wall-E.” But to be fair, it was added “That entire movie terrifies me because of how accurate it could be.”
Nothing scared me as an adult more than paranormal activity…. But the best horror movie is the shining.
Alice sweet Alice -1976

My parents would try to hide this movie from me and my sister when we were kids. Of course we snuck our way into watching it multiple times. It stuck with me forever. I recently rewatched it with my wife, and it was still just as disturbing as I remember if not more now that I’m an adult.
It’s a must!
I'm not too good with horror movies so this may not be a very valid comment but, watched The Evil Dead from 2013 at the movie theater with a bunch of friends and got scared so badly I swore to never watch a horror movie ever again. Great movie from a critical point of view, but I'm never going to watch it again for sure
The Day After. 1983. 

I saw it when I was a child. It haunted me and everyone I know for years. Mainly because it touches on a realistic danger.
The V/H/S movies are pretty freaky. I dislike most found footage movies, but those are decently horrifying.
I know a lot of people will probably disagree, but for me Oculus stayed with me for a bit.
Shh  
Why did I google all these movies you wrote here
Hereditary is the only movie to actually scare me. I’ve been stressed, I’ve been spooked, but only Hereditary made me genuinely scared.
I’m probably desensitized a bit but to this day I still think The Descent is the best underrated horror film.
I’m sure this going to be tame for most of you but dawn of the dead (the 2004 remake) absolutely terrified me! I already have an irrational fear of zombies or the idea of them… see them full on sprint… yep, terrified. Went to sleep on the couch at a friend’s place for 2 weeks after seeing it in cinema
Martyrs (the original French version) is the only movie I have never been able to bring myself to rewatch.
The remake of Suspiria.
The Shining- 1980.
The Conjuring
The Babadook

A single parent dealing with a troubled child and a horrifying monster in the basement, with no options.  The subtext of real life people trapped in tragic situations just made my nerves raw.
I’ve always loved scary movies and scary rides and generally feel like a pretty analytically minded, sane person. 

But Quiet Place 2 really fucked with me - especially the first ten minutes. I’m a mom and the thought of having a nice, normal day go so godawful sideways and horrific… I just can’t. I could never watch it again. I wanted to leave the theater, pack up my kids, and go hide in the woods to prep for aliens. I laid awake at night googling alien shit. 

But, like somebody else said, sometimes it’s about where you’re at in your life. Not sure that movie would’ve hit the same pre-kids years ago.
Midsommar - bro by the end of this movie I was in a state of terrified confusion. It was so freaky but also very melancholy. To this day my brain is consistently fascinated and wants to understand- but I just cannot sit thru all that gore and torture again
Soooo this might be an odd choice.

But I'm gonna go with Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho".

There's something about the buildup that's genuinely disturbing. Gore and jump scares are just gimmicky and aren't something I consider terrifying. They're fun for an adrenaline spike when you're a teenager, after that it's just kind of lame. Tense situations with enough time to mess with your mind and make things seem worse are far more terrifying. And Hitchcock was brilliant at crafting that kind of intensity.
The Wailing
The Hills Have Eyes. Couldn’t even finish it.
Hereditary. In my opinion it’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen. Just 120 minutes of constant unease.
28 Days Later & 28 Weeks Later

28 Days Later is a brutal lo-fi mostly "found footage" horror movie shot on low res DV. 28 Weeks Later is the sequel that takes the same concept but shot and edited more like a traditional movie.

Both movies are super scary and good.
Mulholland Drive. Strangely, it's not the monster in the back of the diner that got me, but the preceding close up of the nervous man , and the way he talks and looks. IT was so visceral.

I don't watch horrifying Horrormovies, because I think they're mostly just disgusting and unnecessary. But Lynch's horror has purpose. It' s harrowing.
The Exorcist
Grandma, you c**k sucker
The Forest of Love

Not terrifying...more gory and mentally disturbing but worth a mention.  Japanese flick on Netflix somewhere around 2.5 hours.  Sion Sono is a madman director.
Martyrs. French version.

High tension
Earthlings will do that for you
The Decent
 Night of the Living Dead
Insidous
cant think of the worst, but antichrist fucked me up as a kid
The Ring, invasion of the body snatchers 70s version
The thing

Requiem for a dream

Midsommer

Oldboy

Irreversible
never let me go
The Thing (1982) - the costumes & effects are at an another level.
**Tied for the the most terrifying.**

The Exorcist

Alien

The Thing

**Honorable mention**

The Descent.
The house that jack built,
A Serbian movie (sickest movie I’ve watched. Wouldn’t recommend)
The Sadness, 
Sinister, 
Grave Encounters,  
The taking of Deborah Logan,  
Rosemarys Baby, 
Eden Lake
Saw 1
'The fourth kind' freaked me out. Will also recommend 'Sinister' - I had to watch that movie in 2 parts.
Ringu - the Japanese original. 

and somehow Blair Witch Project (but it only works on a big screen)
The Ring
Thanatomorphose
Not sure any horror movie has ever done that but "Mama" was pretty creepy
Although Sinister has recently been selected as the scariest movie by a scientific study, I really did shit my pants with the Hereditary.
Shutter. The Thai version.
The Ring! Scary and creepy as hell!
Ringu (1998)

i haven't seen the american remake
August Underground
Who framed Roger rabbit still gives me nightmares thirty years later.

(May not work as an adult haha)
REC
The ring
Ju-on that got me as an adult
If you want something that is truly fucked up watch some japanese horror movies
the wailing, it’s a slow burn but it’s the only horror movie that’s truly gotten under my skin in years
The bear scene from Annihilation is legitimately the only time I’ve ever been horrified and felt terror on a very deep primal level watching a movie.
Would you rather
Hereditary, Exorcist, Drag Me to Hell
The Twilight Zone Movie.  That dude on the airplane wing haunted my childhood.  I still think about it every time I get on an airplane.
the exorcist, nothing comes close. The Ring is also just creepy af still.
The Strangers
Most of mine are alien abduction films. They scare the hell out of me. Maybe I was abducted and probed? here it goes from scariest to least:

The Fourth Kind (2009) Fire In The Sky (1993) Communion (1989)
The Night House
Lots of mainstream suggestions here, but as a horror fanatic who watches at least one horror movie a day, [Terrified](https://letterboxd.com/film/terrified-2017/) (not Terrifier) is the only movie that has given me nightmares in decades. It's so unpredictable. It's EVERY kind of horror.
Drag Me to Hell was very scary! The sense of dread and nothing you can do to stop this thing was palpable!
Fatal Attraction.  Not horror, but I have been scared of Glenn Close ever since.
The Collector/Collection but it’s so horrifying. Watched this back in maybe…eighth grade during Spanish class since it was close to spring break so we decided to chill and watch Netflix…long story short I was clinging to my best friend the entire time and we ended up turning the movie off 😭😭
‚Midsommar‘ 

As I don‘t like horror I had to stop multiple times and still haven‘t finished it. I only want to watch it because of it‘s incredibly beautiful cinematography.
Requiem for a Dream
REQUIEM FOR A DREAM....Absolutely horrifying.
Ever seen HENRY: Portrait of a Serial Killer?
Following
Human Centipede
'Threads' a British movie from the 80's depicting the aftermath of nuclear war. It's  absolutely terrifying to me and I've seen pretty much every video nasty
Come and See, 
Gummo

not exactly pure horror but very horrific and unsettling.
As a kid growing up in the ‘70s , the Exorcist really scared me for years, even hearing the music Tubular Bells would give me chills. Now I can watch it with no scares
Threads and The Rapture
Threads is a good one
not exactly horror, but The Road scared the living shit out of me
Jacob's Ladder
Hostel because there is a 1000% chance that that is happening somewhere in the world as we speak
I recently watched the wailing, a korean horror movie. It wasn't terrifying to me but it was so good, western horror movies couldn't compare.
Possessor. It’s fairly recent but it’s a rare horror/psychological horror movie that I recommended to many friends and all of them said it didn’t disappoint, and these are my horror movie brothers who don’t find anything disturbing. More than any other movie, it really puts you into the shoes of the protagonist, and when things start spiraling it makes YOU feel as out of control and powerless as her. Even if you see where it’s going you feel such dread at what’s coming next, but you can’t look away. Fantastic effects and performances all around.
“Us” movie by Jordan Peele. I feel like people might disagree with me. But it scares me. The terrifying doppelgängers and the way they look, the music, the tethered, stolen lives and experiences. Just very scary and anxiety inducing
In Bruges (2008). Dark comedy at its finest.
Directed by Martin McDonagh and starring Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. The two protaginists are bad guys, one is deppressed and one is conflicted and it's really funny.

Edit: changed Domhnall to Brendan
One of my favorite movies
Rewatched this a few nights ago (for maybe the 6th time). Love it more and more every viewing; can't say I've seen anything else I could describe as "heartbreakingly hilarious". 

As crisp a film you could ask for.
This is the movie I watch whenever I forget what my kind of humor is. It grounds me.
Fuckin' Bruges.
Saw this and I was compelled to watch all of McDonagh’s films. I still think this is the best, although Three Billboards is pretty good too.
 [**Natalie**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077397/?ref_=tt_trv_qu): \[*Harry gets angry and is destroying the phone, his wife approach him, saying:*\] Harry. Harry! It's a inanimate fucking object!

[**Harry**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_trv_qu): \[*to wife*\] You're an inanimate fuckin' object!
Ayy.  Finally on hbo.  On my playlist.
Been to the top of the tower?
Fiennes is the star of the show imo, he always is though.
“Sorry about your cunt kids.” Say this to my parent friends all the time.
"Your a cunt, you've always been a cunt, and the only thing that's going to change is you're going to become an even bigger cunt."
And it's technically a christmas movie! For when you want to celebrate the holiday by just feeling really depressed.
There are a lot of alcoves in the Astridpark. You use this word, alcoves?
Bruges is a shithole
YOURE AN INANIMATE FUCKING OBJECT
Yeah, one of my fave films. Highly recommend Seven Psychopaths as well.
I feel immature, underdeveloped and dumb - I really did not the movie clever nor fun😭
Sure but Election (1999) is dark comedy at its finest.
War on Everyone also really good (same director I think). I cant believe it got shitty reviews. It’s hilarious
I spend a lot of time thinking about this movie just because...
And imposible to find anywhere here in Norway without a prescription
Thankfully, Domhnall Gleeson is not in the movie, I can't stand him.

It stars his father, Brendan Gleeson.
No doubt! One of my fav dark comedies
Martin McDonagh is a genius.
[removed]
I just watched this last night with the future wife.  I was surprised how much she appreciated it on a first watch. That's how I know she's the keeper.
Yer a bunch of fooking elephants.
You're an inanimate fucking object!
Great movie
Have you seen In Bruges u/SUNSfan ?
No shit.
If you dig this movie, I think you’ll love *Filth,* it’s a fantastic dark comedy that also makes you want to take a shower afterwards.
"It's an inanimate fockin' object!"

"**YOU'RE** AN INANIMATE FOCKIN' OBJECT!"
"Synderen have you watched in bruges?"
YOU'RE AN INANIMATE FUCKING OBJECT! 

is still my favorite insult
Thank you. Just finished watching this.. I feel glad for watching a nice dark comedy drama.. 
But, gotta see something else to lite the heart..
Watched it last week and I thought it was very funny
This is my favorite movie ever
I went and visited Bruges while in Belgium based on loving this movie and it’s beautiful setting.
I recently watched this one, as it had been on my list for a while. Man, it was a great dark humor/romcom...? Idk, but it was great!

I highly recommend it
Movie feels like a fever dream to me. It has such unique and dark tones that I’ve never seen before.
No love for Seven Psychopaths here?
Trailer -> https://youtu.be/qEJ0Ur1jo00
If you liked this movie check out:

Fargo - Cohen Brothers
The Lobster - Yorgos Lanthimos
Adaption - Spike Jonze
The Host - Bong Joon Ho

Just some that came to mind.
Fucking fantastic, shit had me laughing from “fucking shithole”
Love it. Easily one of my favorites
Perhaps my favourite film of all time. Harry Waters might just be the greatest character ever.
Can recommend highly 😬
Dope recommendation, just watched it and the ending was a work of art.
[removed]
He has a new movie coming out with Gleason and Farrell on Boxing Day and it looks like it’s going to be fantastic. Trailer already out. Oscar talk for Farrell who is such a talented actor but tends to pick shitty roles
This thread makes me look foreword to The Banshees of Inisherin.
I Love this Movie
What’s this on now?
This one is as good as Banshees of Insheernen is bad
[deleted]
I wanna watch a movie with a massive plot twist
Something that makes you go “holy shit” by the end. I remember watching a movie with my ex I don’t know what it was called but it was the biggest “holy shit what the fuck was that” of my life. I needed some moments to process what even happened. Any genre is welcome :)

Edit: god damn ive got enough movies for the rest of my life. Thanks y’all

Edit 2: still active ive watched 3 of the recommendations so far: shutter island, the prestige and oldboy. Thanks for the help reddit my mind was blown

Edit 3: watched fightclub. Amazing movie
The Prestige.
The Handmaiden (2016)
Identity with John Cusack and Ray liotta
Gone girl
Primal Fear.

Richard Gere, Edward Norton. 

Trust me. Jaw will drop.
The Others
Frailty
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of the OG twist in horror film. And its a classic.
Shutter Island(2010)
The original Saw has one of the great twists of all time.
Predestination
Most of these are just surprising plot twists with the movie's climax, then it's over. 
I would say a movie like Cabin in the Woods' twist actually changes the movie well before the end.
Old boy
The Sixth Sense
Arrival (2016)

Coherence

Fight Club
Identity
Memento
Arlington road

Se7en

The game

The prestige
Usual Suspects
No Way Out (1987)
Witness for the Prosecution
Sleepaway camp
Fractured
Prisoners
The game
The Sting
Sorry to Bother You. Gets crazy, and boy oh boy it never stops
Lucky Number Slevin
Orphan
Cabin in the Woods.  Awesome concept, the scale of the movie keeps getting bigger, great movie
It is weird to even recommend because I never want to know about a twist but...

Gone Girl fucked me up in the best way possible when I saw it for the first time
Incendies
The Village (2004) or damn near any Shyamalan film, except The Last Airbender. We don’t talk about that one
The Crying Game
Arrival
Babe. 

I heard it has a twist in the tail.....


Sorry. I'll get my coat.
The Sting
The mist
From Dusk till Dawn - the most insane plot twist out of nowhere. Please don't search what the movie is about before you watch it!
The Book of Eli
Shutter Island
No Way Out
No Way Out
Mr Brooks

Seven
The best plot twists are the ones you don't have any clue are coming.
One of the best is FightClub. 


Another good one is Shutter Island.


Empty Man is pretty good too.
I would say shutter island is one of the best because after watching you can re watch and since you know the end now it changes every single scene in the movie.  And makes it that much better.
The Game

1997, Michael Douglas thriller. I don't know if the twist at the end is massive you would call it but I thought it was really really good and I was totally surprised by it
The Talented Mr. Ripley
I went blind in to it and it goes in directions you'd never ever expect, I genuinely was gasping and speachless while just staring at my friend who already watched it
The invisible guest 2016. It’s a subtitled movie. I promise this twist will completely shock you.
Mr. Nobody
the OTHERS - nicole kidman
The lives of others. - foreign film
Source Code (2011)
Crazy Love

Dont look anything up about it, dont attempt any information about this rollercoaster mindfuck that is actually a documentary.
Hot Fuzz fits here, I think.
Parasite
Pandorum had me going WHAT THE FUUUUU when pretty boy dandy comes to play.
A limited series on Netflix called Behind Her Eyes

The Skeleton Key
Sixth Sense.  The guy with the hair piece was Bruce Willis the whole time.
You're probably seen them, but for me the movies that did that were:

Donnie Darko

The Sixth Sense
Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans

Werner Herzog with the full power of Nic Cage at his disposal? This movie fucks
i ***CANNOT*** recommend this movie enough! Last Night in SoHo. holy wow! one of my faves and my favorite plot twist EVER!!!
April fools day!
Identity, Memento, Usual Suspects, Triangle
i know a lot of people dont like this movie because of the differences from the book, but i never read the book

i thought the end of Ender's Game was crazy
Oldboy
The Prestige.
goodnight mommy
this is not a film rec but u shld watch a new apple tv original called "severance" pretty insane imp
One Cut of the Dead
Old Boy. The original Korean film.
Usual Suspects
The new Orphan movie threw me for a loop and a laugh but I wouldn’t call it that massive of a plot twist
The only real twist in Gone Girl is how the fuck David Fincher took 3 of the biggest doofus toolbag actors of all time (Affleck, Perry, & NPH) and got their best, most serious roles out of ALL THREE of them! Seriously, I feel like Fincher - knowing full well he was our greatest living director at the time - said to himself “Hmmm, I need a real challenge… I know, I’ll cast 3 of the most laughably disrespected actors in the biz and make a seriously dramatic thriller!”
Watch the original Old Boy
Uncut gems on Netflix starring Adam sandler
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels his a good one. 

Not sure if others would consider massive but it will catch you by surprise.  Great movie too.
The Game with Sean Penn and Michael Douglas. Great movie and great shocker at the end.
The Machinist
The Uninvited, under-rated movie
Orphan 2 has a major plot twist.
Kill List
Se7en

Shutter Island

Fight Club

Prisoners

Primal Fear

The Usual Suspects

The Sixth Sense

Unbreakable

Split

Get Out

The Prestige

Ex Machina

Memento

The Machinist
One Cut of the Dead.

Trust me, go in completely blind and sit through it all. The payoff is worth every second.
Martyrs (French)

The Vanishing (1983)
Nope.  It stars John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  Great twist.
Primal fear
Orphan, Triangle
Incendies
Society (1989)

The twist is the movie itself, the ending is just the cherry.
Shutter island
Shutter Island
The Prestige
Shawshank Redemption or Knives Out
If you can stomach this one, Old Boy.

So many twist and turns in this film. Near the end is the biggest and shocking twist ever, but I won’t spoil it for you.
Crying game
Doubt it, but if you don’t know the most quoted film line of all time, then I would add Empire Strikes Back
Old boy korean with subtitles
The Prestige and Shutter Island..
I feel like “Hereditary” is a good one for this
* Usual Suspects
* The Game
* Fight Club
* Inside Man
* Identity
* The Prestige
* The Village
* Seven 
* Primal Fear
Seven was quite a plot twist! Serial killer/seven deadly sins. Plot thickens, twists and turns. Not your average Brad Pitt film!
Want a real life twist that you’ll have a visceral reaction to? Check out the documentary Dear Zachary. It starts out as a love letter to a baby Zachary. It’s made by one of his fathers long time friends, and features that friend and others talking about Zachary’s murdered father and just trying to let Zachary know the father he’ll never meet through their stories. Then the story takes some pretty nuts twists that unfold into a true crime story as it’s happening.
I wanna watch a movie uninterrupted. 

Plot twist: I can’t. I have kids.
Premonition or preminition I don’t feel like googling how to spell it right now
Seven
Arlington road I think it’s called
The Invisible Guest
the identity im not gonna say anything its on netflix i think go watch it
I think Incantation had a good twist. And it was super creepy.
SAW
Witness for the Prosecution
The Skin I Live In
.Just what like others had commented, memento, the prestige, the game. The others is good too, the machinist,  identity.
The Crying Game
Cabin in the Woods
Parasite
Shutter Island
Shutter Island!
Shattered. Listen, this one is a bit old and some might even say dated. But the twist is phenomenal.
Oldboy, Memento and Harakiri.
Prestige
The Game
Parasite
The Others, eXistenz, The Book of Eli
Serenity (2019?)
Vanilla Sky (2001)

The Skin I Live In (2011)
The Disappearance of Alice Creed
Better Watch Out (2016)

The twist occurs pretty quick but this movie is still so damn good!

Don’t watch the trailer though it will spoil it
I See You (2019) - it's quite good plot twist at the end, I really get wow moment.
Not in a good way, but *Remember Me*(2010).
The Invitation ...
What an ending!
Do NOT read anything about "let the right one in" and just watch it. Its starts off with "HOLY F\*CK" and turns into "OOOOh", and then its "Huh, cool"

If you haven't seen Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense", do NOT read anything about it (this will be hard). People talk about it, and I have to say I enjoyed watching it the first time.
The Game
“Frailty “with Mathew McConahey and Bill Paxton.
     
“From Dusk Til Dawn “

“FightClub”
Oldboy (2003 not the American remake)

Audition (1999)
The night house (this is so good with an interesting back story. )
Fallen is pretty great.   I haven’t seen anyone mention it.   Denzel and John Goodman are both so good in this movie.
Sorry To Bother You.
The guilty. Not the American one the danish one
Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.
Malignant,
Jeez when the reveal happens my jaw dropped.
One of my favorite twist ending films is Angel Heart (1987). It’s a modern film noir starring Mickey Rourke and set down in bayou country.
There’s a foreign film called The Handmaiden. Be aware it has mature themes- but plot twists  galore!
Last night in Soho. I was full on rolling my eyes at how obvious the plot was, but I was so wrong. It’s absolutely amazing
Wild Things .  Just watched this the other night . Do not stop watching at the credits
Shutter Island.
Behind her eyes
Censor, Uncut Gems, Horse Girl, Shutter Island, Unbreakable, The Mist, Leatherface (2017) 

Not all "plot twists" but they've all got endings that'll either have your jaw on the floor or wondering if you've just had a stroke
Watch "Don't fuck with Cats" on Netflix if u got one.
Fight Club
The game 1997
OLDBOY. DEFINITELY.
Twister
Get Out?
Honor society. Truly did not see that coming
Old Boy (the original)
Wanted
Fracture (Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins) or Primal Fear (Richard Gere and Ed Norton)
The Mist
The end of Split got me.
Lamb
Old boy.
Crying Game.  Don’t look it up, just go into it cold.
The Village
Definitely Fight Club if you've never seen that and don't know the twist, or Prisoners, Usual Suspects, The Prestige, Witness for the Prosecution, or Memento.
Oldboy (2003)
"The Others"
A beautiful mind. Great movie.
12 monkeys
Deathtrap - Micheal Cane is a washed up playwright who hatches a scheme to kill a protege and steal his work. Has about 5 or 6 "holy shit" twists and is a ton of fun to boot.
The Mist
Uncut Gems
Double Jeopardy
Bruh.

The Sixth Sense

Nuff said.  It’s literally the greatest twist of all time.
"the woman in the house across the street from the girl in the window"

not a movie but a series. i would review the end as the shittiest end of all movies that i saw (and I saw a loot of bad movies), but if it's a crazy twist you want, "holy shit" is the only way to describe it.
Parasite
fractured! it's on netflix
The departed
“Sixth Sense” or “Samaritan” have really good plot twists.
The Star Wars Saga (movies 4th,5th,6th) have great plot twist too!

You'll never guess who the dark magician really is!
The Skeleton Key
No greater plot twist than exists than in Predestination
Tusk
Haven’t checked the comments yet but I’m sure this isn’t the first Fight Club recommendation.

Knives Out (10/10) .Need Some more recommendations like this
Just saw Knives Out and i must say Goddamn!! Made my day.What a movie honestly.One of the best i ever saw.Chris Evans and Daniel Craig were such a joy to watch.Can i get some  thrillers  suggestions like this.Will really appreciate it.
For another great mansion mystery movie, be sure to check out Clue.
Logan Lucky, not a murder mystery but a fun heist movie. Plus Daniel Craig as an explosive loving hick!
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Nice Guys
Rian Johnson's earlier film Brick is a must watch. It is to the noir genre what Knives Out is to the whodunnit genre.
I completely agree with Clue here but since its been mentioned, Ill go with one that is disturbingly overlooked in these threads and that is A Shot in the Dark.
The older Poirot movies starring Peter Ustinov might be worth visiting as well. Death on the Nile (1978), Evil Under the Sun (1982), and Appointment with Death (1988) are all good. As well as the Albert Finney led Murder on the Orient Express (1974, I think?)
More of a spoof of the genre, but find Murder by Death (1976).  So many heavy hitters of the era. Alex Guinness as the blind butler steals the movie.
Identity, I always suggest this for people looking for whodunits. It's a bit more intense than Knives Out.
It does seem Knives Out is a bit of a throwback.  A couple where I saw either the movie or the previews recently are: Murder by Death (Comedy), Sleuth (w/ Michael Caine),Murder on the Orient Express, Clue, Death on the Nile (70s), Evil Under the Sun (70s), plus And Then There Were None (1950s big screen, 2018 BBC version).
there's at least one newly created knives out thread that triggers the response of 'clue' per day on this subreddit lol
Bad times at the El Royale
The nice guys! :D

The Hateful Eight
I have yet to see it, but my friend said Gosford Park is very similar to Knives Out
The Prestige (2006)
GAME NIGHT! I think both go together super well, if you loved knives out definitely give it a watch
Murder by Death
[deleted]
Crooked House (2017)
The Brothers Bloom
I never seen it, but somebody here might be able to back up... But Woody Allen's 'Manhattan Murder Mystery'? As I've said I seen it but it seems similar.
Hi, I saw Knives Out at the weekend and was astonished aswell. 
Great film making and plot twist!
I think you’ll like Murder on the Orient Express
The original is better but both are good!
Searching! Such a good movie and told in a really interesting way.
Loved Knives Out!  I am a murder mystery fan at heart.   "Agatha and the Truth of Murder" 2018 was quite good.  I have been watching the "Poirot" series and those are great too.
The only one I was impressed with was Jamie Lee Curtis; Daniel Craig was no more than a drop-in character, no sense that he existed as a person at all. But -- Curtis has another movie in this vein that was 10x as good -  A Fish Called Wanda.

You could try The Burbs, as well.
Brick. It's Ryan Johnson's first film, a murder mystery set in a high school. Very underrated.
If you haven't watched "Murder on the Orient Express" (2017), I don't know what you're doing.

It could get a bit complicated at some point but it's a great watch. Watch it. Trust me.

The Youtuber “Just Write” recently put out [a video](https://youtu.be/Icy-Im9Lyi0) about this, listing 10 movies that helped inspire elements of Knives Out.

Out of these 10 I’ve personally only seen Clue, and I absolutely loved it.
Gosford Park
Suspect - Starring Cher & Liam Neeson
Not a movie, but the Poirot TV series is a great way to kill some time.
Surprised nobody has mentioned [You're Next (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853739/) which has a lot of parallels.
Just watched it..... amazing holy shit so amazing!
Try Murder on the Orient express if you haven't already seen it.

Thx bro great movie loved It! My favorite line by random when he says, “What are you? CSI KFC?”
I think you'd really like episode 2 of season 6 of Miss Marple, "Greenshaw's Folly," about 90 minutes long. Also try The Big Sleep and Murder On The Orient Express. I'm a bit of a murder mystery hobbyist. Would love to hear what you think, especially of the Marple one 🔪🩸
I know I’m late, but an amazing mystery movie similar to knives out is “the last of shila” it’s great
If you want a good thriller watched Would You Rather it’s SOOO good, I’ve rewatched it a few times
Knives Out was great.  Personally, don't shoot me, but I think television and streaming do a better job of mysteries than movies have in this genre.  Monk, Psych, Goliath, Unbelievable, Manhunter, etc are all great and dabble in this genre from different directions. edit: Bosch, others
Murder on the Orient Express
8 Women
Not a movie but a show. Babylon Berlin is absolutely amazing.
whats this about again?
In Bruges, seven psychopaths, sexy beast, Lock stock and two smoking barrels.
Night of 1000 Hours
Knives Out is actually on my list to watch but I'm assuming its a murder mystery more on the comedy side?? i'm gonna condense my list based on ones i don't think people will comment as much besides maybe 3 haha

1. Scream (1996) - the OG slasher horror mystery with intended comedy/awareness of horror tropes.. honestly such a classic, and i hate slasher horror.
2. The Invisible Guest (2016) - mystery/thriller; this is the most recent mystery movie i've seen, it's a spanish film on netflix.. it was SO good and one of the few satisfying mystery movies.
3. Memento (2000) - mystery/psychological thriller; wild ride.. i enjoyed it a lot, love the concept a lot and i want another movie with this kind of theme.
4. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) - mystery/thriller; Daniel Craig is in this! pretty grim but GOOD mystery, there are really uncomfortable themes and scenes that i had to fast-forward through and probably can't re-watch now.. look up the parents guide just in case, but it is one of my favorite mysteries!
5. The Machinist (2004) - mystery/psychological thriller; grim but this one is super good! one of Christian Bale's best performances imo.
6. Scooby Doo on Zombie Island. no explanation needed.
It’s not a mystery but I feel like it has the same tone; Ready or Not
The Nice Guys

Deathtrap
L4yer Cak3. Early Daniel Craig role. I love most movies in this thread and Layer Cake is my favorite of all time.
Gentlemen (?)
They share similar colours, they both have great cast, both new, and both are great Crime and plot twist movie examples.
I only know this because I’m seeing it right now. The dude that plays Lombard has serious charisma!
https://trakt.tv/users/solverwren/lists/cluedo-games-and-mindfuckery?sort=rank,asc

I started a list of whodunit group mysteries and expanded it to include other games/mindfuckery with 2+ people. Opinions differ on whether various options are good or awful.

Murder on the Orient Express is the closest to Knives Out.
If you like the humorous whodunnit of Knives Out, I would definitely recommend Clue. If you like shady rich people and Chris Evans, I recommend Fierce People. It’s a phenomenal story and while it is more of a coming-of-age story, there’s a “who did it?” part.

Knives Out felt like a mixture of both stories. All are great.
A Simple Favor (2018).
"The Shape of Water" is the only other movie in recent years that shoves its "sjw" agenda in your face as much as "Knives Out", so I'd recommend that if you like that sort of stuff.  I hated both movies.
I SEE YOU

( amazon prime) 
Not an ensemble mystery...but a great thriller with a satisfying story.
Rear Window (original with Jimmy Stewart)
This movie was not that good, it got better towards the end but a lot of the dialogue was whack. The father and the nurse’s relationship was the best part of the film
Adventure Time s03e12 The Creeps
clue
The Ice Pirates
You would think that the genre "Thriller" would be pretty recognizable, but there are a lot of different blended genres out there (horror/thriller, psychological/thriller, etc.). In keeping with the Knives Out movie, these are really great. Take note, though...there is no humor in these films. However, they are star studded and great Thrillers. The first four also fall under the film noir category. Enjoy!

[Motherless Brooklyn (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385887/)

[L.A. Confidential (1997)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/)

I'd say that I haven't seen any film that quite captures the same feeling as this movie sadly and I've seen a lot of mystery films.

I'd say that older mystery novels like Agatha Christie ones are closer to capturing the same feeling than any movie I've seen, including the recent Murder On The Orient Express adaptation of one of those Agatha Christie novels.
The newest Orient Express.
For some reason I didn't enjoy it thoroughly! Seemed like I was waiting for it to end. Anyone with me?
If you’re looking for Murder Mystery, you won’t find a better story than True Detective season 1 I promise.
10/10????? More like a 6/10. 
KO is very predictable, underwhelming, and overrated. The biggest problem is within an hour, we are told what happened. The main mystery is solved, and the film transforms from a "Whodunnit" into a "How They Got Away With It". However, being a Rian Johnson flick he will “subvert expectations", of course. After that, the outcome becomes very predictable. You can easily dismiss over 80% of the cast as suspects based on... Too few lines + rarely mentioned + scarcely involved + no real self-connection to the murder victim other than being another greedy family member which is the only connection for majority of the cast + characters barely seen + little to zero motive = obviously not a suspect. 

Then you notice who is a high paid actor/actress who has been absent for most of the film. Should not be able to figure out a whodunnit based on screen presence and character time only. In a movie like Clue, every character had a good motive and could easily have been the murderer(s). KO you have maybe 2 or 3 decent suspects for 75% of the film. 

The house set is awesome, and yet it is sadly abandoned for almost half of the film. The vomit when lying characteristic was stupid, and you know it was going to end up on “someone” by the end. 
I did not hate KO. It was okay, there was some clever moments and solid performances, but nothing to hail as a classic which is what 10/10 means. Watch films like “Murder By Death”, “Murder on The Orient Express” (the original), and "Clue". Also, I LOVE Daniel Craig, but Rian Johnson had him give a charming southern gentlemen style accent. Or as it's commonly referred to many times in the flick as a KFC Colonel Sanders accent. Really Rian? Daniel is British. Have Daniel be British! British have charming accents too. Daniel Craig reminded me the whole time of Tom Hanks in "The Ladykillers". The accent was meant to be funny, and it was at times nails on a chalkboard just listening to.

Recommend: David Fincher’s thrillers - The Girl
With The Dragon Tattoo, Se7en, Zodiac, The Game. 
Off the top of my head: L.A. Confidential, The Prestige, Blow Out, Ex Machina, The Nice Guys
I hated it. I guess hate is a strong word. I just really disliked it. 

It fell really flat.
That movie blew horse dick.
Clue. The one from the 80s. Peak Tim Curry.
Suburbicon, Escape Room, Bad Times At The El Royale, A Cure For Wellness, 13: Game Of Death (13 Beloved)
The Game
Am i the only one that found this film below average? Thr plot wasn't engaging at all, the twist was disappointing at best and the characters boring. Daniel Craig was fine but he's a much better actor than this movie makes him out to be.

Like people have said, a movie like clue that basically the same plot is 100% more enjoyable.
Housebound
Knives out was on point, I would highly recommend 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Layer cake. Boom. Bonus also stars Craig.
On Amazon?
Death Trap (1982)
Try Glass Onion the sequel
you'd like the invisible guest
Suggest me something you believe is 10/10 and must be watched before you die.
Looking to expand my admittedly-limited taste in films. 

Genre doesn't matter.

Also, without spoiling the film, tell me what you like about it/how it makes you feel.

Gracias.
There will be blood.
Apocalypse Now. No other movie has been made where a film's own production failings (disorganization, chaos, constant setbacks, internal conflict) were the very reason for such an authentic depiction of the subject matter (Vietnam War). The end result is just about perfect in every way: script, acting, music, sound, editing, set design, etc.
Synecdoche, New York

2001: A Space Odyssey

Pulp Fiction

Sorry these are pretty mainstream but these are 3 of the only films I really think everyone should see before they die.
The man from Earth
Idiocracy. Easily one of thee best comedies. Sure, it’s silly and dumb but some of the stuff really isn’t all that far off...
American Beauty.

By the time, you reach the end of the movie, you can't help but bow down to the genius of Sam Mendes. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, acting (especially Spacey) everything is just extraordinary, for the lack of better word
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
Trainspotting
12 angry men! Possibly my favorite film of all time, I adore that movie from top to bottom.
Some like it hot.

The movie is just so SMOOTH.
Das Boot
No country for old men, a very profound ending and it says a lot about the way the world works
The Truman Show, it's one of the best social allegories made in film. It gives an epiphany when you finish the movie and reflect over it.
Requiem for a Dream. ( Not an easy film to watch, be warned)
Metropolis

Vertigo

Platoon

Mildred Pierce
Children of Men

It’s very grounded sci fi that makes you sad about the future of humanity while providing a slight glimmer of hope.
GoodFellas
High Fidelity is a great window into how a particular type of guy sees himself and why he is the way he is in relationships and his career. It's also does a great job of highlighting a time and a place that's now gone so functions as a kind of time capsule for the end of the 90s. Plus it's just a great music flick.
I highly recommend Guy Ritchie gangster films, mainly Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Both are absolutely hilarious and have fantastic editing. Pretty much every single line is genius and quotable. Highly rewatchable and definitely in my Top 5
2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick/1968)

Babe (George Miller/1994)

Burning (Lee Chang-dong/2018)

The Big Lebowski (The Coen Brothers/1998)

Chinatown (Roman Polanski/1974)

Finding Nemo (Andrew Stanton/2003)

Heat (Michael Mann/1995)

Interstellar (Christopher Nolan/2014)

The Lost City of Z (James Gray/2016)

Moonlight (Barry Jenkins/2016)

Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki/2001)

True Detective Season 1 (Cary Fukunaga/2014)

All powerful, all beautiful, all perfect in their own way.

(I included True Detective because it plays like a 10 hour movie and it’s the most rewardingly rewatchable piece of media I’ve consumed to date.)
Arrival
The rare film I thought about for weeks after seeing: Arrival. The script and acting, the atmosphere, the score: to answer your question about how it makes me feel? It makes me happy and sad, it makes me think about the nature of love, and family, and time, that makes me think some more. It’s a movie I’ve never seen before, which is profoundly rare
Fantastic Mr. Fox
Stop motion animated movie by west Anderson. It is just so beautifully made with great dialogue. A must see imo
Come and see
8 1/2
The count of monte cristo (2002)
Maborosi (1995)

Yi Yi (2000)

A Brighter Summer Day (1991) 

Pather Panchali (1955)

These are my 4 favourite films of all time. These films will haunt you, in a good way and have impacted the way I view myself and the world around me. In my opinion, these are some of the greatest films ever made. 

Enjoy.
Here are some of my favorites based on genre:

Sci-Fi - Blade Runner 2049, Inception, Arrival

Crime Thriller - Memories of Murder, Zodiac, Pulp Fiction (blend of genres)

Drama - Whiplash, The Social Network, There Will Be Blood

Action - T2: Judgment Day, Mission Impossible: Fallout, Mad Max: Fury Road

Superhero - The Dark Knight, Logan, Spider-Man 2

Thriller - Parasite, The Prestige

Anime - Spirited Away

Fantasy - LOTR Trilogy
Kung Fu Hustle

It's delightful, full of joy and wonder.
The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford

This movie is pleasantly beautiful.
The Before Trilogy by Richard Linklater. Possibly the best slices of romance portrayed on screen by some of the most well-realized characters.
Shawshank Redemption & Green Mile
The Fall (2006) - 
I made it a point to see all must-watch movies in my time as well, and I don't think The Fall is mentioned very often. Yet, it was THE ONE for me. 17 years of location scouting alone went into this movie. The only CGI used was to remove things from the backgrounds of shots, like cars and stuff.
My alltime favortite movie all around. Visuals, Story, Acting, Humor, Uniqueness. This one has it all!

When I watched the movie for the first time, after it was done I was sad, happy and felt like I needed to buy the bluray and watch the special features ASAP. (Was not disappointed!)
Airplane! is a must see
Silence of the Lambs (1991)
City of God - amazing movie in the vein of Goodfellas


Let The Right One In - Beautiful “horror” movie that is really a great testament to friendship and loneliness 


The Social Network - Not a bad scene in the whole movie


Do the Right Thing - IMHO the best movie of the 80’s and still resonates 


There Will Be Blood - amazing acting, amazing score, amazing direction


Before Sunset (really should watch all 3) - great love story filled with the fear of regret and consequence 


Hoop Dreams - I think this is still the best documentary of all time
Pulp Fiction! An iconic movie.
Once Upon a Time in The West and Taxi Driver must be watched by everybody. My favourite movie is Once Upon a Time in The West but Taxi Driver is especially a must watch movie.

Also Dr. Strangelove. My 2nd favourite movie.
The Lord of the rings trilogy
The Man From Earth

A most unique and intriguing film. You will remember it for a long long time.
Mad Max: Fury Road
-8 Legged Freaks, probably the best horror comedy I've ever seen.

-The Mitchells v the Machines (Netflix exclusive): An absolutely hilarious and yet delightfully wholesome movie that I'd definitely recommend to anyone with Netflix.
The Prestige (2006) 

I freaking love that movie⏳
I'm just going to say it.... Fight Club
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Memento. Best way to tell a story
Oldboy (2003)
Definitely Black Swan, fantastic movie and a visceral experience
A brighter summer day

Chungking Express
Usual Suspects - amazing cast and clever screenplay
What dreams may come with Robin Williams.
I know it won best picture, but people don't talk about *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* enough. Also *Hard Eight* from Paul Thomas Anderson. Gritty and wonderful, one for people who like casino movies.

Bonus: I know its not a movie but what I really want to say is the video game *Disco Elysium*. It is the best piece of writing I have ever read. It transcends the video game genre. It is my favorite piece of anything.
The Conversation 1974, highly recommend.
Tusk but don't Google it the twist will be ruined. It's also one of those polarising ones.
There will be Blood, Parasite, “Before” trilogy, The Social Network. And don’t know if it’s considered a movie but the new Bo Burnham: Inside is a 10/10.
The Tale of Princess Kaguya.
The Lord of the rings

Whiplash
12 Monkeys
The Usual Suspects
Movies for those who like a twisty plot that you do not see coming: 12 monkeys and the usual suspects. I can’t say much more than that - The scripts are unique and both include really strong acting.
Donnie Darko
Zodiac. 
Goodfellas. 
Double indemnity.
The Prestige
How is this a thread on Reddit and nobody has said The Prestige? I personally don’t get it – I think I need to re-watch – but people adore this film
Eyes wide shut, fight club and revolutionary Road.
The dollars trilogy- A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). 
The first half of full metal jacket. Best war film ever
The Sixth Sense

Genre: Horror/Psychological Thriller

It is a film everyone knows for a reason: great writing, great acting and very creative. It will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It is not only a psychological thriller but very, very heartfelt and touching. On first or second viewing at least, you will be on a rollercoaster of emotions. It has a great ending. It definitely leaves you wanting a sequel! 10/10.

Blazing Saddles
Tropic Thunder
Comedies that are wildly inappropriate but somehow work: Blazing Saddles and Tropic Thunder. Disclaimer: both movies intentionally push buttons and boundaries. If you are someone who regularly notices micro-aggressions (which is a great skill to have – you do you!), Both films are going to feel like a macro-aggression, so I would steer clear
In the Mood for Love (2000, Wong Kar-wai) and Hero (2002, Zhang Yimou), two films that make you feel like you’re experiencing colour for the first time.
From Dusk till Dawn- 90s crime movie starring George Clooney, and Quentin Tarantino as two brothers/bank robbers who take a family hostage to get them into Mexico. They then have to spend the night together in a really over the top seedy bar. If you're unfamiliar with the movie go in 100% cold. Don't watch any trailers, read the imdb ect...

My 10/10 movies: 
Good Will Hunting-the acting is excellent as is the story telling. The story line (I feel as this is impertinent since everyone should have seen it by now) is about a down and out boy genius who struggles with the aftermath of an abusive childhood. The relationship he builds with his psychologist, his friendships and his romance. His first date with Mimi Driver was the perfect first date. His job interviews and his ability to f*ck with his first few psychologist is so funny. I just love the scene when his best friend tells him that he looks forward to the day when Will isn’t there to go do meaningless things and then the look on his face when it happens. True friendship.

A few good men: It is the perfect  who done it when the smart ass lawyer is assigned to defend two marines court martial for the death of a fellow marine. It is all the characters combined that make the movie perfect. Kaffe who doesn’t give a shit about the military, Demi Moore who is brilliant but over compensates for it, Sam Wiseman who has no responsibilities what so ever, Kevin Bacon the perfect poised prosecutor, Keiffer Sutherland who is a cookie cutter for Jack Nicholson’s character , Lance Caporal Dawson: Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir. That’s our Code  then Jack Nicholson who seals the deal “You can’t handle the truth”
The Gentlemen - somewhat new movie with a unique narrative and very witty writing
**Donnie Darko**. It's just... so unique. I can't describe my experience with this movie without getting too emotional. Just watch it and you'll see.

**Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain**. It makes you truly appreciate everything in life, even its small annoying details. A must watch.

**A summer with Coo**. The best animated movie ever, one of my fav movie of all times. I swear it has no defaults !

**Interstellar**. A testament of humanity.

**Nausicäa**. What would happen if humanity continued to not care about climate, and also awesome monsters.

**Kill Bill**. These movies are the definition of "pleasurable violence". It's violent, and you love it because it's so perfectly made. And the animation scene in the 1st part omg !

**12 Angry Men**. Still relevant today, and a perfect example of how cinema doesn't need to be fancy to be awesome.

**Moulin Rouge !**. The most moving tribute I've ever seen, I've never wanted to go to a place so badly after this movie. It's not only a movie, it's a place of paradise, of music, of poetry, that you can come back to.

**Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind**. It makes you understand what love is really about.
L.A. Confidential. Fantastic performances from one of the best casts ever assembled. It equals the (first two) Godfather movies IMHO.
The Silence of The Lambs. Demme created a mood that’s hard to shake. With anyone else directing, I probably wouldn’t have liked it. And I’m not even a big Demme fan. Hopkins played an amazing Lecter. And how about Lecter?  Best villain/co-protagonist in fiction?

Halloween 

Psycho
From last nights question: https://old.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/o91xu4/what_are_your_top_movies_you_think_everyone/


Arsenic and Old Lace

Harvey (1950)

Harold and Maude

The Maltese falcon

Murder Ahoy (1964)

How to murder your wife (1965)

The lady vanishes (1938 or 1979)

The 39 steps (1935)
The Shawshank Redemption
Little Miss Sunshine
Lawrence of Arabia. That sunrise! 

Event Horizon. That gateway to the warp!
Parasite and Roma
Les Intouchables (The French version)

The Professional (Starring Jean Reno and young Natalie Portman)

The Transporter franchise (Jason Statham)

Django Unchained

Blood Diamond
Scarface
Roadhouse
Movies that are on the surface maybe a seven or eight out of 10, but they include a scene that makes the entire film worth watching multiple times because that one scene is more like a 15 out of 10 and pushes it over the edge: Scarface and Roadhouse.
Donnie Darko
* *Dial M for Murder (My favorite film of all time for the excellent twists and turns.)*
* *Boyz in the Hood (Encompasses the dread of being African American and how 90's West Coast living was.)*
* *Grave of the Fireflies (I legit cried on this film.)*
* *Infernal Affairs (It's a cat and mouse game like no other, in my opinion.)*
* *Dawn of the Dead (Probably one of the best horror films of all time with a message.)*
* *Les Diaboliques (Just a classic!)*
* *Jurassic Park (This film is something that every, even passive, moviegoer must watch.)*
* *The Babadook (Amazing horror done well.)*

I know you asked for one, but my mind started to wonder, and it spilled out.

Oh, and of course...*Goodfellas.*
A Ghost Story.

What does it make me feel? Just about everything. It’s a beautiful experience.
Movies you can watch with kids that don’t suck/hit the 10 out of 10 criteria: Matilda, the Princess bride, ET, Spiderman: into the spider verse. OK, maybe these are like nine out of 10, but they are friggin close to perfection. Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Steven Spielberg making a definitive film about a little boy lost – that’s a theme for him - and a cartoon that cleverly and hilariously explores the multi-verse. These are awesome
Days of Heaven

Some of the most beautiful cinematography you will ever see.
Das Leben der Anderen
The Man from Earth

The Godfather (1, 2, and maybe, but not necessarily 3)

The Matrix

Clue

Gladiator

Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The Lord of the Rings

&#x200B;

BONUS (because it's a miniseries, but it feels like a novel, and each episode is like a chapter):

True Detective (Season 1)
Memories of Matsuko.

Not a very well known movie in the west. This is a Japanese drama about a young man learning about his recently deceased aunt who he has never met.

The director, Tetsuya Nakashima (Confessions, Kamikaze Girls), is a master of building characters and the A+ acting makes this world very believable. 

This movie never fails to bring out strong emotions in me. This movie is often funny, very silly, and tragic. Highs are sky high and the lows are gut wrenching. 

I am not too good at describing films, especially ones that I am passionate about. I found this movie over 10 years ago when I was in Uni and has been my favorite ever since. 10/10
The Salton Sea. Stars Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio. It starts out making you think it's a dark comedy revolving around crystal meth, but there's a major twist and it becomes a crime thriller/revenge movie. One of my all time favorite movies that almost nobody's heard of.
Probably been said but I'd say Alien. For one that maybe hasn't been said, Hereditary.
The cook, the thief, his wife and her lover. Great film
Burn After Reading
Recently watched The Guest. Loved it.
I've yet to find a better Romcom than Parent Trap
The Lives of Others
The Thing (1982)
Farewell My Concubine

Moviewatchingprotip: Stop trying to find out what movies are about and just take them for what they are.

I started doing this after film class because the professor recommended it.

It changed my life.

I stopped reading what movies were about before deciding whether I would like them. It pushed me out of my personal genres and also got me to watch black and white and subtitled films without bias.

You can be amazed by a movie about fly fishing (A River Runs Through It) without actually liking fishing. Or realize there were mind-fuck movies all the way back to early cinema (Un Chien Andalou).  Or that a French movie without moving pictures (La Jetee) can actually be amazing.

Anyway, Farewell My Concubine (1993) is about two boys who meet while training for the Beijing opera in 1920s China.

If I had known what it was about, I probably would've skipped it "cuz I don't like Chinese opera." I would've missed one of my favorite movies of all time.
Spirited Away.

One of my all time favourite animated movies.

The art style and animation are amazing. It's got a really good story to it and the soundtrack is beautiful.

You can watch it in English or Japanese with English subtitles, but it's one of the rare occasions wher I like watching it in English.
Alita Battle Angel

The movie immerses you in this fictional sci fi world so effectively unlike any other. To top it off, u see their world through the eyes of Alita, who develops over the course of the story as a unique and complex woman
Mad Max Fury Road is excellent at show-don’t-tell, and tells a compelling story primarily through on screen action rather than via dialogue.
In bruges
Its funny, its sad and actors like Colin Farrell and brendan Gleeson shine with their performance
ITT: Every film ever made.
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The characters are incredibly well written and realistic. There's a lot of depth to everyone in the film. I think it's the most honest representation of people I've ever seen in a movie. The acting is incredible as well.
My Man Godfrey 1936. Super funny movie about a wealthy family and their new butler. It sounds lame but the jokes are really witty and its just fun to watch. William Powell and Carole Lombard are so stinkin cute together.
Alien (1979)
The Big Lebowski. Such a bizarre and hilarious film. So many memorable moments and characters.
Farewell My Concubine

Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
Starship troopers
Old Boy

I don’t know if they remade it but the original Korean version is a masterpiece.
I wouldn't watch it on a phone but Gravity is about the best way to spend 91 minutes watching a movie.

It's a very basic survival story that's super lean and exciting with incredible visuals. They'll sell you the whole seat but you'll only need the edge.
Big Lebowski. The most quotable movie of all time.
Infernal Affairs
Raiders of the Lost Ark.
2001 a space odyssey, the social network
Interstellar
Children of men

I love the camerawork and the way the movie builds up to it's emotional scenes. It really hits you hard in the feels.
Man On Wire (2008)

No film has captured human aspiration, joy, obsession, love, friendship, and striving in such a powerful and beautiful way.

It's a documentary, but filmed and edited like a heist movie.

Edit:

and Ocean's Eleven (2001). It's teeming with fun, makes you smile and jump out of your seat and dance.
The Usual Suspects

John Wick

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The Fifth Element

Deadpool

Weird, creepy and or scary af movies:
          -Under the Skin
          -Antichrist
          -The Fourth Kind

Movie with the best soundtrack:
          -Guardians of the Galaxy
Drive
Drive (2011) 

It's nothing like you would expect looking at the poster or trailer but in the best possible way. Stylish, profound, shocking, patient, and beautiful.
The Chaser for an example (South korean movie). 10/10 Ive seen it like 4 times by now, I love the anti-hero protagonist against the ultra-evil antagonist in this one. Its a pretty dark movie. 

Don't know if you've seen any south korean movies but they definitely got some great thrillers, all very dark and brutal. To name a few of my favorites:

\-Oldboy (2003)

\-I Saw The Devil (2010)

\-Bedevilled (2010)

\-Forgotten (2017)

\-Parasite (2019)
Spotlight- one of the few recent truly deserving Oscar winners i think. Fantastic acting all around.

Whiplash- incredible directing and music.

Sicario- one of the best movies to have come out in the past decade. Definitely a slow-burner.
Utopia uk.
Whiplash. Possibly one of the most awesome movie villains beside Darth Vader and Hannibal Lector.
- Moneyball
- Ford V Ferrari
- Tamasha
- Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota
- Zodiac

Mr. Nobody 
Just watch it there is no way to tell 🤯
Pulp Fiction

It's the coolest movie ever made
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb

It's pretty self explanatory if you watch the movie. I just watched it for the first time a few days ago haha.
Taxi Driver
Quite a dark movie with heavy themes, but I'd say American History X
Prince of Egypt
The Tree of Life. 

The portrayal of the idea of being grace the driving force of everything we do is quite remarkable, so is the acting by everyone.
The Wailing, Bladerunner 2049 and Alita BattleAngel are the ones that pop on my mind for me
2001: a space odyssey and Apocalypse Now.
I’m a movie feign. I’ve seen everything and love the classics. Honesty though, watching the how to train your dragon trilogy is one of the greatest movie franchise experiences I’ve ever had.
Crank 1 and Crank 2. Also, I always recommend Bigfish.
Chungking Express
Dune (2021)
HAUSU! *or* House... Japanese psychedelic spoofy horror from the 70s. No one will regret it.

Bo Burnham: Inside
The Room (2003)
Interstellar
[deleted]
Mad Max: Fury Road

Best watched on a big screen, in a loud room.
Wapakman. The Manny Pacquiao movie
Once upon a time in Hollywood(no need to say anything 
This might be the best work of Tarantino)

About time(masters every relationship shown in the movie)

A serious man(this one can literally change the way u See life)

The big short
Hannibal. Not the movie, but the 3 season tv series.
Avengers Endgame in a cinema hall packed with full of people i believe
Also Remains Of The Day.
Moonlight
500 days of summer
The conversation by Francis Ford Coppola. It came out during godfather havoc and went completely unnoticed.
12 Angry Men  
zodiac  
Spotlight  
amelie  
oldboy(korean)

memento
The Last Unicorn. 

Maybe it’s the nostalgia, maybe it’s because it contains some of the most beautiful sentences strung together in human language, maybe it’s the incredible soundtrack. It just does it for me. 

“But I am always dreaming, even when I’m awake, it is never finished.” 

“Take me with you. For laughs, for luck, for the unknown. Take me with you.”

“She will remember your heart when men are fairly tales in books written by rabbits. Of all unicorns, she is the only one who knows what regret is - and love.”
Let me recommend something different than godfather and Shawshank redemption:

Triangle
Timecrimes (Spanish)
Parasite (Korean)
Forgotten (Korean)
Your name (Japanese)
A silent voice (Japanese)
Thank you for smoking


I would strongly recommend going in blind.
The usual suspects
Spotlight

Prisoners
There will be blood- incredible acting
The departed- just great movie 
Good fellas, casino and the godfather trilogy
Gangs of New York 
Animal Kingdom- you may have seen the series based on this Aussie movie, the movie is so much grittier and my favourite ever movie.
Little Miss Sunshine! The movie makes me laugh, makes me cry, makes me hate life, makes me love it. Phenomenal acting also, strongly recommend.

On a different note, if you don’t mind watching animated movies, please check out The Emperor’s New Groove. It’s an experience.
Paterson

It's such a beautifully made movie, with poetry and cinematic shots overlapping; you must see it.
3 Idiots (2009) a Bollywood film that ends up being so much more than you think it will be after the first 20 minutes.
Amadeus. About the life of Mozart as recounted by his biggest admirer/rival Antonio Salieri.

The thematic treatment of talent and envy, of discipline and frivolity, makes it a masterpiece for me. The themes are so rich and thought provoking. Although it can drag at times, I fully believe it can be classified as a 10 out of 10. Give it a chance!
Fallen Angels (1995) 
Watching this is such a different and unique experience from a lot of other films. One of my all time favs.
Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. 11/10 imo.
The Lego Movie
 El secreto de sus ojos
To Kill a Mockingbird
Stroszek (1977)
Sling Blade in B&W
Consider classic cinema:  North by Northwest - strong performances by iconic actors and a suspenseful plot; Annie Hall - forget that it is a Woody Allen movie and watch it as a time capsule of 1970s America; The Godfather (I and II) a mob story told through the lens of family
Knockin on Heavens Door 
one of the most beautiful film ever made.
If you have never tried anime, I usually recommend: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
A ghost story, Brokeback Mountain, predestination (ethan hawke), a single man
A Few Good Men (1992)
No anime movie suggestions so far so I will give you some of my 'must watch' recommendations:

Akira (1988). It was and remains an incredibly influetial movie. There are university film classes that spend large amounts of time analysing this masterpiece.

Sword of the Stranger (2007) A fantastic movie about a desperate orphan, his amazing dog, and a wandering swordman in feudal Japan. It's a story about redemption and friendship with incredible/fairly realistic action. This movie has, without a doubt, the best dog that has ever existed in a film.

Redline (2009) It's not some cinematic masterpiece by any stretch. It's quite an absurd movie, but that just adds to its charm. The movie explores a fascinating universe and cranks the 'Fast and the Furious' style of intense racing action to a whole new dimension.

Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001) Of all the great Studio Ghibli films (which there are many) these are the two I would tell people to watch above all the others.
Come and see 1985, A true Russian anti war movie, not an easy movie to watch, but totally worth it
No country for old men
The Handmaiden, both the story and the visuals are amazing, twists and turns, emotional and dark
Upgrade
Rushmore (1998) the soundtrack is perfect and unique. It is a film that has made me laugh out loud and well up in tears every time I watch it. The characters are so profoundly flawed and human. It makes me smile when I think about it. 

Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure (1985) one of THE funniest movies that has ever existed. Not one bad scene in the whole movie. Tim Burton’s best film imo, and I love Beetlejuice with a fervor.
The Revenant (2015) because the film was shot  using only natural light. It looks amazing and story is epic too.
Back to the Future - great concept, great script, just a ton of fun to watch at any age.
Sunset Blvd., Singing in The Rain, Psycho (the Hitchcock one, not Gus Van Sant), Evil Dead 2 (you can watch 1, but they basically sum up 1 in the first 8 min, or go for broke and watch all 3. Part 3 is called Army of Darkness), Seven Samurai, 12 Monkeys,
'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' 
This movie is about facing your fears. Must watch to everyone.
Ratatouille, Arrival, Hunt for the Wilderpeople
The aviator
The Perks of being a Wallflower
Big Fish, Annie Hall, Big, Coming to America
Oh brother where art thou

Probably my favorite comedy of all time. The Coen Brothers made a modern (somewhat) retelling of The Odyssey. The music is fantastic and the acting is on point, George Clooney is especially good in this. 
I've seen it at least 20 times and it still makes me laugh.
A Brighter Summer Day
Unpopular opinion: The Intern
Swiss army man
heres one you won't ever heard of Everything Is Illuminated 2005

&#x200B;

is as funny as it can be deep, just persist on this one, keep watching you wont regret it
Paddington 2. Just warms the heart and makes you believe in a better world. 

Plus - up until very recently - it had a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes! 🍅
Beasts of the Southern Wild
Paris, Texas
Whiplash,

Gladiator,
Prisoners,
Oceans Eleven (I know but vibes)
Shaun of the Dead (2004) is one of the best movies ever made and if I could only view one more film before I died, I would choose it
It has not a second of wasted screen time, even when you think the shots are meaningless they are setting up for a future joke or calling back to a previous scene. The chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost makes for one of the best duos in cinematic history and both of them deliver their punchlines *flawlessly*. The music, comedic timing, character development, and honestly everything about this movie is perfect. Seriously if you haven't seen this yet, I highly suggest it.
The scene where Simon Pegg walks across the street half awake and into the store and doesn’t notice the zombie apocalypse might be my favorite movie scene.
There's no I in team but there is in meat pie and meats an anagram of team
I worked at a cinema when this came out. Had a couple of hours to kill after I finished work before my dad could pick me up (I was 16 at the time). The only film that was starting and would finish in time was this so I went in to wqtch it and fully expected it to be absolutely shit. I was crying laughing on my own! Still one of my favourites
That and hot fuzz!
Couldn't agree more. Every time I watch it I like it even more. My 2 favorite parts are when they run over that guy. The reverse, window roll, and calmly "you alright?" Then when Phillip turns and he's stuck in the car with the music blaring, Sean says, "Mum there's nothing left of the man you loved in there!" Immediately he turns the music off, friggin great! What kills me is I've recommendes this to a few of my buddies, and all of them hate it. Can't understand why and it drives me nuts...classless swine
The fight with “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen might be the best use of a popular song in a movie. 

Also, the visual joke setup with the bored, slowly walking people at the beginning of the movie later becoming zombies is utterly hilarious
I think we can credit Edgar Wright for helping put everything together.
Few movies are perfectly-made. This is one of them.

"How's that for a slice of fried gold?"
He's not my real dad.  He's my step dad.
You should also watch Juan de los Muertos, another horror comedy.  It is not a Spanish-language knock off of Shawn of the Dead at all, it is instead a Cuban take on zombie comedy horror.  They keep calling the zombies American invaders, which is hysterical.
If Simon Pegg is in a movie, I’m watching.
I prefer Hot Fuzz personally, never seen a movie where there's not one wasted piece of dialogue quite like Hot Fuzz. But the whole trilogy is great
This movie has one of the rarest qualities that I’ve observed is only shared by all the greatest comedies I’ve ever seen.

During my entire first viewing, I didn’t laugh once, up until a few jokes near the end.

Then on the rewatch, you cannot stop laughing every single frame of the movie. It’s so absurd and they play it so deadpan. Had the same experience with *Waiting for Guffman*.
Same! England may have been a joke in the last decade or two but I’m proud we have the two best zombies films of all time Shaun of the dead and 28 days later
Purple Rain

No.

Sign o the Times

Definitely not.

The Batman Soundtrack

Throw it.
Everytime I see my dog look up I think of this movie.
This is one of my favorite movies too. It’s so funny and genuinely clever. I love horror comedies, they’re by far the best. after Shaun of the Dead was such a hit, there were so many new horror/comedies, it seems like it really inspired a lot of film makers. Fido, This Is The End, and Scout’s Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse are all great movies that are pretty similar to SotD, in case anyone loves these types of movies like I do 😊
Hot Fuzz is better than Shaun of the Dead IMHO. Love both of them though.
There's \*click\* panic on the streets of London \*click\* as people are literally being \*click\* eaten alive... 

Yep. Great movie.
That's the genius of Edgar Wright. The man is a master of visual story telling.
But what would you watch after you reanimated?
Now you mention it I'm due a rewatch tonight.
Now i feel the need to rewatch
I can never think of vinyl records the same way….
Wait til you see Hot Fuzz!  I love them both
One of my all-time faves. So well-written, witty and even emotional. What a movie.
This and hot fuzz are my desert island movies.
The Winchester!
My favorite comedy.  

There’s a girl in the garden.
Love this film. I feel like I spot something new each time. Last watch I realized the trampoline jump was a Zombies Ate My Neighbors reference.
just watched the 4K remaster, so good!
It's a movie that blends comedic and dramatic moments well without ruining the moment with a stupid joke like Marvel movies do nowadays.
The Cornetto Trilogy is the best trilogy in terms of consistency of quality, period
##Shaun of the Dead (2004) R  
A romantic comedy. With zombies.  
>>!Shaun lives a supremely uneventful life, which revolves around his girlfriend, his mother, and, above all, his local pub. This gentle routine is threatened when the dead return to life and make strenuous attempts to snack on ordinary Londoners.!<

**Music**
The film's score by Pete Woodhead and Daniel Mudford is a pastiche of Italian zombie film soundtracks by artists like Goblin and Fabio Frizzi. It also uses many musical cues from the original Dawn of the Dead that were originally taken by George A. Romero from the De Wolfe production music library. A friend of the assistant editor on the film had been compiling music library tracks from zombie films, making finding some music for the film much easier. Before production began on the film, Wright and Pegg had created a mixtape of songs they wanted to use. The Goblin music, though, was used as a temp track by Wright in editing; he liked the feel of it so much they decided to get the clearance to use it.Bobby Olivier of Billboard attributes the initial rebirth of Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now" to its appearance in the film, which "introduced it to a new generation of listeners", saying: "Perhaps the most famous scene from Shaun of the Dead features "Don't Stop Me Now" which blares from a pub jukebox while stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield bash a zombie with pool cues to the song's hurtling beat". The moment had been Wright's idea, as he loves Queen and "had the idea of playing Don't Stop Me Now – one of the most positive, exciting, happy tunes ever – over a scene of extreme violence". Pegg explained that the fight in the pub was choreographed to the song even before it had been cleared to be used in the film, so they wrote to Brian May and begged to use it.The other choreographed sequence, near the start of the film, used different music to that which it had been set to. The original was a Cornelius song, and had been the track written in for the scene from the screenplay. Wright then heard the song used in the film, by I Monster, when editing, and felt that it worked better. The tempo of both songs is the same, so the new song fit the original choreography.

It is
 "You've got red on you" 🩸
You’ve got red on you
Just watch Spaced then the Cornetto trilogy and you've had a great weekend.
I love all three of the Coronetto trilogy
It's been said that Shaun of the Dead brought back the zombie genre back from the literal dead. First zombie movie since Night of the Living Dead '63 and Return of the Living Dead '85.
Love it. Have to watch it every time it’s on… You’ve got red on you
(Fudge, I was just thinking that today, matrix unraveled).
I've always thought Shawn of the Death as kind of a masterpiece, Simon Pegg is so darn funny, english people are so... unique xD
There’s a girl in the garden, in the garden there’s a girl.
-"Motherfucker"

-"Shaun"

-"Sorry mother. I mean mom"
So many scenes and quotes from this film pop up in my mind from time to time. And lucky for us, the bloopers and gag reel are also such a treat.
Have you seen Hot Fuzz? I like that one even more. I laughed so hard it hurt.
It got me into the zombie genre! And it’s even more fun after watching a load of zombie films since there’s references/nods everywhere.
I absolutely agree with you
This is one of those movies I wish I could watch for the first time again.
Masterpiece
Can't stand this movie.
It's really a masterpiece. Truly.
So, you said you died ?
I respect your opinion, for me it’s a very mid film.
It's... Ok. I think it's a bit overrated.
Is it though?
come come now.. its not even [top 5 of that year.. ](https://i.imgur.com/y8do55z.png)

at least thats my opinion, its too british and low budget for my taste..
Crazy once you realize that it’s basically an inversion of itself, with the inflection point being when they come across the other group of survivors who are Walmart versions of themselves
This and tropic thunder are some of the best written comedies.
I’ve never seen it
Juan of the Dead is a close second.
Its not on prime netflix :(
I think the things you said also apply to the rest of the cornetto trilogy but it is most prevalent in Shaun of the Dead. However my personal favourite is Hot Fuzz
I thought it was average 5. Didn't made me laugh even once nor it had good story.
People do know it’s a parody of Dawn of the Dead… right?
Yeah my favorite part is when he uses a racial slur.
So nobody need ever ask again. 99 mind-fuck films

What if I'm having a 102 movie marathon?
What does "The last two numbers determine what you get" mean?
This should be in the sidebar.
like how you can kinda follow the thought process. goes through david lynch then "oh yea, jodorowsky, duh"
Great list!

I'd also like to add Predestination
There is an IMDB watchlist with all these movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls076524837/

It might help you choose the movie you want to see, just use the "Refine List" filter on the sidebar to filter by movies you haven't seen, rating, year, ...
saved from 4chan ages ago, i didn't make it. i thought it would be useful to some people here
How is Vanilla Sky not on this? 
Just watched (and loved it) Coherence, and I'm not seeing on the list, it should definitely be in there (if it is, sorry, i'm blind). 
Going to print this out and cross them out as I go thru 
No Martyrs? That movie definitely fucked with me
Is Koyaanisquatsi really a mind-fuck film?
Where's Fight Club?
This list should also have brain dead(1990)
I got 99 Mindfuck Movies but a bitch ain't 1?

94 get
I’m commenting on this post so I can go back again if I’m ever in a mind fuck movie mood.
Nice, cant wait to see this on imgur
This list is [pretty decent too](http://borrowingtape.com/best-of/200-most-disturbing-movies) - a couple of rare films I never even heard of are on there and wouldn't have known about otherwise. I bookmarked it for times of boredom. 
How dafuq did the wicker man make the list? So painfully bad it fucks your mind? 
so happy timecrimes is on that list I definitely didnt think it would be on there since its so unknown 
Freaking wonderful. Although I *wish* this meant I'd never have to ask again. But there are new mindfuck movies being made all the time and I want to see them! 😃 but I have to wade through the stuff some people think is mindfucky but I find boring or cloying or etc 😟
The only problem with this is, I'm constantly searching for new movies.   
Where is Dogtooth?
Memento??
Dark city!!! Amazing
Wow just what I was just looking for. Thanks OP
Prince Of Darkness
Adaptation

Also: where are  "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" ?? 

At least include The Sixth Sense even if you're no fan of Shyamalan. 
Wow I've seen every movie on that list, FML
and Enemy! Can't trust someone who puts Being John Malkovich and The Matrix (both movies I love) on a mindfuck movie list over Fight Club and Enemy
Brazil, Eraserhead and eXistenZ should be higher on this list.
Why is Big Fish on this?
Orson Wells CITIZEN KANE
Hard Candy and Groundhog Day on the same list? Uhmmm... No.
