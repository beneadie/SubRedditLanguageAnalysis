r/PremierLeague Predictions Tournament!

What if I think it's going to be a draw?
Crystal Palace vs Chelsea only gives you the options of Crystal Palace or Draw... RIP Chelsea.
Do these still automatically upvote after voting?
1-1 Draw with Maguire scoring twice!
People seriously voting united?
Holy cow. This just came up on my feed and I clicked through it without much thought. I'm 3rd out of 34k! Wha!
*casually puts all my money on city*
Betting on United, would be hilarious if it comes true
arsenal probably
My prediction is - all games cancelled
r/agedlikemilk
No option to pick Chelsea to win?

Edit: thank you for updating!
What sport is this? I just saw ‚Äòham‚Äô and voted
If I fill this in, do I lose my points for the next fixtures? Idk what to do
Well, We have to wait 3 weeks.
Man city again, they're looking unstoppable.
Well this is awkward...
I swear to god I already blocked op and these prediction post will still show
I find it a bit strange that, recently it seems that season mostly starts with an Arsenal game.

This year, last season vs Brentford, in 2017 vs Leicester. Strange that 3/5 seasons have started with us.

Or maybe they want the season to start with laughs & banters galore!
Where‚Äôs the Arsenal, Fulham prediction
I think Giggs has got more chance of winning than Man U
We can never beat Leeds, it‚Äôs impossible, so I‚Äôm going for a draw
I‚Äôm so broke
Wasn‚Äôt the best tactic during the euros to bet for a draw every time?
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
Chelse
United love playing well in big games
Lol I only have 59 tokens
Let's go, El Sackico coming right up.
People betting on City over Spuds are mental lol
None of them. All football is cancelledüò°
The thing about arsenal is they always try to walk it in
How do we get more tokens?
I look forward to losing all of my tokens.
Is this in the wrong sub? /funny maybe but really Lol. Until Man U signs someone of at least Betty White‚Äôs caliber, we aren‚Äôt winning shat.
Have no idea how this works but I decided to do it. Idk what these unicorn points are

The London games won't go ahead. Not enough police officers
Do these tokens have any real use?
Brighton has to win so that West Ham stays with us at the bottom ü§ù
Looking at the recent form that Newcastle is and the recent injury crisis Liverpool has at the moment I stick think Liverpool will still win the game
I think Brentford CP is gonna be the best match to watch today as a neutral
A loss by less than 3 goals is a win in my eyes
Anyone but Arsenal every game. Fuck Kroenke.
I‚Äôm not sure which team ‚Äúin‚Äù going to win
Since this thing is being so cheeky can someone at least fix the ‚Äòwhich team in‚Äô grammar? It‚Äôs annoying being insulted by a moron.
Where‚Äôs Chelsea? (And don‚Äôt be a smart arse and say London)
I don‚Äôt care if I lose 100. I want Newcastle to beat liverpool
Remember Brentford when on they start of season agains Arsenal? I think still Arsenal.
I am one of the 2.18% who said Forrest will beat man city
Begone off my front page
I need Fulham to win because Mitro is in my fantasy team
It will probably be Tottenham instead of chealsa at the moment
What do I win when I guess it right?
Top 1k gang we in here
Just put 900 of my 1000 in lamo time to lose it all
\*is
Any way to watch this online yet or is it all still in the 90s?
Fuck i voted brighton to win just before I read that potter left. Actually heartbreaking

I dont watch football at all! I havent heard of most of these teams. But i got this poll and I only picked the teams I felt some kind of emotion to, even if that emotion was ‚Äúthis team has a cooler name.‚Äù Somehow i picked every choice with the majority picks. Lets see how I do
Is this even a question? Arsenal of course

Dumb question, but if someone makes a wild or outrageous prediction that seems unlikely and it turns out to be true, does it still count as delusional? This mainly applies for league positions

Andersen teasing Darwin Nunez in the Crystal Palace vs Liverpool game

This will be the study on Nunez that every manager will be showing their defenders.
Could be worse - I‚Äôve seen players been bitten for less
Darwin receiving a hard wake up call to where he‚Äôs come. He‚Äôs put a target on his back now. He‚Äôll be getting this all season
He tried to fully slap him before, lucky he missed or he would have been off even earlier.
Quality shithousery. Played Nunez perfectly and got the player sent off.
The way Andersen fell down is hilarious, like he'd been sniped on call of duty üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How I wish Rudiger was still in the prem üòÇüòÇ
Welcome to the Premier League mate
Like a fiddle i tell ya
Every defender in the league is doing this to Nunez now.
Ohh.. He has got 33 games in PL  of this waiting for him. He just put a big Bullseye on his back.
Winding up your attacker as a defender has been a part of football for as long as there has been football, Nunez needed to shut him up with a goal and instead lost his head and got a red.
I play as a forward in my team.. Most weeks you have your direct opponent winding you up, it happens at every level.. Nunez will be no stranger to this and he lost this battle
Viera drills his team well, reminds me of what he used to be like lol, proper menace 

It‚Äôs why Palace such a bastard team to beat
Andersen is brilliant and scary to play against. Great shithousery. Doesn't panic when pressed and those long passes.. He just finds forwards no matter what. :P
Anderson was class against Arsenal as well last week, what a lad
He played him like a damn fiddle!
Andersen knew his assignment
Best thing about this is the music too
Pretty funny how none of the Palace players even react to the headbutt. It makes the fall itself even funnier
cracking bit of shithousery
Darwin now let the league know he is easy to frustrate.   Welcome to the premier league my man.  It will be a very educational season for you.
I have no clue why but this reminds me of last season's North London Derby where Holding tried to get into Son's head but got sent off instead
This isn't even teasing or shithousery. It's just a centre half constantly reminding his man he's right there. Clever defending. Andersen has played him like a fiddle and he's took the bite. Can't wait to see what romero does to that long lock of hair ü§£
I love this shit üòÇ hes gonna struggle with his emotions
Played him like a fiddle. Welcome to the prem
I might just be too used to this but I've gotta applaud Anderson. Worked him brilliantly when he realized there is a bit of a temper there.

Defenders do this all the time.
Andersen looks like a rolls Royce of a defender. Wonder if this was something Viera told him to do to target Nunez
What a twat (andersen)‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say he did his job perfectly.
Andersen doesn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Nunez is obviously used to using his size to bully defenders, and couldn‚Äôt handle being bullied himself. Can‚Äôt wait to see Romero vs this guy üòÇ
As a Liverpool fan, it was a bit disappointing see him lose his cool like that and give a headbutt. Hopefully he learns and grow from this.
Welcome to the premier league
This part of his game really needs to evolve
he needs to improve his temperament, defenders will have a field day with him otherwise
He got under his skin from the 2nd foul. Gonna need thicker skin than that !
Had Nunez on a string perfect play by Anderson
Masterclass in shothousery by Andersen.  Nunez is going to need some thicker skin.
Anderson knew exactly what he was doing, he knows that Nunez is young and is likely to lash out at some point for me this is quality defending mind games.
There is a few fouls in there in fairness. Im all for the physical side of the game but it should be a shoulder or forearm chicken wing-ing. Putting both hands on the strikers back and pushing as the ball comes in should be an obvious foul.

The rule I always play by as a defender is dont put the palms of your hands on someones back, just makes it look like more of a push if the attacker decides to fall over
Had him on toast
Shithousery of the highest order. Love to see it
"welcome to the Premier League"
this is common shit in every match, geez get over it
what a nice defender
Why Nunez playing like this is something brand new to the game and doesn‚Äôt know how to behave lol. Lad is 23 cmon
Welcome to the premier league.
Welcome to the show.
Welcome to the Prem.... this will happen every week. He better man up. If that's all it took to wind him up then he won't have a lot of toys in the pram by the end of the season.
Welcome to the premier league
Klopp should have pulled him before it got to that stage
Masterclass really by Andersen and a wake up call for Nunez.
In the words of comedian Bill Burr 'the referee only sees the retaliation', Nunez was goaded by Anderson throughout and he'll learn from it. Just like Suarez at first, he used to respond to every nibble (pun intended ü§£) but when he realized he could twist defenders inside out and that's why they'd needle at him he started running rings around them. Nunez will get used to it, just like Robertson who was getting the same kind of needling from Ayew but he didn't take the bait, was funny that Robertson got subbed then almost immediately after so did Ayew ü§£‚öΩ
Palace had a game plan and executed it well, they know they couldn't go toe to toe with Liverpool so they found other ways to frustrate and stifle, 'smaller' sides will always do it, draw the big guns into their type of fight, happens with sides in the FA Cup as well, it's why you see bigger sides struggle at times at 'lower' sides...
Welcome to the Prem, Man Bun.
Haha this kid is going to have a hard time in England if he gets rattled that easily...
Poor refereeing to let it get to that point. Between the foul where he pats him on the back afterwards and the slap that just missed, Nunez should have already been cautioned and let known he was walking a thin line.
Andersen played him like a fiddle. Was class against us last week as well.
Looks like Andersen did a perfect job
Every striker has to deal with that type of thing.   Bad sign that he fell for it.
Normal Premier League defending, should be worrying to Liverpool fans how quickly he started reacting to it. Nips it in the bud he‚Äôll be golden but until then we‚Äôve definitely not seen the end of this from him
Played him like a fucking piano. Darwin will need to get more streetwise, because other players will be trying this shit every week on him now
Honestly never took much of a notice of Andersen before this BUT HE HAS MY UTMOST RESPECT
It‚Äôs all the nipple grabbing. Darwin must have forgotten his safe word‚Ä¶.
He‚Äôs such a tease
a masterclass
‚ÄúYou teasin‚Äô me, you naughty naughty‚Äù
-Darwin Nu√±ez 2022
Taking notes üìù
I rate andersen
The premier league has premium piss takers
An old Mourinho speciality this was, horrible but great from andersen
Ridiculous the amount of comments in here from people who've never seen a footy pitch nevermind played a game at any level
Now show how Haaland absolutely beasted the CB this past weekend.
Striker gets angry defender is defending
Great defending! Welcome to the premier league
Masterclass in CB shithousery frankly
Lovely to see liverpool fans sending Anderson death threats over a couple thousand 

If that was another club to their player you‚Äôd never ever hear the end of it
Welcome to the Premier League, Nu√±ez.
This doesn‚Äôt seem at all out of the ordinary from Anderson? Everything here is absolutely normal center back play.
this was lovely to watch.  proper cb.
Literally standard things defenders do.
At 0.49.. if he connected that it would have been staright red
That flop at the end was great.  Looks like Darwin needs to gain about 15 lbs.
Romero vs Darwin battle worth waiting for.
This looks completely normal, if I was a CB I‚Äôd be riding attackers at every opportunity. Shame Darwin got sucked in
vet shithouser vs. tall manchild
This is high quality defending imo, maguire needs to learn this
A master class on winding up the new center forward.
Not since the days of Richard Gough have I seen a defender get so far into the head of a forward.  Absolutely glorious.
He's going to be targeted by every team now.

Is Jota injured at the moment? Might be worth giving him a week or two off to relax and calm down, they'll need to get the message through to him that you just can't react.
This is a case study in what not to do during your home debut and another in how to get into your opponent's head to get him red carded.
Is this what he got the red card for ?
Andersen played him like a fiddle. 

Inb4 fans of draws come in talking about Romero's "shithousery"
He marked him out of the game‚Ä¶.all the way out üòÜ
So what? I played as a striker and trust me that is nothing. Theres other defenders who wont let you breath. The fact that you are too inexperienced or stupid to expose them in game does not mean you can get frustrated. There are a tone of ways...run to a second defender, run parallel, run deep and then towards the middle or the other way around. Such a terrible addition there are far better strikers
Andersen played like a proper defender. Looks a lot like a classic Italien defender.
Cuti Romero is going to love winding this guy up and I for one can't wait!!!!
*"Its a shithousery award for Andersen"*

\-That one Youtuber whos name I cant remember
This is basic 101 Centre back stuff that goes on every single game from pub football to world cup.  Why is he even reacting to it?!!
He Is a Man of Focus, Commitment and Sheer Fucking Will
Nunez is so weak mentally wow
As a non futball fan;
What the hell did I just watch?
Man thought he was Zidane ü§£ü§£
Could watch this all day. Quality shithousery
Proper defending I like him palace have a player there good on the ball too
He should watch mane clips....he used to handle bullies well
Anderson played him like a fiddle and had nunes in his pocket all game. Didnt give him a lick.
Welcome to England mate
Welcome to the Premier League.
Brilliant CB play
Darwin Nunez doing his best Zidane impression...
What a masterclass from Andersen.
Done a proper number on him.  Good defending
The lack of football knowledge here is worrying. Anderson did what he could to wind up Nunez and it worked, but a good chunk of this video is clear fouls. Nunez needs to learn like
This guy has anger issues. Looks like a cunt tbf
Nunez is a bit of a plonker for falling for the bait, but it's a little depressing to see Andersen go over like he's been 360 no scoped the second Nunez retaliates. Don't see Nunez rolling around every time he gets flattened in those clips do you? 

The headbutt attempt deserved the red obviously, but gotta say I'm not impressed by Andersen's antics.
Tremendous defending, beat him physically & mentally.
Job well done by Anderson! Just kept picking away at him
What a prissy Darwin, can't handle a bit of marking
[deleted]
He's a notorious hot head. It's not pretty but really smart by Andersen. I saw at least 2 maybe 3 earlier yellows/reds. So it was inevitable
‚ÄúTeasing‚Äù
He's too weak for the prem.
When your trick only is being an cunt. There should be booking for it

Welcome to the PL Nunez
He didn't tease him. He defended. Darwin just lost his cool. That's great defending on his part. Now you're a man up.
This is actually a Ten Hag Masterclass! He spoke with Andersen before the game abot this, and now Liverpool don't have a striker to play against us! /s
The fuck is this? Shoving the red shirt while he's walking away and while ball is no longer in play? I'm turning around and throwing hands. You can't do that in any sport without looking like a retard. No wonder soccer is so fuckin boring.
Andersen has arguably been the best player on the pitch in both games he has played this season. Quality player.
The referee should've spoken to them both before it escalated. Referees need help to control the game, they cannot keep an eye on everything. Also the manager should take some of the blame for not subbing him before he got himself sent off.
‚Äúteasing‚Äù lol he was defending him
He is a cheeky bastard that Anderson . He did yeh same with Jesus constantly troubling him , nudging him and playing for the foul . Total shithouse artist dickhead man . The headbutt wasn't even lethal a small nudge falling like a sissy pathetic .
I don't know about what's being said in the pitch, but after that second action in the video where Andersen goes to ground and stays there, Nu√±ez should've held to that moral high ground. Realizing the other guy is just acting tough but will be a pissbaby on **any** contact should give you a hint on how to tread.
Unpopular opinion: allowing defenders to do this sort of stuff breeds diving. Who wants to be manhandled like this? Make the ref aware that he's going to have to make tough decisions and keep Anderson honest.
Nunez paid the price haha. Go City
"But it's not our fault" came the cry from the scoucers
I think this new non-intervention policy by the PL is going to get someone hurt. I mean I get tatting up the opposition and it is part of the game; however, can see some super dangerous tackles happening after refs just let continued/ persistent provocation continue through the game. Someone is going to get their leg broken because of this new policy.
Please people, his name is andersen not anderson
This is why a lot of people don't like football.
Welcome to the Premier League
I don't think anything Anderson did here was a foul. Nunez on the other hand went hit out with his hands, missed a head-but before finally connecting.
Such good shit housery by Anderson
Why is everyone defending Andersen?
As much as I love it, as a defender and top Liverpool hater, this is how you make a monster.

Once Nunes adapts to this kind of treatment, he'll be killing CBs.
I would've headbutted him too tbh
I love acting. Is this a play?
Not gonna lie i dont unerstand whats going on. Dude un the white looked like he was touching the other dude alot. Didnt know you was aloud to touch and shove each other in soccer. Its kinda funny the dude in white had no problem pushing the other dude around but acted like a little bitch when he got touched. He was almost as good of an actor as  amber turd.
Nothing wrong with a little shithousery, just don't go headbutting anyone over it.
To be fair the guy should have had about 4 yellows and a penalty against him
Is he unaccustomed to top level football, spoilt, naive, just plain stupid? Or all of the above?
Can't wait for Darwin to meet Romero
Looks like good defense to me.
It‚Äôs so funny how they flop. I never understood what brings a grown ass man to just fall over and roll around like a toddler having a temper tantrum. So funny
He‚Äôs a hot head. Teams should target him & they‚Äôll get a response & possibly go up 11v10
Idk who that dude in white is Jesus he‚Äôs an asshole with no sportsmanship
Everyone gets mad when strikers dive but when defenders go down like they‚Äôve been shot to get a striker sent off it‚Äôs good defending. Backwards priorities.
Such behaviors disgust me. One acts out in violence multiple times and the other plays tough, can't keep his hands away from the opponent but cries like a little girl if touched trying to influence the ref.
This is exactly why so many people refuse to watch what could otherwise be a great sport.
They're secretly in love, and Darwin will get his payback in the bedroom.
This shit is what I hate about football
Haha seems like pretty standard stuff that defenders in the lower half of the table will do every week. 

The damning thing is that it took Nunez three swipes before he could actually make contact. That‚Äôs a pretty low shot accuracy üòÖüòÖ
Fuckin NancyüòÜ
I love that Andersen, antagonizing all game, rolls around on the ground like a little cunt bitch from a little head butt. What a pussy.
Can someone explain to a non-football person why the white shirt guy wasn't sent off for being a cunt?

I've just stumbled across this clip on my home feed and what I see is one player harassing another and then falling over like a little bitch when the other one shows any kind of resistance.  To a casual viewer,  the white shirt guy is clearly being a dickhead and should be sacked
Mr Andersen‚Ä¶.. you‚Äôre a little bitch.
Anderson is a cunt
We're here to see football. Andersen should get a red card post match for all his shitful artful dodging. Do it on the street and see where it gets you. 

Why the fuck is it acceptable. It ruins the game. Everyone of you lot a hard man all think your Vinnie Jones and you can piss on anyone? There should be a post match review by VAR and this sort of shit that ruins the game could be stamped out with 3 red cards. 

It's easy to say don't be a nub and don't bite but that's blaming the good guy. Fuck the shirt pulling, the hands on, it fucks over the football.
Can't say it was the right thing to do for N√∫√±ez, but i understand it.
If you are not convincing as a footballer, then you have to compensate for your deficits in other ways. I think it's a shame for football. Especially for premier league.
Both of them are pussys
Refreeing in the Premier League is a joke 
At least 2 of these situations are clear fouls he clearly pushed woth the ball on his feet wtf.
Anderson constantly diving as well as if he punched him, what a total cunt he was, Nunez should've injured him as passed it.off as "teasing"
An embarrassment to the game, Andersen is. Football is a disgrace now. No skill, all sensitive ballsacks.
Soccer is the softest sport now
Darwin is my fave player in the EPL atm ima Madrid fan but dude is cool as fuck. Andersen is a coward. Don‚Äôt be baited like this my boy, the fact that Cucurella can get his whole wig almost taken off with no foul and that little diving wank sells it so perfectly boils my blood. This needs to change. VAR should be able to dictate how a red card is given in the moment, aka reviewed. I‚Äôm so confused after having VAR for how many years now? And the game seriously to be honest and fair has not gotten any better. The best improvement in recent years has been goal line technology that‚Äôs about it. Refs no matter electronic or IRL are pathetic.
Andersen seems like the biggest douche in the PL
I absolutely loved the headbutt. Back off, pussy. Just can‚Äôt happen every game but I‚Äôd like it here and there
I don't think there was anything wrong with what Nunez did in terms of how I'd react and did a day life. Other sports have this kind of contact all the time and nobody dives and flops like a coward. You play stupid games you win stupid prizes. But the rules of football are that Nunez won the stupid prize for doing a stupid thing within those rules. So now he'll learn to dive every time somebody touches him and become a big flopper sissy. Oh well hopefully he does so that he can be a great striker for Liverpool if not I'll be a gigantic waste of money.
[deleted]
Anderson‚Äôs an ahole. He initiated all of it then clearly flopped. Btw, I received this post randomly and have no bias either way, just my objective eyes. (I don‚Äôt even know these players or the teams involved).
Andersen is a cheating rat

Amazing how this behaviour is not only allowed, but by reading most of the comments it's also celebrated. This is shit behaviour form a shit person. Football is a game of skill, not this crap.
Game's not gone

To be honest that‚Äôs quality entertainment. Best yellow card, love to see it.
Forest had yellow cards all around. He knew what he was doing
Least aggressive Nottingham forest player
Richarlison and Bruno Fernandes would walk into my Annoying 11
Richarlison and Bruno are the definition of if they‚Äôre on your team you appreciate their shithousing, if they‚Äôre not then you hate their shithousery.

In England, diving/bitching+complaining/showboating is going to make everyone but your fans hate you‚Ä¶but can‚Äôt deny Richarlison very effectively achieved his goal of antagonising a Forest player who then got booked.

As an Arsenal fan, I hate Richarlison and Bruno, but totally get why United/Spurs+Everton back them
Absolutely loved this
I hope he's ok after getting hit by that car.
nothing wrong with that
What even is this season?
üê¶üê¶üê¶
Absolute shithousery.
Fantastic tackle
Richy taking the piss standard
Plus the assist to Kane that followed üòÆ‚Äçüí® 

üê¶üê¶üê¶üê¶üê¶üê¶
Couldn‚Äôt happen to a nicer cunt.
Wasn‚Äôt it a bit early for something like this? Obviously it doesn‚Äôt matter now but 13 minutes of football still to play
God I miss him...
I'm deducting points for the Forest player not landing elbow first into his face.
When 4 or 5 of the forest players are on bookings, this is exactly how you get under their skin. Pretty smart honestly
Should have got a medal, not a yellow card.
Part of richy's game is ticking the other team off so they commit fouls / make mistakes. His assist today was üëå
Richarlison was upright for about 8 seconds there. That's a new record for him.
Giving Nottingham a little poke is all.
Absolute housery, shame we sold Lamela as the  two of them would be a nightmare for piss taking
somebody dub this with WWE commentary
Ex Liverpool on ex Everton
bruised egos = dirty players
Peak shithousery that
Englishmen can never play like brazilians thats why
Top tier shithousery from richarlison
Clear red card
Top shithousery!!!!
I love Richy
Johnson is my hero for doing thatüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Deserved
Youre a hardo if you don't think what Richarlison did was dank af
I love the shithousery. Was basically like ‚Äúya‚Äôll suck, this game‚Äôs over‚Äù
To someone who doesn‚Äôt know a ton about football. Was this foul done intentionally because the defender didn‚Äôt like him ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù?
When you wanna act like Neymar you better be prepared to get fucking chopped like Neymar too. Richarlison is such a ding dong.
Why do people here cheer for the real asshole committing a flagrant foul and not the player demonstrating skill and technique? Seems backwards to me.
Tell me that was red. What a dirty cunt.
Red card imo. Richi is literally doing nothing wrong
It wasn't sportsmanship from Richarlison but there's no need for that Sunday league shit...

I can't believe SkySports reported that he probably deserved it as well, and Carragher saying he (Richarlison) winds him up, yet if this was Salah he'd be creaming himself with the audacity and would be demanding Brennan Johnson be shot for making that tackle.
When you allow time and space to a player how can you then get pissed off about what they do with it?
u/redditsave u/savevideo
Yes the Welsh boys üí™
He changes the game . Period .
That's a justified instance of rolling around crying. Wouldn't call that flopping.
The fuck was that
It‚Äôs the EPL ‚Äúhow do you do good sir‚Äù üé© üßê
Ave it
The Forest player should be shown the red card
Still has only 5 cent head.üòÑ
Is it just me or are British players so fucking sensitive? Like is that really worth a yellow card? Legitimately who fucking cares?

Edit: fixed to honor the glory of the British Empire. My apologies to those that have been offended.
the magic of brazilian football bothers a lot‚Ä¶
Mission accomplished, got the boy booked. If you don't want the piss taken out of you then win the game. Eoin Jess doing keepy ups against  Rangers is in of my great football memories growing up.
man lots of shitheads in this thread. Hope you tear an acl, dickheads
Scumbag move shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged
That‚Äôs gotta be a red ngl
Surely Richarlison is the most hated player playing in the premier league either him or Bruno Fernandes
beast. love it
Id love to see bruno f and richarlison get clattered every week
Cmon Neco, you could have at least given him a knee to the chest on that fall
This is as it should be. Man showboats, man gets hit.

&#x200B;

You can do some outrageous skill in this league and people will respect it, but juggling the ball like that isn't skilful, it isn't useful, it's just being a prick. Every player on the park can do it and probably the managers as well.

&#x200B;

And the hit wasn't a bad one. I mean it'll hurt but if they wanted to do him damage then damage could be done.

&#x200B;

For the record too, Richarlison would have known what was coming. Might have even planned for it.
Sometimes when ya showboat, someone sinks ya
Nothingham sucks. Fuck them
Richarlison and Spurs. You couldn't ask gor a twattier combo
Big club mentality right there
I love Richarlison, but playing with Neymar ruined him. He was a humble/better player before that
He deserved it, he's a wind up merchant and an all round wanker on the field.
Is it just me or are Spurs playing a bit shit and winning but will eventually get found out
Well done ForrestüíØ
Whether you‚Äôre for or against Tottenham. I think everyone can agree that richarlison is a real piece of work and by work I mean shit
nice tackle
I just wish this was against Everton
Deserved.
The visual depiction of chat shit, get banged
Showboating so hard he passed straight to a Forest player. Such a show of skill that...
Lovely. Couldn‚Äôt have happened to a nicer person ü§°
He deserved it that's what you get when you disrespect the other team
God I hate Richarlison. Little prick
My boyyy Richy.  Loved this as a Spurs fan.  He knows exactly what he is doing there.  Wasting time, causing menace, then a peach of a ball for Kanes goal.  Forest have to be smarter.
Can someone explain the circumstances? Did richarlison think the whistle had blown?
Couldn‚Äôt have happened to a nicer guy
Richardson has one setting: rolling on the floor
That was fucking brilliant

Richarlison deserves every bit of it the clown
If you needed Spurs to be even more unlikeable, here‚Äôs this shitass
I don‚Äôt like this tackle because it didn‚Äôt break the shithouse‚Äôs leg.
For those saying "Richarlison knew what he was doing, he got the forest player a yellow", you got it totally wrong. Richarlison was being cocky. Forest player knew what he was doing. He knew he was going to get carded but he also knew that Richarlison needed that good ol English love tap for that and he went for it. Games not gone.
Commentators all judgemental, condemning that more than the foul. Comments on here as well, Bore off you boring shits.
Richarlison is embodies everything I don‚Äôt like in players.
honestly fuck that guy
üòå
That was beautiful. What a brainless act. From both sides, I have to say, but he reaped what he sowed.
he knew what was coming after he pulled that.  It could of been worse.
The fall on him after was probably more painful. You could see him putting his body weight into it. Love to see it.
One of the most oddly fair sequences of events I‚Äôve recently seen on a football pitch tbh
But the second goal by Kane was offside.
No one in the EPL deserves getting smashed as much as Richarlison.
I‚Äôm not upset by this, you take the piss you get what you get.
Get fucked, Richarlison.
I'm a Spurs fan but he truly deserved that.
All flash and no actual substance
That‚Äôs what you get for being fancy.
Good shithousing from Richarlison, but an injury would've been instant Karma. Should have already been off the pitch for the dive next to cook.
I fucking hate soccer.  That whole sequence by the red player was dirty, unsporstman-like,  and on-purpose.
Hope Richarlison was booked for this
In fairness - if I was a Notts Forest player I would of wiped him out
I cannot begin to describe to you how much I love this.
When you can't win by playing football, you resort to tackles like that. Good on Richarlison for winding them up. Love to see it.
HappyRoyKeane.gif
juggle like a clown. get treated like one
No respect.
All comments and hate aside, that is literally an assault. He‚Äôs made no attempt to play the ball.
Ge got absolutely baited into that tackle üé£
Respect to the guy that slide tackled. I hate richarlison. ü´°
I don't think I've ever seen someone not get tackled aggressively after showboating slightly in the premier league
Funny that he'll probably score the same amount of goals as keepy ups by the new year.
Love you Brennan
This is gunna be his only highlight all season
He's really not as good as he thinks he is.
Some of these spurs fans acting like it‚Äôs attempted murder but if it was the other way around they‚Äôd applaud it. This is the essence of British football, accept it.
Top tier shithousery
Beautiful, good work forest.
He fully deserved it for not showing respect to the opponent.
I hate Dirty challenges ‚Ä¶. Richarlison has skill and the defense is giving him all the time & space. Beautiful touches, and a beautiful game. I hate this mentality of ‚Äúmake him pay‚Äù for playing w/ deft touch and skill
Instant karma compilation
Ngl if I was on the pitch I would have 2 footed him for that
For me Richarlison has always been just a clown ü§° I fucking hate him
[deleted]
The best thing about this is that it's richalison, what a gobshite.
‚Äúthis was totally 100% for sure the real reason why we didn‚Äôt score. totally not because of a specific someone passing the ball when he could‚Äôve ran and scored. nope totally not‚Äù - a gibbs white fan
Clean tackle, clearly wins the ball
If I was his coach I would be so disappointed in him. Imagine if that tackle blew out his knee. Nothing professional about that at all.
if only he could stop rolling around like he was hit by a sniper rifle
What a knobhead Richarlison is.
He‚Äôs a remarkably smug prick for somebody who has hardly achieved anything in his career. Showboating today because they were beating a newly promoted side, mouthing off at Carragher last season after they barely escaped relegation etc. Just another inflated ego without the silverware to back it up.
Honestly couldn't happen to a more deserving player. Only player I've ever seen go down after headering a ball. Cunt.
Don‚Äôt do keep ups in a game. You deserve that shit.

**edit** thank you to the downvoters for proving you‚Äôve never played a game of football that wasn‚Äôt on fifa

Boycott the European Super League
Fans from all the top clubs, we have our rivalries but this is the time where we can stand together and put an end to this. These bankers only get paid if we ALL buy into this nonsense... if this does happen don't watch the games, don't buy the limited edition merch, don't go and watch your team play in this nonsense proposal. Boycott the lot of it and let these non-english owners know the fans are what makes football matter, not them.

Edit: great to see the support! Football belongs to the fans
How are the fans going to afford following their teams when they are playing Real Madrid one week and Juventus next week. I was overdrawn when I went up to Newcastle
They should be banned from the league.
I just started getting into the PL and I agree that this idea is awful
The clubs that are involved should be docked points
Just utter greed. Clubs like Arsenal and Tottenham who aren't even good enough to be in this league (I say this as a Spurs fan) and all the other clubs that would be made permanent are doing this because they think it's their right to be in the best leagues without having to prove it. Not to mention all the money they'll make by doing it. I hate this idea so much, and I pray it's never realized.
If my team (Liverpool) join this shambolic attempt of a cashgrab for the owners, i wont support them anymore. 

I¬¥ll go on and support (God forbid) Everton or something!
#nosuperleague ‚ùå
I'm already sick of the thought of playing Real Madrid or Juventus every year and it hasn't even happened yet. A boycott is needed indeed!üôåüèº
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2XcPq5d\_0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2XcPq5d_0o)
Im kinda out of the loop since i havent been in this sub for a long time can anyone tell me whats going on
I'm yet to find someone who supports this idea. Anyone know someone in favour of it?
Very convenient that they do this while fans aren't able to properly protest...
As a Chelsea fan I don‚Äôt want Chelsea to be in this super league.
As a spurs fan it‚Äôs almost comical , we‚Äôve been so shite this season and yet if this goes ahead we will be somehow rewarded for being shit. Whilst teams like West Ham abs Leicester have been class and will subsequently be neglected. Fuck which ever shady individuals were planning this and fuck our respective boards who have given the ok.
Well said. From an Arsenal fan.
Boycott the ESL.
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Arsenal fan
Gary Neville covered it in his interview. This is greed that is trying to destroy all the glorious past of the teams and breaking fan's hearts
I've suppported Arsenal for 30 years and the ever eroding values, corruption, and general cesspool that 'top' football floats on nowadays already has me verging on apathetic. This really would be the final nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned.

The fact that our toss-pot billionaire owner is sitting in America pushing this makes my blood boil.
Spurs fan and agree!
i‚Äôve loved liverpool for so long but im with gary neville on this, this idea goes deeper than just football and all the teams even considering it should face repercussions. time to find love in a new team if it goes through.
As a Leicester fan my first thought was to repel this but then thought without the big 6, we‚Äôll win trophies galore. But it won‚Äôt feel the same without the big six and I can‚Äôt imagine the other leagues are different.
The greed has just become embarrassing. Shameless absolutely shameless. Boycott european super league.
Been supporting Chelsea since 07, I would rather get relegated to 3rd division, lose every single player and what not to just not enter this stupid fucking league.

I feel disgusted and betrayed by this club, even if it doesn't go through, the feeling of knowing that the club would've gone behind the supporters' back and do this is already pretty bad.

Fuck Roman and everyone at the top of my club for even thinking thinking about it.

Any type of fine the FA and UEFA give, won't ever be enough.
Literally every single fanbase agrees with each other on this one, and if that happens, you know this idea is total shit. Fuck the Super League, I have never been so ashamed of being a Man U fan, even at the worst moments.
Feel sorry for fans of the mentioned teams. 
If it does get confirmed then I hope to see players, managers and staff walk away. It‚Äôs quite clear the fans will.
Also part of me as a neutral would love the big teams to be kicked from the premier league as it would be more competitive for everyone else. Support a new team the lower leagues.
This is a nonsense lucrative idea for the ignorant owners for the likes of Kroenke and Glazers. I would immediately stop watching football if those knobhead chairmen decide to go through this.

And screw you Florentino Perez!!!
I don't think any real fan would disagree


>fans are what makes football matter

Sadly local fans don't matter to them.

Global tv money matters. 

They've bought the soccerball clubs, now to maximise their profit.... all about the money for them.
I will not spend another dime or another hour supporting Chelsea if this happens. I love this club second to my own family but I can not continue to send my money to that greedy fucking imposter Roman. He can take his billions and fuck off back to Russia, I'll gladly watch Chelsea of the 80s & 90s over what he's about to make them.   


I will absolutely be boycotting Chelsea if this league happens and I'll be supporting Rangers up in Scotland in the mean time.
The day this league starts is the day I stop watching football.
My enjoyment of the sport has been wavering for a while now for a multitude of reason but this is absolutely just too far for me
Even if the clubs involve backtrack on this, punish them **heavily.** Either a 20 point deduction *each* or even, relegate the "Big 6" and promote all 6 teams in the playoffs & automatic spots from the Championship. 

I'm absolutely disgusted by all clubs involved, Arsenal and Tottenham don't even have any European pedigree?! City have never won a European title? United went out in the group stage? 

It's an affront to real football and if it were to ever happen I'd turn my back on the sport completely.

Every league in Europe needs Germany's 50+1 rule to prevent abhorrent greedy businessmen trying to do things like this.
Fuck them . Once they're out they're out. No players can play for England or their national team. 

There will be teams like my team (arsenal) who finish down near the bottom each year and will regret it about 5 years down the line..... well tough titty.

Fuck those clubs just fuck em
I‚Äôm all for giving clubs more power, the proposed changes by UEFA are also ridiculous. But I‚Äôm washing my hands of European football if the national leagues start hemorrhaging clubs  because of some stupid super league.
Chelsea fan 100% against a super league. All clubs involved should be banned from domestic competitions..
I am so disgusted I don‚Äôt care what happens I am never giving another penny to the glazers no matter what. Let them cancel it tomorrow and I‚Äôm still done. The sheer greed and audacity of these scumbags, I want nothing to do with them. 

And the fact they are hiding behind covid, and how the money will help blah blah blah tell me how the money will help anyone sat in an Americans bank account offshore somewhere fucking clowns. 

Cancel everything ASAP.
Total disgrace for the clubs who join this... I am not a hardcore follower but i am team Manchester United, if they do this i ain‚Äôt watching, then i rather watch domestic league and maybe Leeds United. Greetings from Norway.
Lifelong man utd fan. Season ticket holder for 10 years. Disgusted and appauled.

I'll not be renewing my ticket. I'll NEVER watch a game with utd  if this league goes ahead.

I will do the unthinkable for any football fan and support a team outside of this abomination of a league. That is so so so difficult to say. Literally hurts to think about.

Football is a fans game. Fuck these invisible American overlord cunts who have no appreciation, nor do they care, of OUR game.

I hope they are banned from all domestic and international competitions if they push ahead with this. We can't let them kill our beautiful game. Fucking twats.
super league is a shitty and greedy idea. Fuck these guys
I will trash all my United gear if this happens. Been a fan since I was a kid and it would break my heart, but this is ridiculous. Greed on top of greed. What a disgrace.
I will not watch a single game from this League.

Greetings from Denmark.
We can only win if we do this together
This will work as well as boycotting pre orders of video games
Tbh the joy of these clubs being punished and this whole thing backfiring is more exciting to me than the actual prospect of the ESL.
Kick them out the Prem, ban the players from the World Cup and boycott the super league matches. Let the fuckers starve. Who gives a shit about a jumped up preseason tournament anyway?
It would be good to see the die hard fans of these clubs setting up pickets outside of stadiums on match days, shame anyone that crosses it.
As a Chelsea supporter, I am resolved to never watch a single "match" from this European Super League, especially a Chelsea match.
I am no longer a Liverpool fan, not even a question really, I don't think it'a acceptable really for anyone to follow it or any of the teams at all sorry to say
I'm an American, watched the NFL for 15 years, played varsity (American) football for 4 years in high school. I stopped watching the NFL 10 years ago and stopped following American football altogether when I really discovered English football. For all the US claims to be the center of capitalism, our sports leagues are as socialist as it gets. I mean, you get rewarded in the NFL and NBA for being the worst team! You literally get handed the best young player in the next draft when you finish last! Without promotion and relegation there are no consequences for failure and therefore success is meaningless.

This is exactly what the ESL will push European football towards if we let it take root. No matter what happens fans cannot watch these matches. Fans need to lobby their governments to support the domestic leagues and Champions league in anyway possible while they fight off these parasitic owners. That may mean the UK bailing out the Premier League if they decide to boot the big 6 clubs and suffer financial penalties from their TV contracts as a result.

It also means finally shutting down this line that "football is a business". NO! Football is a cultural institution and we cannot have owners anymore, we need to have legal custodians of these clubs, allowed to run and profit from them so long as they abide by fundamental principles. If the custodians fail to uphold those principles then the club can be removed from their custody and sold to a new custodian. It's a similar setup to the "Fiduciary" status in the US. This is how sport should run.
I think the biggest thing we can all do is not watch the games. It's become pretty clear that broadcast rights is where the most money comes from and if they have no viewers then they have nothing. Also don't interact with any of the social media posts because again, engagement = money
Gutted to support Chelsea.Absolutely betrayed by my club.Bye Chelsea you clowns.Hello Aston Villa
Fans can find new teams to support. I‚Äôve seen a few comments from Liverpool fans saying they‚Äôll support Tranmere Rovers from now on.
Man Utd and Man City fans could support Oldham, Mossley A.F.C, Salford or FC United of Manchester instead. There‚Äôs also plenty of London based teams for ex Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs fans to support.
Remember, you don‚Äôt have to support these greedy banker teams. Lend your support to grassroots and lower league football instead.
All the tough fans who are calling boycott will watch the very first match of the new league that is being formed. And that's not anything against them. Fans will go wherever their clubs will take them; however radical the change may be.
I‚Äôm just going to be honest here; I don‚Äôt think that many people will follow through with the boycott. The bark is usually worse than the bite.
Definitely. I will follow but I will certainly not watch.
You realise that people in England boycotting anything is kind of pointless. All of the Super League matches will be played in places like Abu Dhabi, Singapore, New York etc. If people in England start boycotting games, it‚Äôll just give them even more of a reason to start the Super League and just get their audience from elsewhere.
Can someone explain to me a little bit what this European Super League is about? Google didn't help so much. Thanks in advance!
Chelsea fan here. Fuck the European Super League and fuck all the owners of the clubs that support it. Punish the clubs, deduct points or even relegate them and let the remaining clubs battle it out for the top 4 places. The matter has really gotten out of hand. Disgraceful act of greediness and selfishness.
Trust the glazers to be on-board with this shite. Fuck the super league
Boycott Europe.  Period.
I'm in
im also arsenal and i agree
I'm an arsenal fan. Ban these greedy owners and Satn Kroenke
What is there to play for in this League? Noone get relegated. Noone gets knocked out of the competition. Nooone gets promoted to play in a higher level competition. Seems like none of the players will compete internationally. Same teams play every year. Sounds like something that would be fun on FIFA but not real life.
Hit them where it hurts, their pocket. Boycott their sponsors, force the high profile distancing of brands from those clubs involved.
Fucking disgusting, that being said, please let them  leave. The government and local law enforcement can easily deny them permission to hold events meaning at best they can host events without fans meaning any local support will disapate. People will talk about global demand sustaining such a venture but if players are banned from representing their country, and the viability of such matches taking place under threat it will hopefully, and I stress hopefully, die a slow death. From that point force those clubs to rejoin at the bottom of the pyramid and at least for those clubs in England a minimum of nine years to rejoin the premier league will be the sweetest thing I will have ever witnessed.
Boycott. And kick them out of Premier league.
I‚Äôm not in favour, but also think the Champions League is a soulless cash grab, so fuck that too.

Also, fuck UEFA. Corrupts twats.
The same thing happened 29 years ago to form the premier league. How is this any different?
As a Liverpool fan I think the EPL and the English government should take legal action against the owners of these clubs together with UEFA demanding these clubs be sold back to the fans for at least 51% like in the Bundesliga.
Can someone explain what‚Äôs happening please?
This will be the biggest transformation the sport has ever witnessed. It's essentially history to domestic leagues because anybody with any type of talent will play in this super league.

Mbappe won't just walk to Madrid he will sprint along with his bro Neymar. Haaland, Sancho, Reus will all leave Dortmund etc... 

Bayern and PSG are going to be forced to join otherwise they risk all their players leaving.
This is the direction sports will start to take. Team's identities won't be the cities they are located in and the culture of these places. It will be large corporations. We'll start to see teams rebranding as the Amazon Packers or the Walmart Whales, etc. Sad really. I'm a Man City fan, I really hope they don't end up joining.
This is the almost exactly the same as the top 0.1% getting to keep all the profits by leeching the 99.9%. 

The statement about the domestic leagues benefitting from the ESL is the same promise as that of trickle down economics that was touted to help the middle class. 

This is absolute bullocks and all the fans should protests this and even boycott if it comes to that.

Please please everyone make your voices heard and boycott if this goes ahead. 

Unite with Liverpool's fans before their game and make it known.
I am a life long Chelsea supporter, but if they even kick a fucking ball in practice, I can no longer support them in good conscious
Anyone else feeling depressed? Heartbroken hearing this news.
Ban the teams from domestic competitions, the players from international football, the use of the word football from their promos and block any future transfers of players to those club's. The competition would suck after a few years and disband hopefully! Also if a team rejoins the domestic competitions they have to start in lowest professional league.
I would like to congratulate all the founders of this Super League. They‚Äôve united fans from all walks of life and rivalries into a unified hatred of this blatant money grubbing BS. 

Gary Neville is getting heaps of praise for his reaction and rightly so. I‚Äôd go even further: they wanna play in their own rich assholes league? Fine. Expel them from the FA and La Liga and Serie A.
Spurs and Man city fans need to protest this at Wembley for the final this week
Thankfully Southampton isn't in this shit competition so I'll still watch Saints games.


Fuck the owners
United fan man and boy...over 40 years.

I will not set foot in Old Trafford again if this happens.

I will not watch them on the TV or buy any of their tat.

Greed is killing our game.
I‚Äôm properly confused by this whole thing. 

So it‚Äôs a league of meaningless friendlies between some the richest clubs in football? I assume they‚Äôll play games at odd times on weird days to allow for live games to be sold worldwide?

Is there anything about this being some kind of touring thing? As Man City play Barca but it‚Äôs played in Kazakhstan to increase awareness and market share there?
I don't think Gary Neville has ever been so fucking spot on about an issue. It's disgusting.
In a perfect world they should all be kicked out of the PL. But its not going to happen. They knew there would be this reaction. The money now is in the far and mid east. If they get a TV Deal (and they will)  the PPV will more than compensate for the loss of the home fan (and each team will be playing their matches as exhibition events all round the world in any case).

Then SKy's lawyers come after the PL for the TV deal money back because the big viewing figures  arent going to be there anymore. Its going to be who blinks first and taking into account the views of fans wont even register.

This idea is the brainchild of Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and the three US owners of Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal - Henry, Glazer and Kroenke respectively. The whole thing is being bankrolled by a Wall Street bank too, namely JP Morgan. This is the USA trying to fuck with our game again, like the World Cup in USA '94 when they wanted to make the goals bigger to make the game more high scoring and then the idea of splitting the match into quarters so they could squeeze in more ad breaks. This whole thing stinks of last week's hot dogs. 
I love what the Liverpool Supporters Group 'Spirit of Shankly' tweeted:
'Football is ours, not theirs. Our football clubs are ours, not theirs'.
I wont be watching it. I wont even be watching premier league games featuring those teams if this goes ahead. Would be amazing if our boycotting could make them even less profitable than before.
Isn't this the entire concept behind the MBA, MLB, NFL etc?
Not just top clubs. Fan's of every club, from the top of the Premier League to the bottom of the non-league pyramid, and even those casual fans who don't support anyone in particular. Boycott anything that could put money into the league's pockets. 

Don't buy shirts or merch. Don't visit their websites or social media and certainly don't watch the matches, either legally or illegally(even though pirate streams, they can claim there is demand for the competition).

We, as fans, have been bending over for the greedy bastards for years. From replica shirts costing in excess of ¬£50, to match and season tickets needing a mortgage, and even TV subscriptions going up and up, we have stopped being supporters and become customers. 

Now is the time to get together and show the powers that be that they are *nothing* without the fans!
The top teams that join the super league are pretty much not caring about the fans. Football is made for the fans by the fans and stolen by the rich. I‚Äôve been a Man Utd supporter for as long as I can remember, and I‚Äôm absolutely embarrassed that our club, which was created by Manchester locals are discarding the whole history of the club just so the chairman‚Äôs can fill their pockets. 
Liverpool is also another club that should be ashamed of themselves, their motto YNWA (youll never walk alone) is now ironic. PSG, Dortmund and Bayern have rejected the league because they know better, they know that the fans are what make or break a football club. They actually care for the club, whilst every other club that‚Äôs thinking or a break away should have their points deducted and/or relegated. Let west ham or Leeds win the league I don‚Äôt fucking care, just do something to show the majority owners know that they can‚Äôt fuck with our club. If man utd go through with it, I‚Äôm turning my loyalty to Leeds. 
Fuck. This. Shit.
Fucking Arsenal manage to get a draw WITH FULHAM! NOW THEY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ELITE CLUB LEAGUE?

fucking Kroenke twat fuck.
We should start calling it , American Soccer Super League in Europe
Take the money you would spend on TV, tickets flights hotels etc and support your local non league club.

A local club for local people.

Best of all you will have a tasty wedge left over to spend on other stuff and you will get to see some football. You have the added bonus of non league football being pure comedy on occasion
I think this is all a poker play. That being said, if this goes through, they should 100% ban the ESL teams or regulate them. Liverpool's match against Leeds tonight doesn't mean a damn thing now. Let the other teams compete for the league cup and fuck the other clubs.
They call it a League, but:

>20 participating clubs with 15 Founding Clubs and a qualifying mechanism for a further five teams to qualify annually based on achievements in the prior season.

Seems to me that the threat of relegation is part of what defines a top league?  But in this endeavor, there is never any relegation threat for the Founding Clubs, who form 3/4 of the 'league' (the other five teams will vary each year, to add a flavor of promotion/relegation).  So it's not really a league, in the same way as Champions League, where you have to re-qualify every year.

The Founding Clubs would *like* to participate in the ESL alongside their current domestic league competition, which certainly means that they would need to pull out of some of their domestic cup competitions.  So those competitions would certainly be devalued.  

I don't think they WANT to destroy the domestic leagues or league cups.  Their motivation is just to make more money, and for these clubs, that destruction would just be an unfortunate side effect.

Will definitely boycott this abomination if it ever materializes, and even if not will have to think about whether I can even support the Gunners going forward.  Have to see if it is possible for the soul of the club to defeat the Kroenkes.

#WESAYNOTOSUPERLEAGUE
I am (probably will be 'was' soon) a Man United fan. If ESL is going to happen, I am going to support West Ham and Leicester City.
You should be mad at the clubs not the bankers.
Lifelong Chelsea fan. If they join the Super League I won't ever watch a Chelsea game again.
For me its probably easy to say, as a supporter of a small club. We probably didn't even got an invitation. But if the directors of Ajax would decide to join the super league and betray everything the club stands for it would probably be the end of football for me. I would turn my back to Ajax and to football. Its not even the selection procedure that makes this competition disgusting. Its the Orwellian equality; all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. 15 founding clubs can find the goodness inside to invite 5 poor basterds to come play every year. F*ck off! A closed competition with invitees isn't competition its theater.
Killing the Super League. Buy GME. Jp morgan will go broke and the super league is no more.
Buy Gme and Hold safe your game.
What I understand of this is that top clubs are protesting the new "Swiss" Champions League format.

&#x200B;

I say we wait and get the full story before riding the emotions train the media will paint for us.
If it doesnt have VAR, I‚Äôm interested.
Liverpool fan here. I agree with you. I'm interested to see what players like Trent do, is he really going to become a traitor to the community out of which himself and Liverpool FC came, I have to assume not. Crazy shit!
Why you guys love FIFA so much? FIFA is the most corrupt institution of them all
Lol. Where was everyone's righteous anger these past 20 years when Chelsea and City were buying league titles with dirty blood and oil money? Where was FFP and the FA?

UEFA has failed to protect the game against monsters like City, PSG and Chelsea. A Saudi bought Newcastle was next... 

The corruption at the FA, Fifa and UEFA has caused this. They all need to be reformed. 

I don't agree with a new Super League,........ but I get it.
I actually kinda like the idea of the super league
Calling for boycott against the Europen Super League in a sub dedicated to the Premier League is a bit ironic, don't you think?
wait so joining the super league would mean not being part of the domestic league ? that‚Äôs messed up. until i understood that i thought a super league would be a good idea
I really don't see a bunch of fat neckbeards from Reddit making any difference
Can someone explain what this is all about? I thought It was just another league among the prem and champs
 Is this that bad an idea though. Lets be real, who wants to watch barcelona vs cadiz or man city vs plymouth fc? The big clubs have no obligation to carry the little clubs. UEFA are the once causing trouble, they are the ones that are threatening eviction of the big clubs from their leagues. If you read the press release, the super league is played alongside everything else. This is just capitalism
The sub is already named premier league. Let's just start talking about Indian Premier league. Cricket all the wat bois
nah.. where can I buy tickets?!
Seen the idea floated around and not sure on the legalities, but seize the clubs. Government should take these clubs back from foreign owners, then consider banning foreign ownership. I don't care how nationalistic it sounds, I'm not even British by birth either, but keep English football English.
Forest fan here( don‚Äôt start) just like to start a bit off topic by saying. We always claim to be the best country. We ruled 1/3rd of the world for decades. We don‚Äôt like to admit it but we are a shadow of what we once were. I feel as if the only thing keeping the country together is football. No matter the team. Your local boys on a run down pitch on a Sunday or your top 6, these are what keeps us as a country together for the most part. You only have to look at the World Cup 2018. Atmosphere around the country game after game, pint after pint ( many thrown in the air ). Football brings us together no matter the circumstances. We can‚Äôt let these money hungry owners take what we hold dearest to us. Let alone the American ones who already want our healthcare ( I don‚Äôt like Americans. Put that on record.) So to bring things to a close, football is who we are, we need to keep it that way. If u support the big 6 and this happens. Boycott. No fans means no income for the ‚Äúsuper‚Äù league. And for all you fans of the Italian and Spanish teams. Think of your own equivalent of what football means to your country. Long Live British Football
Gonna get down voted but these are my views - 

I'm an Arsenal fan and I don't see the big deal. I'd rather see us lose to Juventus every week rather than Aston Villa. As for people complaining about corruption, fifa and uefa are no better. As fans we end up supporting one corrupt group either ways, might as well support the ones which give us the best games. I also recognise the fact that Arsenal probably don't belong in the elite but if they were to do this properly with salary caps we could actually get a much more competitive and interesting sport
Make them Bleed!!!
Anyone want to EL5?
Did Brexit have anything to do with the economics of the game and where the money in Europe is trending?  Asking because I don‚Äôt know enough about the macro economics of that decision.  The largest economies right now are the US and China.  Britain just doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs positioned to keep pace with change on the global stage.  That said, I miss London and Manchester and can‚Äôt wait to go back.
Could someone explain to me the Super League? I know the teams in it so far but how does it effect the PL?
No fucking chance this goes ahead people will genuinely boycott, rest of league would go bankrupt with the wages they have and no television and less matchday revenue bullshit this is and will blow over in a week
As an Arsenal fan, I'm fuming.
Good. But UEFA need a slap in the face too.
greed, just greed. nothing else. 

no we love this game not for some but for every team participate in it.
Given that UEFA put out a statement that says they‚Äôd  ‚Äúban all clubs from participating in domestic, European, and international play, and that players could be denied the chances to play for their national teams.‚Äù I have to believe that it‚Äôs dead before it begins right?
How greedy can you get? Most of the teams on this list are worth more than 600 million!  And they are willing to destroy an institution to make more. And this has nothing to do with giving the fans a better product, this is just true greed.  Punish them all
The fucking balls of these top 6 especially when apart from Manchester clubs and Chelsea the other 3 might no even be in Europe next season, yet they wanna be in a league with no winners or lossers.
Unless you're an elitist or someone who doesn't have¬†desire¬†for the sport, majority of the fans will not want this¬†to be¬†incorporated.
This aggressive commercialization of the game we love will be a lost cause. As an arsenal fan i am furious as to how have we even got to this stage. We cant even qualify for top 8 atm but look Jp morgan is pumping the money for a league with names big names threatening the football base alll over the world.
The irritating thing about this is that I'd genuinely support some kind of alternative to the bullshit, corrupt way that UEFA, FIFA etc., are all ran. They're all corrupt and don't care about grassroots football. The FA will bitch about this because these clubs make them money, but the fact they cared so little about a historical club like Bury going out of business tells you where their priorities are.

So I'd be all for something that puts football back into the hands of football fans and away from the greedy, corrupt monopolies running the sport.

The problem is...this is no better an alternative. Its just as corrupt and greedy, but with the added sprinkling of elitism and being a closed shop.

So I can't back this. I support boycotts of the World Cup in 2022, I'd support a boycott of the Champions League, I'd support a boycott of the FA Cup but I can't support this.
I get the impression that the clubs know this will not happen.  I think they're doing it to put pressure on uefa to have the richest clubs automatically qualify for the champions league.  UEFA look like they're already announcing something like this on Monday and to take pressure off uefa to back down they're announcing this nonsense so everyone's anger is about this and not about UEFA letting rich clubs automatically qualify for the champions league.
All fans should boycott everything. Don't spend a penny on football until the PL do something radical to punish these clubs. Watch on illegal streams, don't give them any TV money.
There are two ways this could go if there is a Super League and neither of them are attractive to me.

1) The new league is a financial success, the elite tier of Football becomes the closed shop that it already so very nearly is, people still watch it and financially support it in their droves. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. The league system and grassroots Football is left to fend for itself and the final stage of the corporatisation of Football is complete. I think this is most likely as I can't see big enough numbers of fans abandoning their clubs on principle and those backing this are pretty sure in their financial calculations that there's plenty of global fans ready to lap this up and pay vast sums for it.

2) The new league fails, and the elite tier drags everyone down with them, leading to the bursting of Football's bubble. This is far less likely in my opinion, but the result of this is financial armageddon which will likely end up punishing the smaller clubs hardest and leading to many clubs lower down the leagues folding in order for the big boys to keep as many of their precious coins as possible.

Football's future is grim. I'm absolutely not on the Super League train, but I'm aware the results of its potential failure will be borne by those who least wanted or needed it.
Intrigued to see how much bottle the big 6 have in 50 minutes
I haven‚Äôt seen any fan agree with the super league proposal. It‚Äôs just so daft and greedy and I can‚Äôt help thinking of American influence here.
FIFA and UEFA have created this by letting corruption and money run the game, they need stronger regulating and rules around that, so do the clubs. Having said that this is a clearly stupid decision by the clubs involved, they‚Äôve put their fans behind profits. Disgraceful
Easy deterrent. Prevent them from competing in the FA Cup and any other domestic tournaments. Also, if the league does go ahead and then fails miserably force the teams that took part to rejoin the English Football pyramid right at the bottom in non-league football.
I will cease to support Chelsea FC if they join a closed league outside of the jurisdiction of the FA and UEFA. They already make so much more money than most clubs in the division, and staggering amounts in comparison to those further down the football pyramid. 

It's a cynical cash-grab and would complete the transition from sport to entertainment entity. Any clubs which agree to join should be immediately expelled from their domestic league and European competition. It's a complete disgrace.
Time for ‚Äòtop‚Äô 6 fans to pick a second team it seems
Can anyone give me a quick run down of the whole thing pls
[deleted]
Honestly so disappointed in some clubs. This just destroys football.

I'm a lifelong United fan, but I firmly believe that if these six clubs go through with this they need to be expelled from the Football league, and when they inevitably come crawling back they need to start back at the bottom in the lowest possible tier. A decade out of the top flight should be a minimum punishment for what these greedy owners are trying to do!
Sign the change.org petition just set up so we can present our numbers in a convincing manner. My football club Man utd dies to me if it goes ahead.
Could we somehow get United's homegrown squad to all move over to FC United of Manchester with Ole? There's no chance that the players and coaches are on board with this, especially if they are banned from representing their countries.
Honestly if this really happens. 
Don‚Äôt think il ever watch again. 
I truly feel disgusted! 
Sky ruin football and this will finish it off!
This is the biggest, most brazen show of greed ever. Disgusting behaviour from all clubs involved. They should all receive the harshest fines, sanctions, and anything else that can be thrown at them to let them know exactly how pissed off we are as fans.
I would think that a smart idea from the English FA would be to not use any English players who compete in the European Super League which would forced all English players out of that League and make those clubs shells of what they are. And any English players in those Leagues would certainly lose all respect.

It may mean the nation taking a hit for maybe a world cup/euro turnover but it may end up doing us a world of good.
You misspelled wankers
Been supporting Liverpool over half my life, and it is beyond disgraceful that the owners of my club is all for this greed, knowing full well that they don‚Äôt have the best interests of the club and the supporters at heart. 

I‚Äôd stop watching them if it meant they come to their senses and realise fans and football come first. It‚Äôs gonna be painful, but the shame and disgust of continuing to play for the benefit of selfish billionaires is far worse
I've heard of this ESL before, but could someone please explain it to me and why it's controversial, please?
If Arsenal persist in pushing this elitist bullshit greed I will walk away. The elite players under contract with these money grubbing schmucks better smarten up or they‚Äôre going to find themselves banned by FIFA.
To hell with the esl
FUCK THE SUPER LEAGUE - a Chelsea fan
Can UEFA block players from those clubs from playing UEFA and possibly fifa international tournaments????
Forest fan here, I agree completely. Ban these rich wankers.
Boycott it, cause chaos, bombard message boards. We will not go silent. We might have our team rivalries and gripes but this could be a drawn out death of football.
 This is our religion that we worship in our own way in stadiums, in front of our tvs and with our friends and foes. But what truly unites us is our love for the game that has given so much.
Everyone needs to have a voice on this. Fans, players, staff. Get on it and do the right thing
Fuck this absolute shit, I‚Äôve been a United fan from birth, seen the good seen the bad but if this absolute shite goes ahead I‚Äôm finding another club, fuck the vultures, you can have the banks but football will always be ours
Is there a petition we can sign?
The best way for this to fail is if we don't take part in it as fans.
I‚Äôm all in with this.
We can‚Äôt even do well in our own league so who thought it would be a great idea to literally make a league where we can‚Äôt win. They just don‚Äôt seem to care anymore football is dying
So the European Super League would basically be MLS, if MLS had high quality teams. 

MLS is a pay to play league, I imagine expansion into the Super League would require paying a large fee in which the current owners all get a taste, like MLS. 

Instead of MLS being influenced by a proper Football league, the pay for promotion model of MLS is tempting greedy owners who want to increase their profits.
im a chelsea fan and im fully embarrassed we stand together ü§≤
To me, it is a really exciting prospect, but if it is run by the football clubs themselves, with no monitoring by UEFA and no qualifying system then I would wholeheartedly object to this project.
I don‚Äôt think players will sign for a club knowing they won‚Äôt be able to play in the World Cup
Agree, shockingly immoral.

Everyone proceeds to cheer
Sung to the tune of Lola by the toon army a few years back. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the worlds most fanatical fans, we have Shearer and Ferdinand, and Ginola, la la la la Ginola‚Äù
My favorite was about Luis Suarez after.. I forget exactly. I think he refused to shake hands with a black player. Was it Ashley Cole? Anyway:

He cheats! He dives! He hates the Jackson 5!
When Schmeical played for Leeds, and also Alex Bruce, the chant to both of them was

Your dads a cunt, but you‚Äôre alright,
Your dads a cunt, but you‚Äôre alright.

Used to crack me up
Sheikh mansour went to Spain, in a lamborhhini, brought us back a manager, Manuel pellegrini

And

There's something that the wolves want you to know
Best player in the world's from Mexico
Si senor
Pass the ball to Raul and he will score
Number 9
Give Raul the ball he'll score every time
"He's French..he's free.. he'll break your fucking knee.."
I know we're so lame over here. I was at the Pittsburgh Penguins game the year after they beat Nashville to win the Stanley Cup and I got my section to start chanting.."You'll never say that, you'll never say that, Stanley Cup Champions you'll never say that!" We got told to shush. People were looking at us like we were from another planet. I guess we're just used to chanting whatever the jumbotron tells us to. Lame.

Marching On Together gives me chills.
Newcastle fan:

Geordie boys, were on a bender.

Cristiano's a sex offender.
1-0 down, 4-1 up, Albert luque wrapped it up!!
I always found it amusing that David Beckham was always being asked in chants at opposing grounds on whether Victoria took anal.
The objective answer to this is ‚ÄúWill Grigg‚Äôs on fire‚Äù
His neck scars prove he's lost his head, tevez tevez

He always shags an ugly bird tevez, tevez

the angry twat, the ugly cunt, they've sewn his head on back to front 

Carlos Tezez, Hermen Munster Head
Celtic fans used to sing "There is only two Andy Goram" when he turned out to be schizophrenic. Andy Goram was an absolute prick that supported Protestant paramilitary groups in the North.
He‚Äôs here he‚Äôs there he‚Äôs every fucking where 
Roy Kent! Roy Kent! 
üòâ
I can't remember the team but there was a Scottish team whose fans sang what their team was doing

We've got the ball, we've got the ball, we've lost the ball, we've lost the ball, they've got the ball .. etc, etc
Geordie boys on a bender.
Cristiano- sex offender
To the tune of Waka Waka - Shakira

Neville Neville is the name of your dad
There's the Saliba chant that's just taken off, but I like the one to the Monkees song.

And then I saw his pace,
It's William Saliba!
Auchinleck Talbot have a chant of "Eeka, Peeka, Pukka, Po" that apparently came from them hearing a deaf guy trying to sing "We'll support you evermore."
What‚Äôs that coming over the Hill 

Pascal Chimbonda! Pascal Chimbonda!

(To the tune of Monster by The Automatic)
My personal favourite chant is singing Ivanovic to the tune of the mah na mah na song from sesame Street.

It would start with one bloke shouting "Ivanovic" then everyone joins in with do doo do do do, ending with Chelsea's number 2. 

Pregnant pause until someone else pipes up with IVANOVIC! Rinse and repeat.
Some excellent songs from the Toon fans here - https://youtu.be/kdeLlhA103I
To the tune by manic street preachers, about graham Rix being a nonce. ‚ÄúOh if you tolerate Rix then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, willllll be neeext‚Äù
Adam Johnson pedophile!
The Yaya Kolo Toure song was amazing. Still cracks me up
Y‚Äôall are posting songs I want to sing along to but please tell me to what tune!!
Republic of Ireland fans to their Swedish counterparts ‚Äúgo home, to you sexy wives‚Äù to the tune of go west.
Big fucking German! We‚Äôve got a big fucking german! Big fuckinggg Geeeermannn, we‚Äôve got a big fucking Germannnn.

Per Mertesacker, what a man!
Mesut Ozils eyes being offsides
I like the ‚Äúwe lose every week‚Äù. Also there was a terrible one I heard Emmanuel Adebayor receive one time. Terrible but it might‚Äôve made me lol..
Your wife is a grass

Your wife is a grassss

Jamie Vardy

Your wife is a grassüëåüèª
As a football fan and a fan of PL (I'm portuguese) one of the chants i like the most and keep in my mid through the years was the Republic Ireland (if I'm not confused) in Euro2016

Will Grig's is on fire
Your defense is terrified
(...)

It was an amazing chant. Not just de lyrics but all the things that exist around the chant. Will Grig's goals, the happiness, all people jumping and chanting, people hugging anyone while chant. It was just magic!
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got Knockaert
Anthony Knockaert, just don‚Äôt think you understand
Only cost 1 mil
Better then Ozil
We‚Äôve got Anthony Knockaert‚Äù
One of my favourite players to ever play for Brighton
Heard  being sung by Newcastle fans when Peter Reid was managing Sunderland: ‚ÄúPeter Reid‚Äôs got a fuckin‚Äô monkey‚Äôs heid‚Äù. Which he has, to be quite honest.

Another top chant was for Vieta at Arsenal ( to the tune of ‚ÄòVolare‚Äô):
Viera, ooo-ooo, Viera
He comes from Se-ne-gal
He plays for Ar-sen-al
Viera, ooo-ooo Viera etc.
He‚Äôs our keeper

our belgian keeper

He‚Äôs simon mignolet

A mignolet a mignolet a mignolet a mignolet
The Saliba one from this past weekend was a cracker tbf
‚ÄúStop Crying Frank Lampard‚Äù was an absolute master stroke from our fans, even if it only lasted a week. üò¨
Weat Ham beating Man Utd at Upton Park in PL mid 00s.
They were neck and neck with Chelsea (I believe) and the season was wobbling.

"Fuck all! You're gonna win Fuck all, you're gonna win fuck all!"

Man Utd fans without missing a beat return with:

"You *NEVER* win fuck all! You *never* win fuck all!"
"FUCK ALL"


Touch√© 
Touch√©
‚ÄúPAARK PAARK WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, YOU EAT DOGS IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY, COULD BE WORSE, COULD BE SCOUSE, EATING RATS IN YOUR COUCIL HOUSE‚Äù

As a scouser, this one constantly makes me chuckle strangely
The irish one for James McClean to the tune of when Johnny comes marching home

He wouldn't sing God save the Queen McClean McClean 

He told the North go fuck yourself McClean McClean 

And now he plays for the boys in green and now he sings Amhar√†n na bhFiann 

James McClean hates the fucking Queen

He turned his back against the flag McClean McClean 

He called the Queen a fucking slag McClean McClean 

He hates the poppy. he hates the brits. he hates the North. there fucking shit

James McLean hates the fucking Queen 

Your shit  but your wife's are fit. to the Swedish supporters also gave me a chuckle
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got no hair but we don‚Äôt care, Steve Stone‚Ä¶. Steve Stone.  ‚Äú.  Going back to the old Forest days

"The shit from Spurs, they bought his flight!
But Willian, he saw the light!
He got a call from Abramovich,
And off he went tk Stamford Bridge!
He hates Tottenham!
He hates Tottenham!
He hates Tottenham oh he hates Tottenham!"

Not sure if already posted but one of my absolutely favourites
We lose every week
We lose every weeeek
You're nothing special 
We lose every week.
Andy Goram was playing for Motherwell when the newspaper suggested that he was possibly suffering from schizophrenia.  

Next week the crowd chanted:

"There's only two Andy Gorams, two Andy Gorams, there's only two Andy Gorams!"
Wolves chant for Hwang Hee-Chan last season is an all-timer for me. https://youtu.be/0baLdWB72sc

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Korean,
Only on loan for a season,
We think he‚Äôs fucking brilliant,
Hes Hwang Hee-Chan‚Äù
Cheer up Peter Reid, you‚Äôve got a monkeys heed..

Or fuck off adam Johnson, you‚Äôre going down for noncing.

Basically any that take the piss out the mackems
How did no one mention Sunderland fans singing: "We want our Dick back"?

Edit: YEEEEEES someone said it!
Fun fact: in the same game, they actually had a huge inflated penis!
And for baseball we are programmed to clap along or finish specific sound bits played over the speaker.  :|
Gimme gimme gimme a ginger from Sweden is my most recent fave
Kulusevski‚Äôs ginger from Sweden chant is class
Singing Saliba chant for 90 mins must be fun
Every goalkeeper kick... "oooooooooo" *kicks ball* "you're shitttttt... ahhhhhhhh"
FIGHT


AND WIN
...
...

COME ON
SEATTLE!
What do we think of tottenham? Shit! 
What do we think of shit? Tottenham! 
We hate tottenham and we hate tottenham‚Ä¶
Always liked, 
Shoes off if you hate Man U,
Shows off if you hate Man U.

Remember playing Man City in the cup under the warnock era (season) and both set of fans singing this ahha brilliant
I know that this is only a joke, but Edward Elgar was a keen Wolves supporter and even [composed a chant for a Scottish striker in the 1890s! ](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/edward-elgar/he-banged-the-leather-for-goal)
Ohhhhh adam johnson
You're going down for noncing
You're a peeeeedophile 
You're a peeeeedophile 
 
Always a funny one Sunderland get sung at themüòÇ
When Wolves last got relegated from the Premier League: 

"Qu√© ser√°, ser√°, whatever will be, will be, we're going to Barnsley, qu√© ser√°, ser√°" 

A year on, we then got relegated from the championship: 

"Qu√© ser√°, ser√°, whatever will be, will be, we're going to Shrewsbury, qu√© ser√°, ser√°"
Does the circus know you‚Äôre hereeee!?

Directed at Peter Crouch because he is lanky and a little freakish looking (good geezer though)
Your father is your brother, your sister is your mother, you all fuck one another, a kiddie family.

edit: goes along with the adams family theme
How do I save a reddit thread to keep for all time? 

Love this and I agree with the OP. Love just reading these.
Take me home, United road,
To a place that I belong,
To Old Trafford, to see United,
Take me home, United road...

Heard this and was astonished.
To Man U fans at home 'You only live round the corner, live round the cooorner!'. Man U away: 'We'll race you back to London!'
The best chants in football i ever heard are all from north africa specially algeria, Morocco and Tunisia that can put any other chants to shame

[the second one is from KAC K√©nitra (the only one i found with decent translation, there are other much better)](https://youtu.be/vkbrTSNdOVA)
The best by a long long way in recent years has to be the Leeds fans to Frank when he was Derby manager. After the Bielsa spying rumours they came up with this belter to the tune of Stop Crying Your Heart Out:

‚ÄúNow all of the spies, are hidden away, just try not to worry, you‚Äôll beat us someday, we beat you at home, we‚Äôll beat you away so stop crying Frank Lampard‚Äù
So many good lfc ones we used to sing back in the day. Here's a taste. 

Don't know what the tune is called, the great escape or something. 

Oh Gary Neville, he f***s his mother, that's why he's got an ugly brother. Oh Gary Neville he f***s his mother. Da da da da da da da...
Oh Phillip Neville, he f***s his mother, that's why he's got an ugly brother... Etc. 

To the tune of carefree wherever you may be... 

Dirk Kuyt as good as he may be, hit every branch on the ugly tree, but it could be worse, he could be a manc, looking at his ma while he's having a w***

To the lion sleeps tonight 
He's a keeper, a Belgian keeper it's Simon mingolet. A mingolet, a mingolet, a mingolet, a mingolet....

There's so many more but that's the top of my head
Me: What do we think of Tottenham?

Fans: SHIT!

Me: What do we think of shit? 

Fans: TOTENHAM! 

Me: Thank you

Fans: THAT'S ALRIGHT!

Everybody: WE HATE TOTTENHAM, WE HATE TOTTENHAM. WE HATE TOTTENHAM, WE HATE TOTTENHAM.
‚ÄúYou bought the wrong Ronaldo‚Äù

A chant that belongs in r/agedlikemilk by Chelsea fans at Old Trafford to new signing teenaged Ronaldo.
"You're shit, but your birds are fit" -england fans to sweden fans
Recency bias, but the Saliba/Tequila chant was hilarious. Partly because of how long it went on.
Romaluuuuu lukakuuuuu

He‚Äôs our Belgian scoring genius 

With a 24 inch penis 

Scoring all our goalsssss

Bell end by his toes
Park park wherever you may be

You eat dogs in your home country

It could be worse, you could be scouse

Eating rats in your council house
The worst one i know of was in Spanish for Ruben Castro when he was at Betis. He was alleged to have committed domestic violence against his wife and the song went "no fue tu culpa, era una a puta, lo hiciste bien." 

You can plug it into Google translate to see just how bad it was. I think they team got into some trouble because the fans kept singing it
He comes from the Ivory Coast, Kalou, Kalou,
He don't do coke like Adrian Mutu, Mutu,
He crossed the ball from the left,
It landed right on Riise's head,
That's why we love Salomon Kalou,
La la la la la la la la la...

Context . Chelsea player mutu got caught taking coke
A bit back-in-the-day but I loved the song for Emmanuel Petit

He‚Äôs fast, he‚Äôs quick, his names a porno flick,
Emmanuel, Emmanuel‚Ä¶
Had fun with the Maguire song at the Euros

Harry Maguire

HARRY MAGUIRE!

he drinks the vodka

He drinks the Jaeger 

His heads fucking massive
Oh and his name is carlton palmer, and he smokes marijuana, walking along, smoking a bong, lost in his own wonderland
Your uncle is your brother 

Your sister is your mother

You all fuck each other

Some fairly creative stuff here - on the very few times I got dragged to matches when I were young, all I remember apart from the backs of the people in front of me was "You're going home in a fuckin' ambulance!" and "You're gonna get your fuckin' 'ed kicked in!"

Was never into football, but I learned expletives at a very young age.
OOOOOOHHHHH ROMELU LUKAKUUUUUUUU

Yall know the rest
When Freddy Ljunberg dyed his hair red and started scoring goals: (Hope I‚Äôve got this right):

We love you Freddy
‚ÄòCause you‚Äôve got red hair 
We love you Fre-ddy
‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre always here 
We love you Freddy
‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre Arsenal through and true 

To the tune of ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt take my eyes off of you‚Äô by Frankie Valley among others.
Your auntie is mother
Your father is your brother 
You all fuck one another 
The Norwich family!
"Leighton Baines, you probably think this song is about you, don't you?"
When Rangers goalie Andy Goram was diagnosed with schizophrenia the Celtic fans sang ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only 2 Andy Goram‚Äôs‚Äù
I watch Rotherham United occasionally because I live there.
So I'm sat next to the away supporters who were Burnley, they had a great following and were very vocal
The Burnley fans start singing " Sit down if you're a paedophile" 
I was the only person to stand up in reply to this, which was greeted with a big laugh and cheer from them, so I waved and bowed back to them üëç
After infamous Rangers goalie Andy Goram was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Celtic FC fans started singing ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only two Andy Gorams‚Äù. Because Glasgow.
I don't particularly care for American chants. More obnoxious than anything, but I'll still support teams by going to games.
"Mik Arteta called him

Said nows your time to shine

Oh I believe in Jesus

The Arsenal number nine"


Class chant this one from the Gooners
just attended my first Premier League at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and they have a hilarious chant for Dejan Kulusevski to the tune of Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba. 
‚ÄúGimme Gimme Gimme a ginger from Sweden, his name is Kulusevski and he plays on the wing‚Äù I forget the other verses though lol


They also had one for new signing Yves Bissouma. it‚Äôs just the tequila song, but instead of tequila everyone yells Bissouma!
"arsenal get battered everywhere they go"
It‚Äôs obviously:

Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea
Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea
We believe!
We believe that we can win!

Not strictly premier league, but our favourite last season was after the playoff semi final 

"Warnock said that Spence was shite,
now he's fucking dynamite"

And in the playoff final 

"If Yatesy scores, we're in the Trent"- which I suspect become a regular one at home once Ryan Yates, a home grown lad, is fit and playing
Misogynistic (as most of the 90s were! :-( ) but: "Post Spice is a slapper, she wears a wonder bra, when she's shagging Beckham, she thinks of Ginola!"
Americans: DEFENSE, DEFENSE

Whenever someone plays at Brighton (LQBTQ capital of England) there‚Äôs a chant that‚Äôs simply 
‚ÄúWe can see you holding hands‚Äù
My favourite United one is this one to the tune of My old man said follow the van :

My old man, said be a City fan

And I said bollocks, you're a cunt (YOU'RE A CUNT)

I'd rather shag a bucket with a big hole in it

Than be a City fan for just one minute 

With hatchets and hammers, Stanley knives and spanners

We'll show those City bastards how to fight (HOW TO FIGHT)

Oh I'd rather shag a bucket with a big hole in it

With a bag of sweets, and a cheeky smile, Wenger is a fucking pedophile.

I liked the counting song they were singing for ten hagg
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TOTTENHAM
Loved it when Ji-Sung park was playing for United:

You eat dogs in your own country

It could be worse

You could be scouse

Eating rats in your council house.

And my favourite Viva Gareth Bale
I‚Äôm no Liverpool fan, but that ‚ÄúSugar Sugar‚Äù parody from a few years back was catchy as fuck
I read two on Facebook that I wish I had heard live:

John Carew, Carew
He will score a goal or two
He might even pay for you
John Carew, Carew

I think it was in reference to something that happened in a strip club.


Sing to "Thats Amore":

When the ball hits your head
And you sit in row Z
That's Zamora!
When opposition player is down injured , getting physio sing " dig a hole and bury him " x 50,000 sound funny as they are never badly injured

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the score, hey hey Christian, what‚Äôs the score?‚Äù 

Context: Christian Eriksen was a brentford player who ended up going to Man United. His first game returning to Branford‚Äôs home side was the 4-0 thrashing they gave MU. Initially Brentford fans were booing Eriksen every time he was on the ball but I think they started this song after Brentford scored their second goal.

Don‚Äôt know the full details of this chant as heard it from my dad, but apparently there was a goalkeeper back in the day (can‚Äôt remember his name - let‚Äôs say his names ‚ÄúMike Jones‚Äù) but he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after a long recovery from mental illness he returned to play football‚Ä¶ his first game back, all the away fans sang ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only two Mike Jones, there‚Äôs only two Mike Joneeees!!‚Äù And I feel that sums up British football chants

Refs are downright biased to big 6 clubs, how is this not a foul?

Can you imagine if Newcastle were in the bottom 3 still, and this decision would be very upsetting
Even as a Chelsea fan, we got lucky
Man was dragging him like a disappointed mum dragging her boy out the pub.
It is a foul, but its not bias. the sheer incompetence of Enlgish refs can be seen in virtually every game. The FA really needs a wake up call, because i think the standard or refereeing is not to the standard of the EPL
Chelsea fan here, that‚Äôs a pen all day.
I always try to give refs the benefit of the doubt because it's one of the truly thankless jobs in the world. Having said that the standard of officiating this season has been truly diabolical. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that is a penalty. I could understand the ref not seeing it with the amount of bodies there but how on earth VAR officials could watch him trying to rip Murphys shirt off and not tell the ref to go and have a look at it is beyond me. 

Still very impressed by the lads today. No Joelinton, Willock, Jonjo and our other injuries and we put in a performance that should have got us at least a point. Howay the lads!
It‚Äôs one of the most obvious penalties I‚Äôve seen, do not understand how a ref can see that on VAR and decide it isn‚Äôt a penalty. Just plain incompetence from the refs for the millionth time this season, it‚Äôs getting out of hand now.
Stonewall pen. Mental
Big six supporters will probably hate you for this. What I'll say is there are certainly instances where I feel that has been the case, but there have also been calls that go the other way, even though it is far less frequently than the prior instance. This one, totally a penalty in my book but I could be blind.
In the refs eyes, the jersey is pulling the Chelsea players hand, not the other way around
Cast your mind back 24 hours and remember the red card not given at Brighton. This is a much wider issue than the navel gazing bias mongering people do. It is a systematic damaging of the game by a group of referees and their governing body. I am fully convinced it is a deliberate effort by the refs to get rid of VAR because they hate the very idea of being second guessed, even by their own colleagues.
What makes it worse is he manages about 5 fouls before taking him down.
Well United didn‚Äôt get a penalty yesterday and spurs did for practically the same thing.
And that was 100% penalty for Newcastle, decisions like this are ruining the game
That was 100% a pen. Just came down to the ineptitude of the referee/VAR team.
Arsenal fan here. Certainly not feeling the love from refs. Had some awful decisions against us this season.
Have you seen some of the ridiculous calls Arsenal have not gotten this season?
It's a stonewall pen ngl but why is it when stuff like this happens it becomes a top six bias thing?

Diaz for Liverpool got cleaned out by Brighton keeper yesterday and the keeper didn't even get a yellow.  Bad decisions happen all over.
I feel another apology coming in the morning
Refs and var are absolutely useless
Chelsea fan. We got lucky on that one. Newcastle have been playing great lately, so even a draw would have been good.

But to say the refs are biased to the big 6 is wrong. They are trash for every game, no matter the team.
Stonewall penalty.
The level of bias isn't even subtle anymore. With the amount of replays available. Ans VAR they can't continue to get away with it. Disgraceful
Defo a pen. Shouldn't even need to go to var!
Disgraceful refs
Welcome to what life is like being an Arsenal fan
Yeah I agree, we got lucky here. Newcastle did play well today
I'm a Chelsea fan and have been for nearly 50 years, that was a penalty all day long.
That is outrageous
Yeah that's a penalty
Refereeing today was ABYSMAL
I didn‚Äôt know Maro Itoje played football for Chelsea!
Neutral here. Stonewall penalty.
Explain why Robert Sanchez wasn‚Äôt given a red card for kicking D√≠az.
Turns out Abramovich still has cash in England
I might be biased as an Arsenal fan, but we don't get this big six privilege at all.
You won‚Äôt be calling us big 6 much longer
This is a foul for sure, but these refs were struggling all day. One of many head scratchers both ways in my opinion. But the Magpies have reason for anger here no doubt
:first time meme:
They gave a corner so I guess they believe he knocked the ball out before he went to ground? 

Refs are shit as I've complained about before.
I am a chelsea fan and I was blown away how this was not a pen
This isn‚Äôt bias, the refs in this league are down right atrocious, these calls happen against all teams
Chalobah should have gotten booked. And I say that as a Chelsea fan.
Premier League:
Take your VAR and stick it up your ass, 
with all respect
Disgraceful decision
It was totally foul...
VAR? Fire the ref and give way to someone that wants to do their job...

All for letting the game go, but that shit had to go.
That and diving, yes unrelated but it has to be stopped.
Wow
I see these kinds of fouls gotten away with frequently, regardless of who is playing. I can't remember the last time I saw a penalty given for shirt pulling.
As a Chelsea fan I agree this was a foul, as a complete unbiased football fan I also agree the goal we were disallowed on the league cup was 100% black hand and cost us the trophy...
What in the actual fuck? Why the hell didn‚Äôt the ref call that bullshit? That‚Äôs the equivalent of defensive pass interference *and* a personal foul in American football. He should be setting up for a penalty shot. Next play I‚Äôd be giving that dude an elbow to the chest‚Ä¶. *hard*
That‚Äôs a foul, a pen, a mugging, and dude probably took his wallet and watch too.
Referees and officials really need to be held accountable for these poor decisions. VAR is supposed to stop ridiculous decisions like this but like big al said on MOTD its currently not fit for purpose
Shocking decision. I've actually stopped watching football because of the COMPLETELY ridiculous refereeing decisions. Like that decision earlier in the decision where Ederson completely cleaned out a Newcastle player and he was nowhere near the ball. The red didn't even consider having a look at VAR 

I really do think there's a narrative subplot going on to sell more TV rights and there's an obvious towards the Big 6 because they're richer and have more staying power. Before you call me out, I am a Manchester United fan

I just want fair football man without all the other nonsense
Why PGMOL can't seem to learn anything from World Rugby is beyond me. Every VAR intervention is framed as covering for a refereeing 'error'. Why can't we just accept that officials on the field of play cannot spot everything in real time and just allow VAR to assist them in making key decisions? Drop this "clear and obvious error" nonsense. We just want the acceptable decisions. We don't care about protecting the referee's ego.
I'd agree that was a foul. If you watch every Chelsea game though I don't think you'd agree there's a general bias in our favour lol
100% a pen. 100% a red for the goalscorer. 3 points decided by VAR incompetence.
The ref was woeful the whole game. This was one of many bad calls he made.
No penalty and no red card to Havertz for that elbow on Burn, who was literally bleeding till the end of the game.
Very frustrating watching this today. I also thought Havertz should have been sent off for the blatant elbow to Burns temple. "but you can't jump without your arms in the air" shut up, you can jump without doing that. Rudiger barging Bruno was another ignored foul. Ziyech kicking Bruno in the face. Targett somehow managed to cause a foul while being bundled down to the floor by two players. Just frustrating because Almiron was pulled straight away for a mis-timed clearance which resulted in him kicking someone. Newcastle should have come away with at least a point today. Feel robbed.
But Liverpool pay the refs isn't that right Chelsea fans?

Need to stop agendas and just call it incompetence in general without favouring any specific club.
That's one of the most blatant pens I've seen all season
I would have been smashing the pitch side monitor as to why the ref, did not give it, Also they could be on Payroll from Abramovich
It‚Äôs not a penalty it‚Äôs a big brown envelope
Thats insane
I'd that was Salah it would 100% be a pen
It‚Äôs a foul 100%. If arsenal do this kind of foul, they might at least get yellow card.
The same shit will happen to Chelsea in a few weeks. There's no bias, there's no agenda, it's just incompetence.
Meh, he went down too easy
Just a doubt, the pulling starts outside the box does that mean it should be a foul outside the box? Can that be a reason for not allowing penalty?
Not a Chelsea fan, but this is football, not Tennis. Lil contact wont hurt. Check Serie A, ref would laugh at this incident if a foul was asked.
Big 6 is not accurate. We are second and refs constantly duck us over. E.g yesterday vs Brighton, Diaz got kicked by the goalie and it somehow wasn‚Äôt a red ????????
The refs are shit all around. There‚Äôs no bias towards any side. Every single set of fans on this sub can refer to a time VAR or the refs have fucked them, I‚Äôd bet most of them can recall a time in the last 2 weeks.
You didn't see the missed call for Liverpool yesterday?
David Coote is an all round awful ref. Horrible decisions
Don‚Äôt attribute corruption to incompetence.

Just look at Liverpool yesterday - Diaz gets kicked in the face and not even a booking. 

Everyone gets good and bad calls, teams with more possession and time in attacking penalty box are more likely to look like they get more decisojb
it has nothing to do with VAR and everything to do with a subjective interpretation of the laws that depends too much on precedent and arbitrary contextualization of situations that should in fact be agnostic of context. 

most of these poor calls are technically within the subjective interpretation of the laws.

you have no problem of VAR or the referees.

you have a problem with the rules.

if you want things to be better, the laws need to be codified according to the minute scope that VAR allows us to hone in on.

too often in football these matters are ‚Äúif it looks like a foul it probably is.‚Äù or ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what a foul is, but i know it when i see it.‚Äù
There's no big 6 bias so stop trying to create that agenda. The refs are just as bad for everyone.
Fellow ManUtd supporter here who posted a text post about the same thing lol. Just abhorrent officiating today
As a Chelsea fan I have to admit this is questionable. But in the league cup Keita stamped Chalobah‚Äôs crotch (resulting in six stitches) and not only avoided a card by won a free kick.
u/SaveVideo
This purely foul, every refs on that match should be suspended both the VAR ref
I have no issue with the referee not giving the foul at the time, because from his position it probably looked like strong play from Chalobah, but anyone can see from the replay that it was a penalty. So that‚Äôs when the person in VAR should step in and all they have to say is, please check your monitor for a second review. This way, it gives no bias to change the decision, but is simply allowing the referee to judge again what may be an incorrect call.
David Coote is dog shit end of every game he refs there‚Äôs always 2 or 3 awful decisions given or not given hands down the worst ref in the league.
Eric Dier's handball, No red for Sanchez against Liverpool and this. The quality of referees are waaay below than the quality of football played in PL.
Man I wish the refs were paid...
Seriously need to weed out incompetent refs, even with var they suck.
Just boys being boys
I don‚Äôt think the officials are biased I just think they‚Äôre terrible
Surely it must‚Äôve not been given cos the first offence was outside the box. VAR can only give it if it‚Äôs in the box. 
But if the ref has let it go this long that has to be a pen everyday of the week (Watford fan)
Don't like either team, but fuck me. But there again don't like the cockneys nor mancs
It‚Äôs not refs it‚Äôs the league this is how they want it to be called.  If the league wanted it to change they would change it.  It‚Äôs that simple.
Big six clubs?! Sanchez not getting sent off yesterday is the prime example that it‚Äôs the standard of refereeing in general
Can you point out the times arsenal have benefited from calls?
As a Chelsea fan, watching that in real time and seeing the replay I thought ‚Äúautomatic pen.‚Äù Was pretty shocked it wasn‚Äôt called
Chelsea fan but agree this is a pen. That being said, we've had plenty of bs decisions go against us as well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I think the refs are just massively incompetent. No consistency whatsoever
Esl killed the game the league just openly are corrupt now they literally decide where the clubs finish tbh haha
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bias, it‚Äôs just incompetence. All the teams get fucked over
Tell that to Diaz yesterday lol
Same at Liverpool yesterday with the hand ball in the box and the keeper ( possibly) handling outside the box. What‚Äôs Var for if not to scrutinise these situations?
No foul guys, haven't you heard the new rule???
The shirt has to come completely off for it to be a pen.
Stay educated...
I feel like this year they‚Äôve gotten the most basic things wrong. Last year they way overshot on borderline items. My hope is it‚Äôs just calibration and eventually the standard will be higher, but that hope is not much.
It‚Äôs because the refs know how they will be treated by the fans of the big clubs vs the small ones. Not as much an outrage if he gives the bigger team the benefit of the doubt. Rotten system.
Bias can't be demonstrated with a single incident no matter how egregious.
Coots is such a bad referee. If he doesn‚Äôt get demoted after this season, I‚Äôll be amazed
I totally agree. First Rodri hand ball not given to Everton and now this.
The standard of reffing is awful you see it more because the big 6 are most on the tele and if you aren't a fan you are probably on some level rooting against them so you remember them more too.

Also who even is the big 6 because the top 6 is different every year and just a term the media have made up.

Awful decision today but you see them every week and every fan base gives out about var can't be biased against everyone
Idk if it's bias but definitely shit referee
What‚Äôs the point of VAR?
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre biased. I think they‚Äôre just shite.
I don't think there is a bias they are just woeful
Refs must've accidentally switched up the memo that we're angry at the Russians not Saudis right now.
laughs in arsenal: not all of the big six
I agree it's a pen, but I can kind of see why it wasn't given.

There is no legs clashing and so it's more of a less obvious foul, so VAR didn't overturn the decision.

Again, I agree that's a pen though
These refs has got good amount paid before matches or either they are sooo stupid to understand the fouls.
for some reason these incompetent refs always give the benefit of the doubt to the bigger team, it makes 0 sense of a referee of all people to do that, especially when they have VAR now
Diaz got nearly decapitated yesterday, no card. It‚Äôs not a big 6 bias it‚Äôs just shit refereeing
How was the foul on Diaz not a red card  ?
That is shocking. Some of the decisions this weekend have been awful.
I just got in from the West Ham game and the referee there completely lost control of the game.
There's no will from the PL or the FA to come down on the poor standards of officiating, despite it being the most consistently awful thing about the game. No change or action will ever be taken unless it can be sold as a positive to the refs - empowering them with more tools or the like. Ultimately, flagrantly poor officiating like we saw today just won't be cracked down on- despite the fact that it damages the integrity of the game, and in some cases jeopardises the health of the players.
I was waiting for VAR to reverse it as it was a missed call in the field! We got a rare break from ref
Just a ref who has favs what‚Äôs ur opinion
u/SaveVideo
It's a penalty all day, totally agree there, but I don't think the refs have a bias against any club in particular, I just think that they're shite. Just look at Sanchez taking out Diaz yesterday and not even getting a yellow
Flop
This is the 1 time in years we've gotten the same treatment as liverpool and city. Still it does look like he already decided he was going to go down.
L‚ÄôPool fan here-def pen.
u/savevideobot
WTF‚Ä¶?
Refs these days ignore grabbing of the shirts idk why but they do, that's why Maguire gets away with hugging attackers during corners, but it should be penalized
Itll be your turn soon Newcastle fans, you'll be able to buy the title like the others
It was a bad missed penalty, but to think Chelsea isn‚Äôt screwed PLENTY by incompetence by refereeing is pretty short sighted
Embarrassing for PL.
Idiot fans clapping to that tackle ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Talk less üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Of course.

Otherwise Putin will have them killed.
I actually work as a technical assistant with the VAR, and I can tell you there is non bias. We all have new cars, our loans are paid off, and our kids are going to college for free thanks to anonymous donations, so why would we needn‚Äôt favour any team?
It was an awful decision
So true
Clearly this is a penalty, and no one will argue that Newcastle fans should not feel aggrieved by today‚Äôs refereeing and the result.

THAT SAID‚Ä¶ 


I‚Äôd make some big compilation video of all the times VAR robbed us‚Ä¶ There is no conspiracy attempting to float chelsea results and a metric shit tonne of evidence to show that.


My point here merely adapting Hanlon‚Äôs Razor, ‚ÄúNever attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by terrible English refs‚Äù


How does implementing a VAR system make you fuck it up more frequently than previously? 

By giving shit refs twice as many chances to be incompetent, that‚Äôs how.


A stolen 3 points from an ugly game, but I‚Äôd take it.
The calls these past few months have been terrible.
Pen and a yellow for the shirt pulling
What's the point in VAR
Officiating in football has ruined the game. They reward diving all while punishing those not selling fouls. I feel like there need to be post-game cards handed out. You dive and get a foul, automatic yellow that is carried into your next game. You dive and draw and card or score a goal, automatic red. I actually think carrying cards into the next game is needed to stop diving culture. If you get away with it in game now, there is absolutely no repercussion. If you could push punishments into the next game, AKA you start that game with 10 and not just that player is benched for the game, things would change quickly. Football is being killed by a bunch of fakers.
The north east is FUMING maaaaaaate! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
$$$
What‚Äôs the point of VAR then
If that were in the halfway line ref woulda given a foul why not in the 18yard box?
This is suspiciously similar to watching MLS 'quality' reffing over here on the other side of the Atlantic. Utter garbage.
Premier needs to get refs from outside of England!! It‚Äôs time! This supposed to be the best league and It cant be the best with bullshit refs!! I blind man could see this foul 5 miles away through a straw!
It is interesting that a toe nail over the line is off side, pull a shirt and pull someone over and it is regarded as not enough for a penalty.
The problem with the current state of VAR is that it can only be used to overturn the ref if it is clear and obvious, and not be used as the golden standard. I am willing to bet that the VAR ref said that it was a pen, but because the ref only has to describe what he saw IRL, and if it matches slightly, then it won't be enough to overturn.

The VAR ref should be able to make the correct call even if it isn't "clear and obvious".
There was a red card penalty in the burnley-beentford game for waaayyy less than this
Clearly a foul. But so was the clothes-line on Diaz yesterday - and Brighton‚Äôs keeper went unpunished. So I refute the big 6 thing. Bad refereeing happens.
Big 6? I wish. It's a certain 3 teams + 1 occasionally.
I spoke to a Chelsea fan earlier, he feels hard done by with VAR decisions.

He apparently thinks that Chelsea get unlucky with VAR decisions, and has the usual Chelsea view that the sanctions are unfair because they can‚Äôt go to games
I think it is two fouls
Easy


That's a foul
um excuse me?
The past few years as taught us that refs don‚Äôt need to be good. They just need to show up. They have no accountability so they don‚Äôt worry about mistakes. Ask supporters of any team and this year they have all had calls for and against their team that are atrocious decisions. It sucks for Newcastle fans. But don‚Äôt fret! Everyone gets it. It‚Äôs terrible.
Biased to big six clubs? Nah, they're just consistently bad my friend. United got robbed of a pen yesterday, and got a pen for the same foul against them.
Not even checked by VAR?
It's time that referee decisions are looked into and fines and bans are made
Fucking crooks. 
This the havertz play 


City no pen vs Everton 


Definitely crooking for the big clubs
Complete joke. 0 accountability.
Brighton chelsea and leeds should have red card this week
Not really Ref was just shite.
Yeah I can‚Äôt lie I was very surprised this was a no call. Clearly a pen. Not complaining tho
Soccer is a shit sport BC of this imo. They need to go to the tapes. Everytime. Being able to fake fouls is crap sportsmanship. Getting away with pulling shirts is the same.
Its a fucken joke 
Cost me 550$
Obviously the ref had MORE money on the game
OR he is putin‚Äôright hand man, getting revenge on the sanctions imposed on his boy Abramovicb!
Only explanations i got!üßêüôÉ
PATHETIC
The FA needs to draft in ex-pro‚Äôs to be refs. Ppl say it so often. GET IT DONE YOU USELESS SHITHOUSES!
Newcastle fan - defo a pen and the ref had a shocked today making bad decisions on both sides, but I didn't think Havertz should have been sent off. 

We played well and that's all we can ask for, however many points we get (or don't). In the end it was the quality of world class players that decided an otherwise equal game so fair play to Chelsea. It's good to see them fighting for their lives despite everything the club staff and fans are going through right now!
Chelsea accounts are frozen, we currently can‚Äôt afford to bribe refs
It's got nothing to do with the big 6, it is purely incompetent Refs. Very difficult job but boy they have made some indefensible decisions recently
If this happens to any big six club everyone talks about how **ALL** the refs are bad, and how we need to overhaul how referring is done in England.

If this happens to Man City everyone is gonna be talking about corruption and paying the refs. Its hilarious
thats because all the refs in the PL are trash except one. michael oliver is the only ref i have any confidence in.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bias since there are incompetent decisions in other top six teams games that disadvantage them. This season it has seemed like a major Man City bias but the bias seems to vary from season to season. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs just inconsistent and dreadful officiating that creates the mirage of a bias.
All ball, halal Madrid ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
We just need all the officials sacked and bring in some new refs because that's just bullshit
The refs are just bias against Newcastle since we sued the league for illegally blocking the takeover. 

There has to be a dozen penalty decisions not given or given against unjustly. 

We‚Äôll still buy the league and smash all the big six anyway ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
With the dirty money Newcastle got now, they‚Äôll be a top 6/7 club, don‚Äôt worry. They might replace Chelsea now that Roman is friyooked.
Maybe the foul started outside the box. So if it was it would be a free-kick ?
Damn as a Chelsea fan we‚Äôre lucky the refs suuuuuck, but that was a pen for sure ‚Ä¶.
It's the bookies man. They control everything
I'm a Chelsea fan, that should've been a pen tbh, we got away with one- but considering the bad luck we've had it's nice to see some luck fall our way.
Ignore the big 6 shout. That‚Äôs just blatantly woeful & spineless officiating. If the ref needed help then VAR shows it‚Äôs worth but ducks it. 
What‚Äôs the point of it..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You‚Äôre really saying we get the refs are biased towards us? Do you watch cup finals?
After watching this weekends matches I am convinced the fix is in because there is no way the refs can be this incompetent. I prefer to believe they are all betting on the matches to explain this.
Anywhere outside the box and that‚Äôs a foul
We have all this fantastic foreign talent playing in the premier league, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if the fa brought in the best refs from around the world to officiate?
It looked like a foul until the dude threw himself to the floor.
This is where var need to talk into the refs ear and be like that's a definite foul go have a look. This is the type of situation they literally said it would be used for wtf is going on
The most ridiculous thing about this is they awarded a corner.
Terrible ref and I‚Äôm a Chelsea fan completely ruined the game in my opinion lucky to get the win if I‚Äôm honest could tell the squad was shaken by recent events
Definitely a penalty but to say Coote was bias TOWARDS Chelsea is having a laugh. The man was clearly incompetent all game missing fouls, buying dives and erratic with what he thought was a yellow or not. 

Never mistake for malice what can easily be explained by incompetence.
Easily the worst ref in the PL
Premierships refs are useless, VAR even more so. Definitely a penalty but the same thing would happen at Brentford Vs Norwich.
As a Chelsea fan VAR only checks what the badge of the club the pen is being awarded to is.
Biased towards big 6? You having a laugh? Since when did decisions go Arsenal's way?
lol such a clear penalty. The grabbing of the shirt, not getting a single touch on the ball, penalty all day. I will never understand refereeing standards. It's the most inconsistent thing in the game.
All ball.
the ref today was awful, there were so many fouls that shouldnt have been called and fouls that should have been but werent.
Liverpool has entered the chat. Liverpool disagrees.
Top 6? I take it you didn‚Äôt see the Diaz foul yesterday‚Ä¶
Chelsea fan. Definite penalty. Thought Newcastle were excellent today. Hustled us and didn't let us play. Eddie Howe has done a brilliant job.
Post match interviews with referees where they explain their decisions every game
100% foul
Chelsea being referred to as a ‚ÄòBig 6 Club‚Äô üòÇ
Usually anything that can go against Chelsea will go against Chelsea so I‚Äôm gonna take this as our one off
It‚Äôs not a foul, it was like three.
Foul for sure, poor by ref and useless VAR, but don't think it's just big 4. Louis Diaz almost got killed scoring and keeper did not even get a yellow. How the fuck
Good thing arsenal is not a big 6 club anymore.
to be fair chelsea are in the mud anyway so i think newcastle will get the last laugh
I dont think its a bias or corruption problem. English refs are just shit at their job.
Absolutely that should be a foul. But I don't think it's bias, I think it's incompetence.
Bad decision, yes, but shit decisions happen in all games, top 6 and others. The top 6 just get more attention, do it seems they are getting the to of the dice. Let's not make everything a controversy
There is no conspiracy. David coote is just incompitent
A clear foul. Newcastle was screwed here.
Chelsea fan, fouled him 3 or 4 times before that. This is the shit I hate because it costs managers there jobs and can literally change and affect so much
Chelsea fan here, that ref had a shocking game. Clear PK
As a Chelsea fan..

Made me shake my head. Jesus fuck mate.
Not biased at all. It's just s**t
That‚Äôs a foul but the referee in this game had just terrible terrible officiating across the board. Both teams had just ridiculous no calls tbh.
like a ref can either love you or hate you like liverpool have fucked over quite a few times recently
Definitely a pen. Trash ref today
Duckin rubbish smfh
Even biased to Arsenal? We're in this together brother.
this would be a pen against arsenal
When I saw this live as a chelsea fan I thought for sure it was a penalty, I was literally healing at chalobah through my tv for being so aggressive in the box and then they say corner and I was like what okay makes no sense but ok
We have the worst refs in European football
I am here from /r/all. I watch hockey and that would have been a penalty for sure. Bias is real apparently.
They aren‚Äôt biased towards the top six clubs, Xhaka did pretty much exactly this (but not as bad) against Man City at home and it got them a penalty shot which cost us the game.
How was  Eric dyer handball a no penalty and telles was...?

Refs in PL are blind, corrupt and retarded.
Anyone remember Salah getting a penalty against City, he was supposedly pulled back but threw his arm up and forward and fell forward?  Then you see this and apparently a penalty is just an arbitrary decision.
Well you certainly can‚Äôt make the argument that Chelsea are paying the refs
0
Stonewall Pen, wheres VAR isn't it its job to look for this
Your title is a bit stretched, Sanchez didn‚Äôt get a red card for karate kicking Diaz.
You answered the question in your first part.
I don‚Äôt watch enough matches to comment on fixing or bias toward top 6 but you don‚Äôt even need to watch the sport to see that‚Äôs a fucking foul.
It‚Äôs just as much of a foul as Maguire on Broja a few weeks ago that didn‚Äôt get called. You hit the nail on the head, it‚Äôs all about the big 6 and the money they bring in through exposure. Sad.
Do some refs not have eyes?
not to the big 6 ‚Ä¶they are just shit ‚Ä¶people only notic when it‚Äôs the big 6 because they have more media attention
I wish I could say the refs are bought, but they‚Äôre just plain bad. As a Liverpool fan, even if decisions go our way sometimes, it infuriates me. VAR is used so poorly, the ref will be standing behind a blatant handball and not give it. Zero responsibility, zero action.
Penalty all day
I might be wrong, but that started outside the box so never a pen, also bc it‚Äôs outside the box no var?
Even the Chelsea players look like they're calling for a foul lol
This shit happens all the time in soccer. If the ref cant see, expect this shit.  


One time I ran past a goalie then did a loop behind him in the net (instead of crashing into the net at mach 10). He elbowed me in the face when I came around.
Horrendous call. The premier league needs to take more accountability with its officiating. They‚Äôre basically a small mafia.
The bias in favor of the ‚Äùbig six‚Äù from officials and commentators is the greatest ongoing disgrace for the Premier League. The fact that they feel entitled to this bias and whine endlessly on the rare occasions that they don‚Äôt have things their way is the second biggest disgrace.
Only chelsea tbf
They are.probably paid
Pen through and through, we got so lucky, have no idea what Trev was thinking there
just a bad officiating. nothing such a bias here especially after the whole country has thrown chelsea under the bus this week
They want riots and fights to happen in other parts of the world instead of just Mexico recently
I credit the player for fighting and trying to still get to the ball.

But this is why people dive. They don't get rewarded for fighting through a foul, and often the foul just doesn't get called. Its fucking ridiculous
[duckbet](https://duckkub.com/)
Now no one can say chelsea bought the game anymore.
It‚Äôs every weekend. The state of officiating is so bad it made you wonder if they are in the take.
My only thought is that the initial foul was outside the box, so therefore VAR can not rule on a foul when the ref didn't call any. So yes the ref my have missed the shirt pull (depending on angle) but VAR would definitely see it... however if they deemed the initial foul started outside the box they can't award anything, even a foul.

The ref would have had to call a foul or a pen for VAR to clear up where the foul started, but if deemed outside the box then can't award a pen (and VAR can't award fouls that the ref doesnt initially call outside the box).
Even worse, an afternoon of sloppy defending, late challenges and a couple of penalty shouts - given King of the Match.

How did he earn that?
u/downloadvideo
u/savevideo
Honestly I see how the ref may have seen that as clean from certain angles
Yes its foul, but i dont care jajaja
What the fuck is that!!
It is a foul. 

Fuck Chelshit!
That‚Äôs unreal üòÖ
as i was watching the match, i thought "oh, fuck, that's a pen"
The refs were bought and paid for a long time ago
They didnt want him to cause a penalty 2 games in row is my guess.
Refs have lost the plot. Villa game saw a Hammers player kick Luiz in the head with a high boot and got away with it.
Sanchez was lucky not to get a red card vs Liverpool. Incompetence everywhere
üíÄ
Bias to big 6 clubs? Did you see Sanchez's fly leg closeline on Diaz?? Not even a warning!! Refereeing in England is a fucking joke and VAR isn't fit for purpose.
Lol I haven‚Äôt seen Liverpool get a lucky call for years now. What bias are you talking about
I don't know if the VAR is useful now
Sorry biased? Try supporting Arsenal we never get the right calls - City and Liverpool seem too maybe some others Refs are just shit and VAR seemingly useless
Why didn't they ask the ref to take a look?
I was furious at the time being a geordie,  now I'm just grateful that we didn't really need any points thanks to the teams efforts last month. Chelsea , be warned it could be a long time before you beat us again ! I hope so as well as our record against you is shocking haha
Nah, it's not a pen from the first camera it looks like foul, but from the back camera you can see how minimal is the contact, and Murpy tried to look for that contact. Also that look how he slipped down, if you get fouled from that type of position, trust me you won't fall sideways. Hate me or not i cannot see foul there. And No i'm not a Chelsea fan .
They'll call the manager and players in private and apologize. Retards
It‚Äôs not a foul. If you look closely at the second angle, you can clearly the defender plays for Chelsea.
Completely different game if thats given and we score the resulting penalty, but aside from that VAR also missed the fact it wasn't even a corner, it comes off Murphy before going out so I dont know what they're doing up in the little booth but its clearly not watching the replays.
Out of the big 6 I'd say Chelsea suffer more from bad refereeing
Mane on Azpi was a red card as well. For once the blues got a lucky decision
Tbf I think refs are just pretty shit across the board
It's totally a foul. But you know what? I've seen a bunch of obvious fouls on big 6 teams not get called too over the past couple seasons. The refs in general are just bad.
I think because he flicked his body at the end of the foul led to it not being given since that would be deemed as simulation. I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt consider all that happened before. I‚Äôd like to see the foul given as well as the simulator booked in some situations (not this one necessarily) or the refs could maybe give the odd foul with the player not having to go to ground in order to get it. This just encourages what we just saw.
yes the refs deeeeefinitely help arsenal
Abrahamovich‚Äôs money at work.
Just like the handball City got away with at Everton. VAR see‚Äôs what it wants to see.
TBH I don't think it's bias, I think it's pure incompetence. Which personally I think is worse.
I don‚Äôt even Think it‚Äôs to the Big 6. The refs are generally incompetent
Even the announcers commentary was bullshit.
This would definitely be given against Arsenal 100%

Even took ages to award penalty for a clear handball again Leicester City
‚ÄúSports governing body is biased‚Äù is such a room temperature IQ take
I‚Äôm a chelsea fan and while they were reviewing it I thought it was a stonewall pen. If that was against us I would be fuming! What the duck are the VAR guys doing
One of the best Premier league team goal of the Least Decade.Aaron Ramsey goal vs Fullham

Passed it round them like they weren‚Äôt there, such a goal
Love this goal with all my heart
Arsenal and beautiful team goals better love story than twilight
That backheel from Bellerin to Ramsey was so filthy.
That pass by Mkhitaryan to Auba is underrated. He could‚Äôve decided to slow the game there but he just released the ball first time in beautiful fashion.
Who died after this beauty?
Manbun Bellerin was a force
Bar the first, every single one of Ramsey's touches in that move is undiluted fuckery of the highest order. None of them would go that well again, yet all of them were successful. Absolute magic.
Ah, people ask me why are you an Arsenal fan. You've not won anything big except FA cups and such for so long. I tell them: have you watched them play?
That‚Äôs the problem with arsenal. They always try to walk it in.
the non-chalant celebration gets me every time haha
I‚Äôve always said this is the best team goal I‚Äôve ever seen in the Premier League. Better than Wilshere vs Norwich imo
Is it crazy that I prefer Aubameyangs vs Leicester to this one
City is immaculate. Barcelona was immaculate. Every pass is measured and executed to perfection.
This Arsenal goal was improvised and innovative. The airborne balls could have been lost if not for a healthy dose of luck as well.
You love to see it
Football at it's best! Insane goal
The through ball from Mkhitaryan to set up Auba‚Äôs pass is so nice
You'll never sing that
To think this isn't even there best team goal of that decade is crazy. Wilshire v norwhich will always hold a place in my heart as the best team goal in prem history. That pass to aubameyang out wide was so satisfying I remember the match and I was so angry but also in awe. The one against Leicester was amazing too
It's really good. A few dodgy passes that worked out, but that's how it goes sometimes
I‚Äôm frothing at every hole
this is brilliant
As a Man Utd fan, I accept them as possible champions this year. This was fun and skillful.
what a player.
Arsenal really do be playing like Barcelona against Fulham, Leeds, & Norwich.
Masterclass goal. But I have to ask: did the curse take hold after this goal?
This goal killed Eric Bristow
This build up was so chaotic that Fulham had no idea how to contain it
These guys sure do know how to handle there balls.
Wilshire against Norwich is clear of this‚Ä¶

Berbatov‚Äôs counter where he picked up the ball deep aswell is clear of this‚Ä¶if you know you know
Good ebening masterclass üòé
NSFW this thing, because that was pure filth.
So... Who died that week?
Istg Arsenal own more than half of the most iconic premier league goals there are
Who died after this Aaron Ramsey goal?
The buildup to this goal and the grit to get the ball up the field was lovely to watch. Great finish at the end.
I remember this game like it was yesterday. Fulham 1-5 arsenal one of the gunners best away performances
I love this goal because the finish was exquisite, but it wasn't nearly as technically elite as the Norwich goal or ozils dummy goal. There were a few points in this where it could have broken down because of touches and passes. Still an amazing goal, but not nearly as smooth as others we've put in across the years.
I like the other one too ‚Ä¶ the one where rosicky et al. Just walk the ball into the net.
will say that auba team goals against Leicester Is better
This lad has been so underrated by so many.
Tekkers
Best part: sideline marquee reading ‚ÄúFootball with flair‚Äù
I read this as ‚ÄúAaron Ramsdale goal‚Äù and I was so confused.
Absolutely brilliant
What‚Äôs the least decade?
It was actually well defended, which makes it even more amazing.
Arsenal was a great squad back then but now I dont know what happened to them
Don‚Äôt play soccer but this is how I imagine my team looks whenever I have the ball in fifa
I suppose the goal was somewhat decent.
The thing about Arsenal
‚ÄúThe thing about Arsenal is‚Ä¶‚Äù
Arsenal-esqueüî•
I swear arsenal have an amazing team goal every season or two that is absolutely insane
Mkhitaryan‚Äôs pass in this is soooo underrated
This one and the Wilshire Goal against Norwich are probably my favorite Arsenal goals. Because they were all team goals. Just beautifully done.
It was the least decade of them all.
This is my favorite: Peter Crouch. The ball doesn‚Äôt touch the ground until it‚Äôs in the back of the net.

You'd think our 2010s team was Prem Barca if you only watched the highlights of it lol
Who died?
Who died ü§î as a result of this fantastic goal?
suuuuuu
This is a very nice goal.
*sigh* who was it this time
Emery ball ?
this is all what wenger wants
Wish he stayed ‚ù§Ô∏è
God damn
Unpopular opinion: I don‚Äôt like this goal
 u/savevideo
rodri‚Äôs everton goal
Ramsey is not the most talented footbal player, but he is my favourite. Miss him so much.
The trouble with arsenal is they always try to walk it in
My guys!
I wonder which celebrity died the next day
Giroud scorpion kick goal against crystal palace is also up there with the best premier league goal of the decade tbh
There was a run of games where Ramsey became the best player in EPL. It's a shame he hadn't lived upto his potential.
Why always Arsenal do a incredibles teams goals?
All this from aasna and no PL, no CL. 20 years since a major trophy

Aubamabloodclaartyang ü§°ü§°ü§°
I prefer the Jack Wilshire one
Well dwane Johnsons dead
This is maybe what Arsenal does best. If we are going to host a Team Goal Convention. ARSENAL FC is the Keynote Speaker. This Goal, Wilshire's Goal, and Giroud's Scorpion finish:  Ils Sont Magnifiques ü§å
Did he come off at 60 minutes?
Pity he couldn't put away a simple penalty üëÄ
Glass ankles
Meh
Would love to see the Most Decade
Looks like a celebrity is dying
Shame he‚Äôs shite at penalties. Not really, fuck rangers
Pile of shit!!!
How is it that arsenal score these type of goals but are so bad.
Manchester united vs Sheffield into the chat
Mate. Stop please. You are truly embarrassing yourself.
Typical wenger goal, cant believe arsenal fans wanted him gone. They deserve all they are going through now
