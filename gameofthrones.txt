[No Spoilers] Peter Dinklage showed the world that little people don't need to be relegated to the background or cast as anything less than traditional roles. He absolutely crushed his performance, and may have helped other talented little people to get a bigger chance in film and television.

“Remember what you are. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.”
YES! Speaking as an individual with achondroplasia (Peter Dinklage’s form of dwarfism, which is the most common type), he has been wonderful, FANTASTIC, for LP (Little People) representation in our society. If nothing else, having ppl reference his roles in GoT or XMen, Station Agent, etc. when talking about dwarfism instead of “Little Women of LA” or other reality shows is a huge step up in the dignity factor. 
I am positive that he has helped LPs [to not be viewed as mentally incapacitated, incompetent, or immature] in the show-business as well as just any business world. One of the most damaging stereotypes that comes with the dwarf caricature is the infantilization (ex: oh how freakishly cute but utterly deaf, dumb & incapable). 

Tyrion & Trask run empires. They make mistakes (like any average person), but they got there in the first place & that is so powerful....god, just how articulate Peter Dinklage is is great for the LP image. Can’t agree with OP (or at least hope that OP turns out to be right) more.
Ever see him in that Steve busecmi movie “Living in Oblivion”?
He was the heart of the show.
He did a great job but it wasn’t a traditional role. The character was written as being a little person.
[removed]
Be thankful that GRRM created that character in the books being a complex and intelligent character. If some Hollywood bozo's would've come up with him it would've most likely be a joke of a character. Or they wouldn't even have come up with him.
Doesn’t hurt that he’s stupid handsome and has incredible acting chops. 

Also his character in GoT a dwarf.
Like everyone, I noticed his size right away.  No different than noticing Joffrey's blonde hair or Margery's cleavage.  But his acting was so powerful and engaging that his physical attributes disappeared.  Peter Dinklage is one of the best actors of our generation and easily the best character on GOT.
For someone who clearly didn't like the last season, he acted his ass off in those last episodes
As Varys once said 'a small man can cast a very large shadow' Peter did an amazing job playing Tyrion, given the shit writing and the dumbing down of his character, the acting was still awesome
Tyrion was the best character on the show.
[deleted]
I'll say what we are all thinkin; "Remake Willow with Pete dinklege!!"
Warwick Davis in Willow.  The world wasn't ready..
Taking nothing away from the stellar, stallar Dinklage, most of the credit goes to creator of the character GRRM here.
Fuck yeah. As far as I'm concerned, GoT was "The Tyrion Show." there were many good performances all around, but he crushed it.

And to the poster who said the character was already a little person, I agree, but Dinklage showed he can give a commanding performance. And the next time you see him in a major dramatic role, you'll spend less time thinking "Hey, he's a pretty good actor for a little person."
[removed]
He was one of the best actors in the entire show. His trial is to this day my favorite chapter in the show. And of course Tyrion is my favorite character in the show.
And GRRM showed the world how to do inclusion without it feeling forced. A perfect storm :)
The dude has been a powerhouse for over 10 years, glad he’s getting the respect he’s due.
[deleted]
He already proved this with The Station Agent.
May his reign be long.
He owned the show with his performance and that’s with a ridiculous amount of great characters played by great actors and actresses
Warwick Davis says hi, OP.
He's being doing that his whole career. Loved him in Death at a Funeral.
Have you seen Tiptoes? Truly another of his great performances.
Dinklage certainly nailed it and was one of the stars if the series, but the role was written with dwarfism in mind. Tyrion was frequently laughed at and dismissed his entire life due to his stature and that molded his character. It rung true to have a dwarf play that.

If Dinklage has been cast to play Jaime then it would have been ridiculous. He could not credibly play a dashing knight known as one of the best fighters in the land in a world full of normal sized people.

You can’t just drop any actor in any role, but you can write good stories and characters for actors of all shapes/sizes/colors/genders/whatever.
No SHIT!. ...Literally one of my favorite actors now. I'm not going to bullshit and say....he's such a good actor I don't even notice he's short. I see him , I see he's a ( I honestly don't know the PC term) dwarf? Little person? It doesn't matter i  just know I get excited because I'm about to see some goddamn great acting. No different than seeing an old actor like Clint Eastwood. I know he's old , I don't care because I'm about to see some good ass acting. Or a heavy person or a female etc. Stop the nonsense of pretending that we should see Peter as a full stature person and accept that he's a dwarf but can act with literally....the best of them
Regardless of anything. 

He showed one of the biggest performances. Amazing work.
I agree with your statement that he crushed his performance and is an amazing actor... But saying he was cast in a traditional role or the world is ready is false optimism and/or unrealistic. Peter Dinklage was cast as a little person to play the imp a literal little person. GRM wrote an amazing character but Tyrion being a little person that proved he is capable and the best of the Lannister children in lieu of his fate is the whole premise of the story arc. When Peter Dinklage gets cast into a role solely based on his acting chops then you can say Hollywood or the world is ready to cast little people into traditional roles. (And I hope Mr. Dinklage gets that chance because he is outstanding and deserves it.)

Edited for clarification
He’s also the guy who convinced Lena to play Cersei. For that alone he deserves our thanks.
This post is pretty pointless, but I guess that’s to be expected now that the shows over, time to unsub
What’s the point of posts like this?
Am I the only one that thinks this is a bit silly. 

He was picked specifically because he's a little person.

The only roles I can think of him being in hes specifically picked for these reasons.

Game of thrones to play the imp.
Elf so Will Ferrell can call him an elf.
30 rock because Liz Lemon confuses him for a child.

I think the only role I know him in where his littleness is not exactly alluded to is Seinfeld when hes sexy voice phone guy.
 
Am I missing something?

Ps hes a wonderful actor and I'd love to see him in more roles.

Nobody: ........                                                                     
Random people on reddit: LITTLE PEOPLE CAN ALSO ACT GREAT
Should this subreddit just be renamed Game of Thrones Circle Jerk?

The karma whoring/farming just seems like a joke at this point.
Peter Dinklage slayed the finale.  I dub him the finaleslayer.

However, I think it’s sad little people are usually only casted in little people roles.  If Tyrion wasn’t suppose to be a dwarf I don’t think they’d cast him as any other character like a Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister type of role
Real talk. A lot of people and progressives talk about how there isn't enough representation of minorities in media, but they're usually just refering to non-whites and women; but what I never hear them talk about are people with physical disabilities or mutations, such as little people, actual albinos that aren't evil, etc.
Karma whores are obnoxious.
[Spoilers] How transportation in GOT actually works

Jon tried using this feature while north of the wall. “Cannot fast travel while in combat...” 

/whisper Daenerys “hayyy, wanna run a dungeon with me? Can’t summon you though, you gonna have to fly here.”
I would love a true open world thrones rpg
I have no issue with being reposted but why you needed to download it and then reupload it in god awful quality I don't know. Anyone wants to see the version where you don't have cataracts [it's here](https://i.imgur.com/lL2Gyf0.gifv)
Stolen from u/elpinko
If only he had pressed "Save", maybe he would still be alive...
Are you not going to give credits to OP u/elpinko?
I love watching the first episode where Robert tells Ned it took them a month to travel from KL to WF. HA!
I loved this the first time it was posted. Nice steal op
Give the original poster some credit man
Less than 24 hours before a repost?
Now I want an open world GoT game
A stolen repost in worse quality that makes it to the front page. 

brutal
>The gaming mods are cucks

A powerful spell
This is a repost*
Now I really need a GoT rpg
To be fair it was established in season 1 or 2 that you could travel much faster by boat than on land. Was still a little too fast the last couple seasons though (plus Gendry's running which was a major wtf).

edit: fixed Pod/Gendry mixup.
Also works for any season 7 episode.
How quickly people forget season 1....  
Cately Stark traveled just as fast in season 1:

 \- episode 2 - In Winterfell, episode 3 - In Kings Landing 

So compare with season 8:

 \- Theon near KL (not sure) in episode 1, episode 2 in Winterfell.
Gendry in season 7:

*You can not fast travel while enemies are nearby, You can not fast travel while enemies are nearby, You can not fast travel whi...*
I figured this was how it worked.
I’ve never understood why people think that the events are all happening simultaneously. Theon could’ve saved Yara a week before he arrived.  Things like Gendr running to the wall and Daenerys getting north of the wall in that span of time was ridiculous, yes. But not everything is happening simultaneously, that’s the way I think of it.
Bells start ringing in kings landing. Danearys opens menu. Quicksave.
There must also be an “explorer” mode in the options, because (some of) the main characters were playing against some terrible AI to be able to make it out alive.
It's unfortunate that people still can't grasp that not everything in an episode is taking place at the same time. And that there's a difference between fast travel and time skips
Doesn't work for rowing.
Between the fast travel and the fact that only a dozen or so named characters dictate significant world events now, Westeros sure doesn’t feel like the massive, living world it used to.
Oi bud don’t steal memes
Open world Game of Thrones RPG... 

I don't need it..  I don't need it.. I don't need it..

I NEED IT!!!
Arya certainly fast-traveled at the end of last episode, that’s for sure.
Arya’s library scene legit felt like a video game in stealth mode.
Everyone at the Hardhome campfire trying to fast travel to Castle Black:

“You cannot fast travel while enemies are nearby”
That is why Bronn is taking so long, he never been to winterfell!
Can we all just agree to change the next Elder Scrolls game to be GOT/Westeros based? 
I’d even spring for the “north of the wall” and “iron islands” dlc.
This is great! Well done 👍🏻
That looks sick
Maybe he's a merman like Varys.
This just makes me realize I want a GoT epic RPG...
Shoulda made a new save there...
Theon can hearthstone there because Winterfell is his home
Seriously remember when it took a whole episode to travel from winter fell to Kings landing? Now the entire dothraki horde can magically appear south of Kings landing from the dragonstone a 3000 mile journey just bam done

This confused me when I first saw it, he could of avoided a whole trip. Before they set sail he could of said "You go, Im leaving to help the Starks" instead he waits until they are traveling. Smooth Theon, smooth.
/u/metxe LOLOLOL
It takes a month to travel from Winterfell to KL.  let's see how they handle it.
I’m assuming more time is covered in these seasons and they’re just not showing the travelling/uneventful parts that were shown more often in earlier seasons
Only three people in the show with a high enough level to get a flying mount.
/u/vredditshare
I want them to make somewhere in their world an actual game, like maybe a part in the book George R. R. Martin didn’t write about much like the way east in essos or a game about Roberts rebellion
[removed]
Unless your Bronn and "that fooking family". You take your time.
Fast travel doesn't get unlocked until you reach season 6
During this scene I wanted him to jump off the side of the boat and dolphin swim away.
Wait for that part in the books, we are getting 300 pages of Theon travelling and not doing much in the meantime.
Should have jumped to the clip of him jumping off the boat and abandoning her in the other season
Meanwhile the damn Night King takes 10 minutes to get across the courtyard and kill Bran.
Lmao, Melissandre's spell is a scrambled version of "the gaming mods are cucks"
I would play the shit out of a Game of Thrones open world rpg though
You cannot fast travel with enemies nearby
Holy shit I love this.
Take my upvee
People seem to forget the king traveled 1-2 months within. S1e1
Bronn is still looking for transportation mode
[No Spoilers] Squad looking fine

Wonder if King's Landing has any mango pods
Arya looks like she is judging a runway at fashion week.
Serious question... Why does Bran have no pants on?
Bran has that "working from home over Skype" look going on.
turns out arya never actually got her sight back after jaqen took it
Weekend at Arya’s
Fun facts from the camera readout:

Even though they shoot in Europe which uses the PAL system (25 frames per second) for video production, they are shooting in the North American format NTSC at the standard 23.976 frames per second.  Ever watch British TV shows that air in the US?  They have a certain "fake" look due to the conversion of PAL to NTSC for broadcast, so they are avoiding that here.

&#x200B;

They are shooting at 24fps, but since they are doing this in Europe using European lights, they have to use a different shutter angle of 172.8 degrees.  Shutter angle is like shutter speed, but it takes into account what frame rate you are shooting in so you don't have to adjust shutter when changing frame rates.  Standard shutter angle for cinema is 180 degrees, which gives the most natural film-like motion blur we are used to seeing.  But lights in Europe operate at 50hz, while lights in the US operate at 60hz.  Shooting with the wrong shutter angle can cause a strobing effect because of a lack of sync with the lights, so you adjust your shutter angle to compensate.  Films like Saving Private Ryan famously used 45 and 90 degree shutter angles to get rid of motion blur and freeze dirt from explosions and stuff in mid-air and make it seem more "gritty".  I'm sure the battle scenes in GOT also used this technique.

&#x200B;

Anyways, that's pretty much the interesting stuff we can gleam from this.

So Bran was free balling the WHOLE time?
Didn't even notice the bottle on Bran's head

Sansa Stark, Queen of the Vape
At least Sophie doesn't let her juul exposed during scenes. She must keep them somewhere in that many layers of clothes she's wearing. Now we need a pic of Maisie sailing west wearing sunglasses 😉
Arya looks she mastered the sitting up while sleeping move. And is just taking a nice little nap.
Arya is conjuring her inner Stevie Wonder, Bran is getting his modeling career started, Sansa is vaping. Nice.
>!All hail No Pants Bran, first of his name, king of the six kingdoms!!<
I think Bran skipped leg day.
His legs may not work but he's working those legs
So many people acting like they’ve never seen someone vape before. My question is why tf isn’t Bran wearing pants and what are those cords under him?
Brans legs work! It’s all a lie!
Bran looks like he’s got a saucy garter belt on under that tunic
I need Arya to play Neo in a Matrix reboot.
Bran the broke
Left to right:  
- Maverick  
- Doctor Scott  
- Sansa Stark of the North, first of her name, second in line for the Vape of Arryn, Huffer of Juul Pods, called Sansa Cloudbreath, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Stash, the Burnt, the Smoker of Blaze
Bran has the legs of a beautiful young woman.
Arya: Deal with it
the show shouldve ended with sansa doing a vape trick on the throne and everyone kneeling in reaction
Sophie Turner vape god
Has... has Bran not been wearing Pants this whole time?
Sansa part of Vape Naysh??
Same energy as a certain Deadpool 2 scene.
Didn't know Sansa vaped
"Don't do anything stupid, Maisie. You didn't break any laws. It's legal in many states now. Just act normal."
Bran looks like Deadpool regenerating his legs.
Arya looking like perfect combination of modern gangsta and ancient warrior which she is.
Sophie Turner is juuling in literally every pic I see her in
Sophie taking dabs in between takes like “maybe this shit will make sense if I’m stoned” 😂
IS SOPHIE HITTING A JUUL
r/cursed_images
Bran’s skipping leg day it seems
Juuling wtf? I didn’t expect Sansa Stark to be one of those people.
I have many questions about Bran
I hope that no-fucks-given Maisie Williams becomes a new meme image.
So the prophecy of cersei being replaced by someone younger and more beautiful was true.
King Bran the Bro Shorts
*Juul:  your “no smoking while in costume” loophole!*
...is Sophie Turner vaping?
A boy needs no pants
In this thread:

- 75% Sansa's lemony lemony lemon vape
- 23% No-pants Bran
- 2% Bottleboi
- 0% A girl has no fucks to give
Arya looking like she just landed a role in Matrix 4
I am old. Why are so many people seemingly stunned by the vaping?
And not a single leg day was completed in Westeros.
Arya looks like she's all buzzed after hitting 5 straight rips from the juul
The JUUL pack survives lol
The king doesn't need no stinkin' pants.
First thing thAt come to mind was old photos of movie sets where actors and actresses have a cigarette dangled between their fingers. They look sophisticated and sexy. Now we get shot of actors/actresses smoke vapes, looking like they are trying to get that last bit of milkshake out
I like these characters so much but I know what happens to a lot of young actors and actresses. Here's hoping these three don't turn into the next Lindsay Lohan, Macaulay Culkin, etc.
Bran: fuck pants
Maisie gives zero fucks. 

Isaac looks like he is not wearing pants and he is damn proud of it. 

Sophie is hitting that dank vape.

Seeing Arya, a cold blooded assassin run scared like that has me thinking she saw some seriously messed up shit...like some walker turning her dead ancestors buried in the crypts into wights
On Jon's return;

Arya: Brother!

Sansa: Brother.

Bran: Cousin.

Jon:  waitwut?
Jon’s definitely riding a dragon this season. 
I wonder whether Jon is standing in front of Ned’s tomb, contemplating the man who believed was his father or if he’s looking at Lyanna’s tomb and thinking how all this time his mother’s been dead for years, and he’s walked past her before. Gonna be so emotional either way,
Wake me up on April 14 please. Thanks. 
"Our enemy doesn't stop, doesn't tire, doesn't feel"

Cuts to Cersei
Everyone fighting and Cersei is just chilling and drinking as usual
I have a feeling we are about to lose half of the cast in the battle for winterfell. 
So happy to know Tormund, Beric and Edd are alive! Was worried about them :)
Final scene of Brienne and co looking and at the undead army gave me chills holy crap
Im gonna be so pissed if i die before the series finale.

Update: I'm gonna be so pissed if I die before I see the remake with better writing. This season was the worst.
Jon is sooo gonna ride Rhaegal.

Edit: it's Rhaegal, not Rheagal.
Aww man, I was enjoying the 15 minute videos analyzing 3 seconds of an HBO preview. What are they going to do with an actual trailer?
TORMUND IS ALIVE FUCK YEAH!!
GREYWORM LEADING THE LEGIONS OF UNSULLIED. 

GENDRY LEADING THE BLACKSMITHS IN DRAGONGLASS WEAPON CONSTRUCTION. 

HARRY STRICKLAND AND EURON’S FLEET CARRYING THE GOLDEN COMPANY. 

PODRICK ON THE FRONTLINES. 

**MY ARTERIES ARE EXPLODING.** 
DRAGONS OVER WINTERFELL!!!!
This will be Jaime's season.
I HAVE CHILLS!

I wonder who or *what* Arya is running from?
I have nothing constructive to say, I'm just here to squeal with everyone else.
I’m australian and woke up 15 mins ago to pee, I am SO glad I did. HOLY SHIT
The most powerful part of the trailer for me:

"I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise."

Jaime, I fucking love you man. This has been one hell of a journey for you, if someone would have told me 8 years ago that you would end up as my favourite character I'd slap them silly. 
Inject this directly into my veins
Gendry looking absolutely juicy
"I know death. He's got many faces. I look forward to seeing this one."

Holy hell! 
Damn Viserion's legs are tiny now. 
BERIC AND TORMUND ARE ALIVE!

^(at least for now)
Jon and Dany in the crypts is definitely gonna be after Jon finds out his real parents. He's looking more brooding in that shot than usual. He's probably standing at Lyanna's statue!
Gendry looking like a SNACK
#where is Ghost?!
O fuck o god my dick is the Tower of Joy
I thought I couldn't get any more hyped... I was wrong.
Ramin Djawadi is going to outdo himself this season. The moment Jon sees Arya and the Stark theme plays will be phenomenal. The Night King will get a full appropriate track as opposed to a motif, the battle sequences will be greater and more diverse with high up moments and great lulls for slow mo parts. Ooooo god I cannot wait to hear what this season sounds like. 
About fucking time


The end begins
Jaime: "I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise." 

Friendship over with Cersei, Dany is my new best friend.
I'm wet 
WHERE IS BRONN
Every other character has banded together for the greater good and Cersei is utterly alone in a giant throne room.  
Davos will be shitting his brains out before this battle. 
Grey Worm’s face as he puts on his helmet before the battle doesn’t inspire much confidence
This is gonna last longer than 4 hours. I need a doctor
[deleted]
I wonder what Cersei is teary-eyed about? Maybe she will have a miscarriage as she’s drinking wine again or she heard the news about Jaime leaving Kings Landing, I guess we’ll find out next month. Can’t wait!
The dragons swooping through the canyon/valley gave me serious chills.  
Love Arya's reaction to (presumably) seeing them fly.

And I can't fucking wait to see Jon ride Rhaegal. Fuck it's gonna be amazing.

~~Edit - Tenner says Daario is leading the Golden Company~~ Hoping someone has a source, but it looks like I'm wrong here. Oh well.
This trailer is the perfect smokescreen to protect the real final battle: CLEGANEBOWL
IS THAT GENDRY?
The Hound scene at 1:19 gives me more confidence that he will wield the Lightbringer. He finally conquers his fear of fire and is able to wield the most powerful sword.
HOLY FUCK ONLY 40 DAYS LEFT
https://i.imgur.com/BNmwjQv.jpg

The “oh shit he’s my nephew” face 
Arya at the beginning of this trailer is me trying to post this wherever I possibly can.
Hell ya, I love how they are keeping CLEGANE BOWL completely under wraps 
[deleted]
Well now I will be completely useless at work for the rest of the day.
Definitely looked like some running direwolf paws at one point? Is the Nymeria plot coming back??
Brilliant trailer. Didn't give much away either which is nice.
Jon: Our enemy does not stop. They do not feel.
Cersei: *stops and feels* 
It would be interesting if Jaime's name as Kingslayer went full circle and he ended up being the one to defeat the Night King. 

The same with Jon riding Rhegal, given it derives from his father's name. 
You won the karma race my dude, congrats
Anybody else feels that Arya was the bait. 

The way she holds her breath and composes herself before starting to run gives me such feels. Also, her dialogue that she is ready to face death seems foreshadowing to me.
Sansa is the secret weapon.
She  only needs to unleash the Phoenix and lays waste the entire White Walker army.

Looks like this sub reddit is not sleeping tonight??
Was that Jamie screaming in the fire-lit scene while Jon is talking?

Also, wtf happened to Arya? Was she in Winterfel?
GENDRY BE SMITHIN

ARYA BE WATERDANCIN
Is Cersei really going to blow up Kings Landing? 😱
Daenerys and Jon in front of Lyanna’s statue? 

My gosh I’m gonna cry.
Helm's Deep vibes, holy shit
Even thought I don't want it to happen, I have a feeling Jaime is going to die doing something truly honorable and complete his redemption arc. The scene of Cersei almost crying could be her hearing the news. 
Totally calling it right NOW: Ayra is running from a reincarnated, evil Sean Bean!!!! 

NED BEGAN THIS DAM SHOW, AND NOW HE'S GONNA END IT!!

edit 1: think about it, she has a dragonglass dagger but is running? CAUSE SHE COULD NEVER STAB HIM (i may be reaching) 
Gods we were excited back then.
We were so young back then
Jamie is Kingslayer, and he is about to die the most admirable death the show has seen
“Everything you did brought you to where you are now.” -Bran (0:30)

I wonder if this line is a response to Jamie arriving at Winterfell and apologizing to him....
Night King: Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all! 

White Walker lieutenant: What of the King in the North? 

 Night King: I will break him.﻿ 
[deleted]
The unsullied are gonna freeze their balls in winterfell. 

Oh...
Jon definitely riding Rhaegal 

I know most have already come to this conclusion but:

Dany rides Drogon = Drogo was Dany’s lover

Jon rides Rhaegal = Rhaegar was Jon’s father

Night King rides Viserion = Viserys is dead and also a giant dbag 
I've never been so conflicted on whether or not to watch a trailer. I must stay strong.
𝕎ℍ𝔸𝕋 𝕀𝕊 ℍ𝕐ℙ𝔼 𝕎𝕀𝕃𝕃 ℕ𝔼𝕍𝔼ℝ 𝔻𝕀𝔼
It looks like Jorah has Heartsbane in the trailer! House Mormont once again has a Valyrian steel sword. I think Sam giving it to him was the best choice, too.
Im not ready for it to end :(
GENDRY!!!!!!!
Cersei: "Y'all go fight the dead by yourselves. I'm staying right here in my castle."

Everybody effing dies in the north and the dead march on Kings Landing next.

Cersei: *shocked pikachu face*
Where my boy Hotpie at?
This didn't age well.
Gendry yes honey
wow only 4 months ago we didn't know how bad season 8 was going to be.
I'm just happy that Berric is in the trailer. 
Also: Is Brienne commanding the Greyjoy ships? 
I’ll never get sick of character reactions to seeing the dragons for the first time. 
Edit: can’t spell
HOLY SHITBALLS
Most of my theories crushed in that short clip.. back to the drawling board. 
Ok Alt shift X get on this shit!
I am calling my prediction for the end.  They never tell you the sex of the dragons. So I bet the final episode we will see dragon eggs. 
Cersei drinking wine again. Miscarriage confirmed.
Confirmed here first all! Jon rides a dragon!
HNNNGGGHHHHH 💦💦🌊🌊🌊🌊
Oh fuck, everyone's going to die
Half of Arya's face is covered in blood.. it looks like Sandor's face parallel
Hot take: Arya was running from bran in his wheel chair.
[SPOILERS] It's a shame we didn't get to spend more time in Valyria

Essos has so much potential for future stories
Prequel?
You don't want to spend much time there unless you want to join the Stone Men clan.
I want a prequel set in Valyria so bad!
there was also the 3rd continent of  Sothoryos, they have  Wyverns.
This makes me want a Planet Earth style series showing the various places in the WoIaF in their prime. 

Narrated by Beric Dondarrion, of course.
I think the less we see it, the cooler it is. The mystery is what keeps it exciting.
I would love a AAA rpg video game set in The Realm, preferably in Esos. I don’t even think GRRM has it all figured out yet. So much mystery and potential!!

1) Robert's Rebellion. Obviously, for reasons that are obvious. Young Ned, Young Robert, Young Robert's Warhammer, The Mad King, Rheagar, yes pls.

2) Old Valyria and Essos.

3) The Many Knights of Westeros. Barristan's Story. Jaime's Rise to Glory. Story of the Sword of the Morning Ser Arthur Dayne. Podrick Payne's tales and adventures after the White Walkers.

4)The tale of how Littlefinger learned to become Machiavelli after being a lil bitch his whole young life.

5) Political power drama of how an older, wiser, more confident Samwell Tarly modernizes the Citadel to actually be useful in some way, House of Cards style.

6) The Tales of the Onion Knight.

7) Tywin Lannister's young life and rise to power.

8) Literally anything about Braavos.

9) The Beginnings of the Faceless Men
Weve got spinoffs in the works. Im praying for stories in Essos.
Hate to be "that guy", but I didn't like this much. I understand why they did it, because they pretty much cut the Rhoyne out of show lore afaik, but I feel like it takes away too much of the mystery of Valyria for me. In the books a big deal is made about Euron being the only man crazy enough to sail to Valyria, so for Jorah to so easily navigate it (relatively speaking), I feel like it dampens just how bad it was. In my mind I always thought of it like Chernobyl, if that makes any sense.

Edit: typed more instead of lore
“We has to shorten the season cause we had no more stories to tell”
I really really hope we get some proper stories in Valyria and Braavos in the spinoffs, maybe some deeper backstories into the children of the forest Vs the first men too. The birth of the night king. The first men pushing them back and creating the wall. Azor ahai. Melisande and the valonqar. Roberts rebellion. The adventures and trials of Ser Arthur Dayne. 

Theres so much to explore I refuse to believe that crappy NK death is all we're gonna get.
Those Valyrians did NOT have the plot armor they needed to survive the doom.
I’d prefer to keep it for the books tbh as it would be much more terrifying tbh.
[deleted]
I’m literally just seeing Charizard statues right now
Y'all Dany is going to go back to Essos with Grey Worm and Missandei and the rest of her survivors and rule that continent she just destabilized, and she is going to take Sam's greyscale cure and restore Valyria.
When Asshai?
a sitcom featuring barbarians / aspiring farmers in the outskirts of valyria, who occasionally start to get their shit together and grow food + build cities, only to have their plans inevitably foiled by dragons.
When something in a story is cool because it’s mysterious, it’s usually not a good idea to explain it
Hopefully, HBO will develop a Robert's rebellion mini series.  I'd also like to see more of the building of the Seven Kingdoms.
Some thoughts on dead ends and disconnects, in no particular order:

 - The winter is a non-factor  after hearing how absolutely devestating this "worst winter in 1,000 years" was going to be. 

- The three cities Danny conquered fall off the ends of the writers desks, never to be heard from again after Danny leaves them for Westeros

- Dorne, the least willing of the Seven Kingdoms suddenly reverses course and  willingly joins in a new six part kingdom as a vassal, even as Sansa breaks the North away.  All the murders, negotiating and fear of war with Dorne that was stirred to a fever pitch by the Sandsnakes .... Poof.  Gone.

- The Dothracki, fanatics blood pledged to Danny, are basically wiped out by the Army of the dead, but somehow survivors outrun the zombies back to Winterfell and sit out the rest of the fight.  They reappear at Kings landing where they help sack the city for their Kalliese. After her murder...crickets. Who leads them now? Do they just become a wandering horde in Westeros? 

- Who ever planned the defense of Winterfell seemed to find a way to do absolutely everything wrong, yet the Army of the Dead, all bazillion of them, fail to take the castle 

- Kings Landing is utterly destroyed by dragon fire leaving 100's of thousands of people dead and rotting in the ruins. Every member of the old Government (Lannister) is butchered, yet somehow within a few weeks, everything is fine and building a navy and new brothels are the main concern.

- After years of build up as the unstoppable central boogyman of the story, the Night King and his Army are  destroyed by an exausted teenage girl ninja in one minute of one episode and yawn that's settled.

-  Bron, a lifelong fighting mercenary, is somehow accepted by the remaining nobles and people of High Garden as their Lord, and is made the Master of Coin, basically the Kingdoms Banker. 

- Pike and the Iron Born end as unimportant bit players.

- An unlimited supply of black leather has every major character dressing like Batman.

I'd like to see general exploration of Essos and more of Dorne as well
The lands to the east are bigger. Valyria, the golden compass army, the dorthraki, and more all come from this land, and most of those populations are on its western coast. There is much unexplored territory to the east, and the whole continent has great mystery. 

I believe we will learn more in the spinoffs.
I would love a 10 episode season about the doom of Valyria.
There's just sooooo much of that world and history. HBO gonna be making shows about Westeros and Essos for decades. It'll be like Star Wars.
Where is this picture from? I don't remember seeing this in the show...?
im sorry but we need a GOT single player GAME WE NEED IT WE NEED IT WE NEED IT not necessarily following the starks but following someone else WE GOTTA HAVE IT
Yi ti should invade with their Chinese dragon.
Was this place in Game of throne?  Because i cant remember seeing this statue
Three words: Black oily stones
I want to see more Essos in general but the show only really cares about Westeros which makes sense but still
[SPOILERS] One second from every episode.

0:52-0:54

*Jon Dies*

*Sees nasty naked hag waiting for him on the other side*

Nope! Not dying.
[removed]
Looking back from Season 1 it’s so strange seeing not just the characters but actors when it all started. I really recommend to anyone who hasn’t to rewatch all the seasons, one after the other, I’ve done this since Season 2, rewatch all the previous seasons in the run up to the new seasons, and it makes whole journey better.
Okay, now do this for the unnamed soldier in every episode.
The Red Woman looking like Smeagol gets me every time
Don't let this distract you from the fact that in season 8, Sandor Clegane threw the Mountain off the Red Keep, and plummeted 100's of feet into a burning building.
Jon dead then alive...kissing Dany then stabbing her...
 I love this. It almost made me cry
[deleted]
That was pretty cool.  Now I'm debating on whether or not I start to watch the entire show again.

Anyone else?
Let'splay a game: there are 73 episodes but the video is 83 seconds long

Find out which scenes are longer or if every scene took 1.136 seconds
The way its cut makes it look like Jon blew the biggest load of his life in old hag Melisandre
Haunting combined with Florence+the Machine's Jenny of Oldstones
Gods this show was good then
Wow. 

Say what you will about these last two seasons. (Or season 5 onwards?) this has been one of the greatest tv shows/series and it’s been an honour and privilege to watch it. 

 The books themselves from Avon onwards are different so I’m excited to compare and contrast with GoT

Looking forward for any future spinoffs.
I'm going to miss this show. Flaws aside, it will go down as one of my favorites.
this just made me super sad

RIP GoT, it was a hell of a ride
Just had to make me watch the mountain one more time didnt you
Me before starting the clip: Bet there's going to be no scenes of Sansa.

Sometimes, I hate being right.
/u/dankerino_420 died for this

No matter how bad people say the writing was this past season. What a wild ride. I feel fortunate to have experienced this journey.
Whatever the thoughts on the show and writing, there is no denying that the visuals and score have been outstanding. For a show to have such kind of spectacle and vfx on display is unthinkable. It will always be good to dive into Westeros again just for those breathtaking visuals.
I'm glad someone took the time to do this.   I was really upset with last night's ending, but it's shouldn't negate how much I enjoyed the heck out of the show, the writing, the costumes, the acting and everything else.  Thank you.
Alright, I just had the dumbest fucking moment of my life.

Sees the title: One second from every episode.

Thinks: but there haven't been 123 episodes.
Damn karma whores
Seriously? No Sansa? 🙁
Wow what a journey!  All complaints about this season aside I’m very grateful for this show!!

Another post stolen from another sub at the top of /r/gameofthrones.

Haha it all progressed very nicely until the final 13 seconds where its just like wtfffff
So it's cool to steal original content and not give credit to original source from the freefolk subreddit
Really fantastic video. I love how not only was each one second clip a really beautiful shot but also one that told the story. Sadly, it reminded me of just how epic the show was before this season and the things it made me feel when watching. Ah well. Great video.
This video highlights just how jarring the transition to Mad queen was.
You going to give credit to the person who created this?
You ever notice how most of this subs top posts are just stolen leftovers from that other sub the mods are too embarrassed to let us name?
That was beautiful. Thank you.
Now do a first scene last scene for everyone on the show.
This was great. Perhaps they should have done a clip show for the finale.
The last episode should have been Jon petting Ghost.
Wait, where was Bobby B ?
A bit off topic: At the end of the finale, it sounded like they were _singing_ something in the tune of the GOT theme. Anyone know if there were actual lyrics or it just felt like that?
Fuck . Now I have to rewatch the entire show again.
/r freefolk sends their regards
This subreddit should be renamed r/stolenfromfreefolk
Wow you couldn't even wait an hour before reposting it? r/trashy.
Damn son you straight up didn’t give credit to who made this
[removed]
Stolen?
You fucking reposter. Downvote this bitch
At least credit the person you reposted this from.
Second stolen video in a day. Y'all are pathetic
All the memories come rushing in. Pretty dope.
Wow. 

Say what you will about these last two seasons. (Or season 5 onwards?) this has been one of the greatest tv shows/series and it’s been an honour and privilege to watch it.

Looking forward for any future spinoffs.
What an absolutely fucking amazing show.
Bravo
Jesus, just seeing everything after 1:11 really drives home how depressingly sped up this season was.

I mean really. Just take note of how quickly and significantly the characters and state of the world changed over the course of just 5 episodes! It feels like 2-3 seasons of development and filler was just completely cut out, and I say this as someone who ultimately enjoyed season 8.
Nice repost
It's pretty crazy you can tell the exact episode from watching the 1sec clips you picked. Very well done OP.
I probably would have replaced the John and Dany snow field kiss with the Night King dying but pretty awesome overall.
This makes me want to binge from the start. Never got to binge the show once, as I've watched it from the day 1 on Sundays.
This show *was* so good!
Because of this I have entered a weird cycle. After the disappointment of this season I saw this and remembered how much I love the show but then I think of the final season and how sad I was for it to end like that but then I think of how good the rest of it was...

Either way I still love the show as a whole, good of the many outweighs the few
This makes me so sad because watching those early scenes reminds me how good the series used to be :(
Really puts how wasted that build was with the final season into perspective.
It’s actually amazing how you see the character development of Daenerys in a few seconds and how bad it eventually turned out. Going from a beautiful kissing scene under waterfalls to frickin burning entire King‘s Landing. Man they fucked her up
Gotta love this sub stealing content then deleting any post that calls them out on it.
Nice repost you got here...
That was better than S08E06
Bunch of fuckin knealers
That is f*ing brilliant!
Weird, those last 13 seconds seemed really rushed and full of shitty writing...
So now all y’all stealing stuff from twitter too?
I got chills. 

Fuck everyone who shits on this show. We got 71 episodes probably costing close to $600million with ever increasing production values and top-notch performances, costumes, cinematography and directing. 

It'll be 25 years before something this ambitious is attempted again. I feel so lucky.
Still better pacing than season 8 

&#x200B;

\*hides\*
Still better paced than season 8.
makes me want to rewatch the first 6 seasons
Well done sir
Ok that was pretty damn cool
Well done.  This is great
This is the kind of content I like to see post show. 

Well done.
This is absolutely beautiful. The opening theme is timed perfectly with the video.

Thank you for sending chills down my spine and helping me remember why I fell in love with Game of Thrones. I was just as emotional from this video as I was from watching the final scenes of the finale. Seriously, thank you.
Damn, now I have to rewatch the who'll show again
aw shiet why you have to make me get all emotional and teary eyed again
Very well done. Thank you for this.
My friend is about to start the show for the first time. Should he just watch this instead?
Nothing has convinced me more to watch this show than this video.

Still can't afford HBO, but at least now I'll get around to it.
This is great, but can you make one where its 48 to 95 minutes of each episode in one clip?
I’m sad it’s over.. such an amazing story
This would have been great if they left out Tyrion for comedic purposes.
Next time make it one death per episode!
Thanks for this!

I've since downloaded your video so others outside of Reddit can see. [Here's the link.](https://youtu.be/kggENbqirwI)
absolutely stunning. the most satisfying shot was definitely dead joffery.
So, Jon died, then it showed the red witch takin off her necklace, then it showed Jon waking up. Jon dying and waking up were back-to-back episodes so either something is out of order or they’re putting more than one clip from each episode in
It’s over, isn’t it? Isn’t it? Isn’t it over?
Seems like a lot of stuff happened in those last 6 seconds.
Wow, seeing the visuals early on you can see a difference.
This show was so beautiful
So, we're rewatching the show? That's what you're saying?
what a fucking epic show
BUT WHERE IS SANSA.
Awesome.  A good reminder amongst all the complaints about how great this show has been.
Dang what a great show it was
Thanks for reminding how good this show once was.
I’m really gonna miss watching this show:(
Thank you Thrones, for everything
This has already been stolen by the Instagram account thronesmemes, Jesus
I was enjoying the video when i realized..."oh shit im probably gonna see Oberyn get killed aga..." and i see his crushed skull and now i am sad.
Nostalgia intensifies!
And now our watch has ended :(
Puts this season into perspective. Jon kissed Dany. Then she's angry then she's dead.

It was a decent season but I would have loved some filler.
What a fucking ride.
Watching this with [https://youtu.be/J2QE8pR2lX4?t=1287](https://youtu.be/J2QE8pR2lX4?t=1287) (Mario Rainbow road jazz cover) playing in the background to make this seem like an anime/sit com hybrid.
If you steal something, atleast give credit to OP
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Gave me the feels, been with the show since the beginning and read the books prior to that. A lot of years invested in this story for me, going to miss it. Hoping GRRM releases the next book sooner than later.
[Spoilers] Now that the show is about to end, we should give credit to arguably the best actor not talked about anymore
Jack Gleeson. King Joffrey. That dude was an unbelievable actor on GoT. He convinced all of us that he was a psychopathic, evil brat. Everyone hated him, and it takes a truly incredible actor to pull that off.
I am not...TIRED!
The way he sat on the Iron Throne was incredible, from his posture alone you could discern his entire character. The faux arrogance just pours out of him.
Totally right. I hated that kid.
The script was already good enough, but his sneer made the role.
That was a series all on its own, everything to his death.  Gleeson was so perfect in that role.  I never thought I'd cheer when a bratty child died so gruesomely.
He had pretty much every negative trait one could have without any positives.  He was entitled, a coward, unmanly, spoiled, sadistic, abuser of women, arrogant and disrespectful.  It was a great portrayal.
I have to give a shout out to Charles Dance as Tywin, amazing presence...
Best part is he is actually a super nice guy.
[deleted]
30 seconds into Joffrey's first scene I turned to my wife (who had been reading the books) and said "Please tell me somebody stabs that kid."
indeed. Also note Joffrey was the only one who was like "shouldn't we do something about that" concerning the dragons.
Better not forget Charles Dance, Mark Addy and Diana Rigg (Tywin Lannister, Robert Baratheon and Olenna Tyrell)
I don't know if he is not talked about anymore. Joffrey is still pretty much the face of hated TV villains
He was fantastic. Actually, I was also impressed by the young man who played Tommen. He played the role of being young, wanting to do right, and being thrust into a role unexpectedly quite beautifully. Especially when you consider that this is a much more subtle thing to play than evil maniac.

Joffrey was so horrible. I read somewhere that the poor actor would get angry glares - sometimes verbal assaults - on the streets! Takes a great actor to garner that level of hate.
I would have loved an alternate GOT where he didn't die and Margaery got to manipulate him for a season or two. RIP Joffrey, my favorite person to hate, and RIP Margaery, the best player of the game.
Such a tremendous talent. Even the way he'd stand would make you want to bash him in the face with a brick. 

https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/45e99245-33f2-43f6-886c-ac75abbca6f1.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70

For my money though if we're going early actors I'm with Harry Lloyd as being the best. That guy got like five episodes of time and made such a mark his voice was still instantly recognizable when they used his lines in that pre-ep5 "previously on" montage seven seasons later.
Harry Lloyd as Viserys fucking amazing actor wanted to see more of him
Him and Iwan Rheon. I mean Jack was great, we hatted Joffrey for so long, but if Ramsay Bolton is the "most evil" person in kings landing it's because Iwan made such a terrific job playing him.  
The scenes with Alfie Allen, are one of the best of GoT.  
I mean, I don't know how it will play out next Sunday, but even if everyone ends up hatting the finale of GoT, one thing nobody can say is that the acting was bad, because we watched top notch acting through out all of the seasons.

Edit: I meant to say Westeros, not Kings Landing.
[deleted]
Honestly? Pretty much every actor in the early seasons (which of course includes the actors we have today). I can't think of a single bad actor besides Shae's actress (and maybe that was just a personal thing where I couldn't stand her voice/accent/whatever) and that stable boy that Arya kills. I'm sure there's some I've just forgotten about, but almost every actor and actress portrayed their roles to such an extent that I was completely immersed in nearly every scene of the show. I wasn't watching actors on a screen (that's how I feel sometimes when watching shows like Supernatural or Walking Dead) but I'm watching these characters as is.
Yeah, Gleeson was awesome. ~~I forget, didn't he get bombarded off of social media because people couldn't separate the character from the actor ?~~ e: cool, apparently not.
Joffrey was THE cunt of this show in its glory seasons. Will be an iconic character always
god I was devastated when he died just because joffrey was so god damn fun to hate. brilliant performance.
[deleted]
Honestly, I think the casting across the board has been phenomenal. Joffrey was exactly as I pictured him when I read the books, as were basically all the main characters except Tyrion (obviously they didn't fuck his face up like the books did because he's on TV). 

I can't even think of anyone that they didn't nail, except maybe Ramsay Bolton, but again they had to make him photogenic since they gave him so much screen time.
especially for someone so young. most of the other teen actors just acted passively, not trying anything that would give them away. he had to display constant emotion in a leading roll
Charles Dance aka Tywin for me, I don't think anyone commanded a scene like him
The dude made us cheer when a boy was murdered in front of his own mother!  That takes skill beyond understanding!

And before anyone says what I have heard over and over bringing it up before: Yes, the writers and directors had input into it as well, but without the perfect actor, that would have fallen flat.
Honestly, looking back, Joffreys death may have been the last "whoa holy fuck" moment for me in the series. It seems that those moments are what defines the series early on, with Ned, the Red Wedding, Joffrey, etc, and I find that I've lost some of my emotional investment to the outcome of the characters.

That said, S8E5 did a great job of salvaging my interest. I thought it was a solid episode and I'm pretty excited to see how it all wraps up.

Edit: a few have mentioned Mountain be Oberyyn. That definitely qualified, and was 4 episodes later.
Theon and Ramsay had the best duo scenes I’ve seen in a long time.
Omg I despised Joffrey.
Watching that vicious bastard die gave me more pleasure than one thousand lying whores
Agreed! He managed to take his [dorky, adorable Irish face ](https://www.google.com/search?q=joffrey+actor&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari#imgrc=1IIKDrdDTd0lEM:) and make look like the most evil, punchable face in the world

Edit: he’s Irish, not British.
“I’m not TIRED!”

Great actor and amazing performance.
I love that after almost every scene where he was rude to someone he would apologize to them. Just a truly great person and actor.
Forget the Night King, King in da Norf, Dragon Queen, all that. Give me the Cunt King.
Jack Gleason is one of my favorite actors for this reason. Have a (wrong) Baratheon banner and a Joffrey Pop in my room.
Best actor for me was Charles Dance as Tywin. Every scene with him was just masterful.
Nope. The best actor is and always will be “Bearded Extra”.  He is the true king. Long may he reign!
I didn't think it was possible to hate TV Joffrey more than book Joffrey when the show first started, but Gleeson went and proved me wrong. Dude has some mad acting chops.
Man...I thought this was going to be Charles Dance...but Jack’s good too!
[No Spoilers] Feeling cute, might kill someone for some chickens idk

Wait, so he was... **acting** the entire time???
Even his face is twice as tall as Maisies.
The Hound looks like he could be a contestant in Hell's Kitchen.
Maisie Williams is both 12 years old and 24 years old at the same time idk why
Lots of people name their swords.

Lots of cunts.
“Ok ready? Everyone say CUUUUNT”
Narrrp?
Will never not upvote Rory.
Of course you want a fucking selfie. 

Lots of people take selfies. 

Lots of cunts.
what is this? Hound smiles, and Arya wears a dress and earrings... I'm confused
The Hound smiles?
I barely recognized the hound without his long hair and scowl.
If I ever meet him I'll ask him to call me a cunt.
Everyone says these two are super nice to fans too.
Somehow theyve managed to both look like a random fan of the other.
[deleted]
I don't want this show.to end
I’m gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this thread
I never noticed that the Hound was Homer Simpson all along.
Remember when Rory McCann was the Scots Porridge Oats guy in the 90's?

https://youtu.be/6tZ0LWGdTq0
In an interview about his life/boat life he said, "Someone that’s not going to be too big in the boat. Good cook. Is not prone to sea sickness. That would be the perfect woman for me." I am five feet tall, an amazing cook, and not prone to sea sickness. Dude marry me.
Hound looks to have lost a lot of weight.
Who's got two thumbs and likes stabbing cunts? These guys!
These 2 travelling together was some of the best writing in this show.

Also liked Arya & Tywin, and Sandor & Sansa also as well.
"The Hound" is an iconic character due in large part to the acting.  Well done Rory.
The I'm going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this place is the best line that has ever been uttered in television history.
Any man dies with a clean sword, I’ll rape his fucking corpse!!
Hey it's that guy from The Book Club.
I never expected they'd be my absolute favourite part of the story.
Holy dooly, Rory McCann just looks like the sweetest person! As does Maisie. I just want to cuddle them
My drunk wife: is that the mountain and qyburn?
Feeling cute, might develop the most wholesome and genuine relationship in the entire series later, idk.
I’m rewatching the entire show right now and I just watched that episode from season 4 last night lmao
I wanted a spin-off of Arya and the Hound traveling around Westeros killing baddies for chicken.
I just laugh when people call her ugly like dude she’s cute af
Naaarp
I just retrospect how she says to him: You're the worst shit in the 7 Kingdoms. :D
"If any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm going to have to eat every single chicken in this room."

“Mind blows up”
Looks like the Yarp guy

“Someone is”

Probably my favorite line in the whole series.

I love Rory Mccann’s goofy faces
Sandor and chickens is the only consistency that show has been able to keep throughout the show
He looks like the perfect guy to play Wreck it Ralph in live action movie.

Miss him already ❤️

For the rest of their lives, if they ever see each other in public, they will call each other by their GoT names.

Imagine being in a busy pub and hearing The Hound call for Ayra.
Omg I love him so much 😍
This post made me laugh harder than expected. Good job, OP
So that's what his smile looks like!
Sandor...Thanks you 😂😂

Legend says that he now prefers his chicken extra crispy just like the Clegane family!  

Too soon?
  
I'm sorry...

He really looks like Lurch from hot fuzz in this photo. I only recently found out that was rory mccann!
Somehow he almost looks more unsettling in this  than he does with the burn scars..
YARP!
I just can't rectify this picture with " A lot of cunts".
Yarp
Love it
I'd kill this meme for some chickens.  Hell, probably do it for free.

Please cast him as Thor in the next God of War

The guy who plays him actually lives a quiet life and likes working on boats or some shit, watched an interview but forgot he name, jolly dude
“Bring me one of those chickens”
I saw her tits
Rory McCann looks like he will eat me for breakfast even when he’s smiling. Maybe even more so
I'd like to have seen a spin off series, covering all their adventures while travelling. It'd be like a very dark version of "the littlest hobo", only instead of making friends and solving crimes everywhere they kill people.

[NO SPOILERS] I hope she survives

I am locking this thread as I need to go to bed and can't keep up moderating this thread. This comment seems to have polarized people and this thread has become extremely toxic. Too many comments promoting violence, rape, or telling people to kill themselves. Spoilers are also absolutely out of control in this "no spoilers" thread.
Biggest letdown is that we never saw her in a scene with Olenna.
She's not really listened to in the books, she has that sharp attitude but is shut down because she is little.
Her ability to put lords on blast is legendary. 

She’s earned the name the Bitch of Bear Island and I mean that in the most admirable way possible.
I think at this point the biggest twist would be everyone surviving.
[removed]
I feel like they're pushing it too far because she was hyped by the fandom.

"When you left you were a king, I don't know what you are now"

Jon should have replied with "I'm the man who came back with an alliance, an army, and *two fucking dragons*".
Plot twist, Lyanna Mormont will end up taking the iron throne.
Lyanna lost a lot of my respect when she, and many of the other north lords, decided Jon relieving his title as King in the North was more important than the end of the world. 

Like come on girl, you’re supposed to be the voice of reason among these squabbling lords.
> I hope she survives

#NO

- George R. R. Martin
not gonna lie, after the first few times it got a little cringey. not because she's a girl. because she's an adolescent
The problem is that's all her character is. She literally hasn't had a single scene where she isn't acting tough or shaming grown men. In all honesty, she's probably one of the most one-dimensional characters on the show, who really shouldn't have had any more screentime after the BoB. But now she exists purely for "Grrl power!" even though we have actual fleshed out characters like Sansa or Brienne to fill in that role.
I'm sure she will have plenty of opportunities to do that in the future.
Wait her last name really IS Ramsey?!
[deleted]
She’s a one trick pony as a character, I’m over it
what an weird and cringeworthy thing to say
That is.. kind of cringey actually.
Bet money she dies in Jorah's arms
Unpopular opinion: I've always hated her
Boring.... every single one of her scenes is the same. Her character is also an idiot, so honestly I wont be upset when she kicks the bucket next episode.
That doesn't sound healthy at all
She was cool af at first. She’s gotten a smidge annoying since.
She’s going to play characters who do this exclusively now.
So we're supposed to believe that Jon will allow 10-12 year olds to fight walkers?
🙄
Yup, this is going to be a nice and civilized comment section. For sure.
Why does anyone want to shame anyone? This has so many upvotes because of the "fuck men" mentality. How about everyone treats each other decent. Shit like this is creating a bigger divide.
B R A V E
I'm in the minority. I thought her scenes in season 6 were fantastic, but she's worn out her welcome in a show where so many other better characters are desperate for screen time.
Shut up, Wesley.
Ehh, it was cool when it happened during season 6. Now it's old, especially considering you're expecting her to do it every time she speaks. I'm over it.
Why is this celebrated?
I'm sure that's exactly what she said
Cannot wait to watch this character die.
She is worse then the Sand Snakes. Pure fan service
Sounds toxic.
Her act is getting a little old at this point though.
If that was her favorite part of filming, then she probably dies
Shes boring, funny at first but got old fast, dont care either way what happens to her just like that umber kid, they are secondary throwaway characters.
Holy shit I thought her last name was some play on the show (hadn’t looked it up before) but the internet is telling me that this little girl (now 15) is worth $160 fucking million?
I hope she gets slaughtered, would be hilarious.
She won’t.
Of course she can, this is a fantasy show
Really...? Imagine if any male character had said “my favorite part was getting to shame the women!” 

Really? You stared in the most popular epic series possibly of all time and your favorite part was getting to shame men? 

Can we drop the battle of the sexes thing already it’s so old and honestly insulting.
I would consider her impressive if she managed to shame Daenarys and Cersei...until then, her age and her men are the reason no one is snapping back at her.
Cringe
Cringe
"Toxic masculinity " 😐😕
Any sort of political zeal or superiority complex is extremely toxic for children. It's sad that we celebrate this sort of attitude from a child, whether it's for ironic humor or not.
*Feminists everywhere start wetting their pants*
She’s definitely dying. This GOT not Harry Potter.
I'm confused, why this was posted in r/gameofthrones and not r/cringe? What a weird ass comment.
Imagine if a young boy said this about a group of older women....
I fucking hate her character. I sincerely hope she dies next episode.
Haha casual sexism is hilarious, people would flip their shit if the roles were reversed. I feel bad for this girl that she has been exposed to the misandry is today's society. Whoever raised her, or had a heavy influence on her is a terrible person, I hope she realizes how sexist this, and apparently the people around her are. Here's to hoping she sees the error in her ways.
She was a fun little gimmick for an episode or two but it got old fast.
Would this be cheered the same if it was a small male child actor “shaming” a bunch of grown women?
Is that...sexism daddy?
Here's the full quote since a ton of people are hating on and talking shit about a 16 year old girl who likes playing a confident, strong-willed girl as a girl with confidence and anxiety issues.

> "I think the opportunity to stand up in front of a load of grown men and shame them. I think playing confident characters also helps with your own confidence. Say you’re in a situation where you’re feeling anxious or nervous — you can become a character and work through it that way. I’ll miss that about her." -- Bella Ramsey


But no, do prattle on about her being a 3rd wave feminist, "gurrl power", how the role is "toxic" for for her since she said that, and hurling insults at her.

You know, rather than being mature and reading the full quote and understanding what she was saying.
She was fed that line, right?
Well considering everyone now seems to hate this character, I’d like to put my opinion out there and say that I still very much enjoy her. I love how strong her opinions are and that her people rally behind her so effortlessly.
Oh wow, people here are actually calling that quote "sexist"? How thick can you get... I mean, sure, if you just read the words and forget the context, but *who does that?*

Look, let me expand that quote for you:

"The opportunity to stand up in front of a load of grown men [which in a normal societal context would be impossible due to the invalidation I would be facing due to the power difference from being a child and of a sex considered to be lesser at least in the depicted world and the historical age it represents] and shame them [for the things they would deserve to be shamed for, thus providing a powerful fantasy that the power differences embedded in society can be overcome if your cause is just and there's sound reason behind what you are saying]"

Seriously. It's obvious.

Like, if Sigourney Weaver would reply "I'll miss the most when I got to blast away the aliens" you don't go claiming it's an anti-immigration or even xenophobic statement. Sure, technically the word has same meaning, but the alieness obviously wasn't really the issue with those creatures.

Just like the menness obviously isn't the issue here.
Reverse the roles on this statement. Yeah, long way to go on gender people.
Misandry.
Jorah should've asked her to "defend" the crypts.
Well that's pathetic
Girl powah! The only way women can be assertive and dominant is in fiction.
The problem is that's all her character has become lately...
man bad hehe
Imagine if the genders were reversed.
Ah yes, indoctrinate them early
The King's Hand guilding icon is neat.
If the genders were reversed y’all would call him a misogynist troll
Men bad! Shame them I must!
[removed]
God I hope they kill her next episode, she was fun at first but now she is so fucking annoying
Just a dumb kid that thinks she knows what she’s talking about but really doesn’t
This is the definition of sexism
Cool. Glorify man hating. We already know what you are.
Lmao imagine if Rickard had said the inverse. Everyone would give him props right?
[removed]
:eyeroll:
Great standard being set for future generations. For shame
What’s cool about that? Why shame anyone?
Is it just me who finds her incredibly cringe-worthy? The gimmick was funny once or twice, but has grown old very quickly.
Yikes. Now I’m even more ready for her to stop talking.
What was her purpose in the show, I don’t remember anymore.
If she survives then she's got more plot armor than the entire squad that went North of the wall to catch a wight
Supposed to. be cute but kind of tired. A bit unfortunate though because the producers def didn't intend for the audience to get so annoyed with her butting into the exploits of everyones' favorite characters.
I hope she dies.
She’s to annoying to live.
Shame them for being men? How dare they?
[removed]
I hope she tries to fight, because she's full of piss and vinegar and zero wisdom, and she gets stomped in two seconds by a white walker because oh wait she's a ten year old girl who weighs 74 lbs.
SHe is most certainly dead.
Hold up.. she’s 16 years old?
Sure she did
Yeah nah, that character has no need to have that much screen time. She doesnt contribute anything to the story and it makes no sense for her to be that influential. She is just a fan service character
wow! epic! girls rock!
She's so badass. One of my favorite characters for sure
She's good at her role, we will definitely miss her
[removed]
She was clearly very well cast.
[deleted]
She'll always be our little bad ass
ITT:  OMG she’s so sexist!  Men are so oppressed on this medieval fantasy show where most women are treated as second class citizens and regularly raped!  [sobbing intensifies]
She’s like a modern, ruthless Shirley Temple!
NOPE!  Eaten by zombie bear!
I noticed that everyone describes her as a ‘character’, yet she does not have much of an arc at all. She had a nice, distinctive moment or two in season 6, but she lacks a lot of development compared to other players in the story.

Just my two cents.
The actress is also the voice of Hilda, another badass little lady
She is such a talented actor and I hope to see more work from her. It was great seeing her work on the show.
I expect her to be like brutally ripped in half by the dead.
Lyanna is boring. She's cool at first but she's just a broken record.
I like her, but I don't really care if she makes it or not.
As the night king kills her she better have a sick burn that melts him
[removed]
She's amazing, and admirably intimidating.
Because she knows that only works in fantasyland
[No Spoilers] How George R.R. Martin himself pictured the Iron Throne illustrated by Douglas Wheatley

Imagine if you tripped coming down.
"Yeah nice work blacksmith, but do you have anything with more swords?"
https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne

I always see the one on this wiki page cited as what GRRM points to. Same idea, but a way cooler pic IMO.
Well they say the Iron Throne is made of 1000 swords, the series Iron Throne barely have 100
“Fuck it, we’re doing 5,000,000 blades.”
Just read this part in Fire and Blood last night!! Queen Rhaenyra (in pic) kept accidentally cutting herself on the swords, which signified that the throne “didn’t want her”. Would have an interesting visual in the series— an unworthy ruler e.g. Cersei, “mad Dany”, Jeoffrey etc with injuries from the throne (and ensuing infection????)
The king would die if he trips on those lol
Can't they at least put in a bean bag for a seat?

Maybe some guardrails?

Cupholders?

Ooh and a slide!
Unpopular opinion - this would have looked really dumb in the show. Its one of those things that work in books but not on TV. I'd roll my eyes everytime I had to see tommen sitting in something like that
I love Douglas Wheatly. He worked on Star Wars: The Dark Times comic series. He took forever to draw the comics, and Dark Horse contemplated several times letting him go, but the fans' reaction to his work was so positive they kept him on and let him work at his pace. 

I'm so sad we couldn't see a proper conclusion to that series.
[deleted]
The fact that so many people are fighting to sit on that monstrosity is beyond me
I feel claustrophobic just zooming in on it.
I'd rather GRRM picturing a finished book series.
[deleted]
This is absolutely my favorite version of the Iron Throne. From A Wiki of Ice and Fire:  


 "The Iron Throne is an asymmetric monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and twisted metal. It is uncomfortable, and the back is fanged with steel which makes leaning back impossible. Aegon I had it made this way deliberately, saying that a king should never sit easy. King [Aerys II Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen), the "Mad King," was always cutting himself upon it, and it is said that the throne itself has caused the deaths of several people"
Imagine being the maid who has to dust that.
You know what's crazy? In hundreds of years no one swallowed their pride and said "fuck it let's get a more comfortable throne"
Those might actually be the thousand swords of Aegon‘s enemies
It looks like a hedgehog with stairs.
WHAT?

I said SEND A RAVEN TO WINTERFELL

WHAT? You’ll have to SPEAK UP. 

Gods! HANG ON. I’M COMING DOWN. JUST A MINUTE. stupid fucking throne. 

WHAAAAT? SPEAK. UP.
#Those are the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. The TV throne has like less than 100 swords.
the throne in the show looks like something your biker uncle welded together in his garage lmao
That lowkey looks kinda stupid. 

It’s less of a throne and more of a... I don’t even know. A grocery store isle? 

Like, how the fuck is the king supposed to hear shit.

“M’lord, I have come to pledge my allegiance to you!”

“... WHAT?”

“I SAID I HAVE COME TO PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU!”

“YOU’VE COME TO DREDGE MY POLYNESIANS?”

“NO! PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE!” 

Or like, if an advisor wants to snarkily say something in the king’s ear, they gotta walk they ass all the way up there.
My theory was that because these swords had been forged together with dragonfire, they had became Valyrian steel, and that the eventual ruler would have to literally destroy the throne to arm their troops against the undead. 

Hasn't happened in the show. Maybe if he finishes the books it'll be in there.
Is there an edition of the book with some illustrations like this?  I'm half way through the 1st and really enjoying it but would love to get an image here and there.
Honestly...this is a concept that works better in a literary sense than a visual. HBO did a good job bringing the idea to film.
In the Fire and Blood he makes it clear that it was literally thousands of swords... the one in the show would be a couple hundred at best worth of metal
Cool as a concept, sure.  Still prefer the one on the show though.  This just looks a bit too ridiculous, imo.
My one issue with GRRM as a writer has always been scale.  Lengths of time, sizes of objects, etc.

He wrote a chair like that for kings to sit on a chair like that for thousands of years. He created a society would not develop technology to any extent in 10,000 years since the Age of Heroes, despite having similar intelligence to humans in our world. He created a Wall 700 feet high made entirely of ice, which is 30-40 times the size of the Great Wall in China.   Or that Westeros is the size not of Britain, but South America, and yet only has a few cities, and fights with armies of a couple thousand men.

Judging by GRRM's reaction to the size of the wall in the show, my guess would be that he does not have a very good grasp of scale when designing these things that he wanted to send impressive
Now that looks like 1000 swords
what are some other GRRM-accurate illustrations where the show is different?
I always found the visual image of the small council meetings in the book really funny because of the throne design. The monarch would be sitting on that monstrosity while everyone else would be seated at a seemingly normal table at the bottom. I image they’d be yelling all their conversations to each other so the monarch could hear.
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting

Time after time ♫
This is one instance where I prefer the show version, especially wrapped into the context of the throne being symbolic and largely narrative.
The Iron Throne is very very uncomfortable to sit on, and cuts many of the Kings who sit on it.

This picture is more accurate than the show, obviously.
that is way cooler
Isnt there also an image of what he was picturing Robert's carriage looked like when he took the trip up to Winterfell?

The thing was supposed to be thr size of a house or something like that.
I think he once said his vision of the Iron Throne is too big for any set.
He probably envisioned many things differently than HBO. I hope.
It would have been kinda cool to see it grow throughout the series, adding more after each battle.
I love this design. It looks so ugly and big and it shows power and madness. I also like the show version but it looks like a plastic chiar compared to this monstrosity.
Not sure if anyone's posted this yet but here's a great video of GRRM telling about how the Iron Throne should look a day talks a little about working with the artist to get it right. https://youtu.be/KHnpD0sbXZs
They could have added in Robert commenting how he had it redonr cause he hated walking all those steps
This is something just waiting for r/OSHA
"Back when dragon fire forged 100 million swords together"
I feel like this would be way more than a thousand swords
I'd never sit on that throne if I was king, I know I'd miss a step and impale myself with one of those swords lol
Gotta admit, I kinda imagined it like this too. Maybe not as big, but still looks more like it did in my head than the show.
Seems like a minor safety hazard
If I'd known the Iron Throne looked like that I wouldn't have scoffed at so many people fighting for it. That thing is fucking sword mountain.
What if you tripped
It was said that the throne was made without dulling the swords. So any king who were to be cut or injured but sitting on the throne would be deemed not worthy of it.
The show version is better imo.
One of my favorite flaws of Martin is how he consistently has a poor sense of scale. He’s always describing things to be crazy enormous to a degree that would be ludicrous IRL. I remember hearing that the Wall for the show was quite smaller than Martin had written it to be, yet when he saw it he asked why the made it so big

Another is his understanding of time - such as the millennia timeframe he has for Westeros. The Starks have had the North for well over 1000 years? Do you understand how fucking *long* that is? Name me one family who’s stayed royalty or nobility for that long (maybe there are some, I didn’t check, but seriously that is a long goddamned time)
Now THAT is 1,000 swords!   

(And also proof that authors should write books and showrunners should produce television shows.)
I am so amazed at how George managed to not just craft an entire world, but an entire history, cultures, and new lifestyles.  He made a whole existence. 

That is the true mark of a talented writer.
[removed]
I'll never understand the obsession. This thing looks hella uncomfortable.
Good thing they changed it. That's impractical and stupid af lol
OP is wrong, [this is the official and correct image.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/e/e5/Marc_Simonetti_Bran_theironthroneJoff.jpg)

>To Martin, the attempt closest to his vision was by French artist Marc Simonetti, for a Mexican edition of 1996's A Game of Thrones.[1][2][4][6][7] The author subsequently worked with Simonetti to get an image the author calls "absolutely right".[1] This depiction appears in Martin's 2014 companion book The World of Ice & Fire.[1][2][3] He noted, "From now on, THIS will be the reference I give to every other artist tackling a throne room scene."[2][3][8] Martin said of the image:

>This Iron Throne is massive. Ugly. Asymmetric. It's a throne made by blacksmiths hammering together half-melted, broken, twisted swords, wrenched from the hands of dead men or yielded up by defeated foes ... a symbol of conquest ... it has the steps I describe, and the height. From on top, the king dominates the throne room. And there are thousands of swords in it, not just a few. This Iron Throne is scary. And not at all a comfortable seat, just as Aegon intended.
That looks silly as hell
Wasn’t the throne described as 1000 swords melted together by dragon fire?
I wouldn’t be surprised if this is what it looks like in the next episode... the color I mean
That is much more impressive tbh
That's an accident waiting to happen. A drunk King wouldn't make it a week.
9/10 needs three more swords
its funny how the throne would cut people and it was considered a sign of unworthiness but now everyone can sit on it
