Confirming a helicopter crash.
https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1221514409056432128

The LA County Sheriff's department is confirming there was a helicopter crash in Calabasas and that 5 people have died but no names have been released yet so this is sounding very real.

Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the ~~plane~~ Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane.

Edit #2:  12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.

Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true.

Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter
I can’t believe it, the guy has flown in helicopters for years to travel around for games and now, right after the birth of his last daughter in the prime of his lifetime, it fails him :(. 

Terrible news

>The crash ignited a brush fire and made it difficult for firefighters and emergency personnel to get to the aircraft, he said. Sources at the scene said they believed there were multiple fatalities, but the exact number was unclear.

Holy shit. This can’t be true
Already up on their IG. TMZ does not fail in stuff like this and I'm just too realist to harbour hopes they have been hacked or something.

I'm speechless. Best I can say is condolences to the family. If today I'm an NBA fan is due to guys like him when I was growing up. Never rooted for the Lakers or him (but he was a joy to watch play, specially when he was in that zone), but nobody can deny he's one defining piece in NBA history. and his presence will be missed.

Rest in peace legend and champ.
Kobe’s camp would’ve already come out to deny this report.

This is awful.
Watching Vanessa accept Kobe’s HoF induction is going to be heartbreaking
TMZ are known to be reliable when it comes to celebrity stuff so I'm prepared for the worst.
I can't believe it dude. Kobe Bryant is dead. Fuck man. This is awful news.
[deleted]
Twitter turned off trending
I can’t believe this
Please tell me that's fake.

Edit: R.I.P
Jesus he just had another kid.
This is the worst I’ve ever felt about an athlete’s death. Fuck man
Wtf.....
[deleted]
I literally just re-watched his final 2016 game last night, and his final speech really resonated with me. He talked about how 20 years went by so fast, how his wife held the family down while he spent countless hours in the gym and he even cracked a joke about how his whole career people told him to pass, but tonight everyone said “Don’t pass it!” As he broke 60 points in his last game. Just made me think about how sometimes we put athletes in this realm in our heads of them not being real people, but they got just as much going on in their personal lives as we do. Rip
When you see the registration number on the aircraft that crashed it matches the reg number on the helicopter that Kobe frequently traveled in. So so so sad.
This is the first celebrity death that hit me hard. My grandmother passed away this morning as well... it's been the worst fucking day
Dude my sister called me about this. I can’t find any other reports. Please be a mistake. Anyone know if he was at the 76ers game last night?
I was just watching Kobe highlights last night. I don’t want to believe this.
I legitimately never really could comprehend why people would cry and get emotionally torn up when a celebrity/musician/athlete/an icon in their life passed away. Someone they never met.

For the past 30 years I’ve always been a Kobe Stan. All my basketball gear, workout clothes, jerseys, all Kobe. Went to his last game live and saw him score 60 with my saved up money. Always defended Kobe in any debate. As lame as it may sound, even in my darkest times in life I was able to pull through and be hopeful because I knew Kobe wouldn’t be down on himself in a time like this. Kobe was legitimately my idol. 

I understand now. This one really hurts.
This doesn't feel real.

Kobe is invincible.
He deserved to make a HOF speech, he deserved to be announced as part of the next top 50 NBA players, he deserved to see the Lakers win another ring later in his life, and present the trophy to them. He deserved to see grandchildren, the futures of all his girls, and live a great life, even for what he had already achieved. Rest in peace, Kobe.
No fucking way its true, the day after he passes the torch to Bron as #3? You couldnt write that shit
Damn man if it’s true its fucking crazy sad. His last tweet was him congratulating Lebron James. 
https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056?s=21
Man fuck...he was just congratulating Lebron last night. The guy is my idol, and this is soul crushing. I feel so bad for his family
[Woj Confirmed. Kobe's gone. RIP](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19)
The darkest day in basketball history
This is awful. His poor kids.
TMZ doesn't fuck up when it comes to these kinds of stories... what a terrible horrible surprise this is.
bro what the fuck
what the fuck...

edit: is this a fake report or something?

edit 2: TMZ is usually legit, but this is just...what the fuck.

edit 3: jesus fuck looks like it's real. Sorry to the Bryant family, and just what the hell. RIP Kobe
Holy shit guys??? Kobe RIP. Legitimately a legend. Wow I'm still shocked
Wait what the fuck
This shit better not be true
Dang I’ve never been shaken by a celebrity death before, but this is something else. RIP Kobe, you’ll be missed.
[deleted]
At least he was comfortable with death 


https://www.theringer.com/2016/11/11/16087158/kobe-bryant-lakers-interview-retirement-shoes-death-36f099f28196
WTF
Wow, this gives a pit stomach feeling.
No way this is real. I refuse to believe it is. After Lebron passes him for third all time? This is so heartbreaking to the sports world. My heart literally dropped at reading this headline.
This is horrible news to hear 

Rip to one of the goats
Who else grew up shouting KOBE whenever throwing anything ;( 

RIP
The NBA should cancel one game for every team so everyone only plays 81 games. RIP, Mamba
https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1221514409056432128?s=19

La County Sherrifs confirm 5 dead at a helicopter crash.
Gone before he even got indicted into the HOF. Just an all around tragedy for everyone involved and their families. Life is precious, hug your loved ones.
NO IT CANT BE TRUE
I know no one is gonna read this but this hurts more than any other former player death would. Kobe is the reason I started watching basketball. I remember being a little kid watching the playoffs with my dad and thinking Kobe was the coolest guy in the world. I’m gonna miss him so much
RIP
I'm shaking what the fuck
Who tf buys the “yas queen” and “made me smile” awards for this. Go to hell.
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to comprehend this headline
This like, doesn’t feel real? Wtf I hope it’s fake but it’s being reported more and more. Fuck I’m speechless. I’ve never been shocked more by news
This is just horrid. Never got to give his HOF speech. An all time legend. Induct him immediately NBA. Retire 8 and 24. RIP to possibly the best ever.
Every now and then I'll sort by top all-time and still can't believe what's at the top.
I’m going to choose to believe that after getting passed by LeBron, Kobe has decided to fake his death and use anti-aging technology to come back to the league. This can’t be real.
LA TIMES reported a helicopter crash 1 hour ago. That much is legit. The helicopter is also the same as Kobe’s.
To everyone who's wondering how to deal with this news: Realize life has an end and it may come anytime. Stop postponing things and live each day to the fullest.
wow

this is surreal............like one of those i'll remember where i was moments 

helicopters are death traps .........

RIP 

feel awful for his daughters, especially the one who'll never get to know him
Tmz doesnt report fake deaths. God damn RIP
He was just tweeting yesterday :(((
No way.  What the fuck?
TMZ crashed their site and it says "Technical Difficulties"

Please be fake...
Hard to comprehend. He shaped basketball for my generation. He was fun to root for, and often even more fun to root against. The outpouring of love that is about to descend on his legacy is going to be remembered for a long, long time.
Kobe was supposed to be the Bill Russell grandfather figure of the NBA in 30 years. Mentoring young players, showing up to Finals games and Allstar games getting a ton of applause, handing out awards. Completely at peace having accomplished everything he set out to do in life. That’s just how it was supposed to be, period. There’s no way he is supposed to be gone like this. This is the absolute saddest moment in the history of the NBA. I’ll never forget the headline of this thread and how utterly alien it looked as I read it over and over.
The last 24 hours I haven't stopped thinking about the loss of Kobe, and how I could be this emotional for losing someone I've never met. I've wondered if I'm being selfish for feeling pain when I know it can't compare to what the other families are experiencing right now. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not crazy and this isn't selfish. 


A generation grew up knowing who Kobe was — the near perfect combination of extreme talent mixed with unwavering determination. Whether you're an NBA fan and saw him on the TV in your living room every week for nearly two decades or only heard about him winning his numerous titles casually, I think we all knew of his trademark Mamba Mentality. He preached about the importance of practice, setting aside the necessary time to perfect one's craft, and bettering yourself every day in order to achieve your goals. 


Our generation is now attempting to achieve those goals. We got our university degrees and certifications, we've landed our first or second career job, and many of us are trying or beginning to start a family of our own. Somehow it feels like a distant uncle, someone we idolized from afar, someone who told us to believe in ourselves throughout our childhood, was taken from this earth without notice. It's a sad day. 


Hopefully what I've written down can help you understand the sadness you may feel too. I know it's helped me.
"Five people confirmed deceased, no survivors in #Calabasas helicopter crash. #LASD #Malibu deputies remain with #LA County Fire personnel. Investigation ongoing. "

Avoid the area until further notice.

When I was 8 years old I got my first basketball video game (NBA Inside Drive 2004). The only player I knew at the time was Shaq, so my first few games were played as the Lakers.

After playing I got to know the names of the other players, and I found out there was a “Bryant” on the team. I didn’t know this was *the* Kobe Bryant, but I liked the name Bryant so I usually passed him the ball cause Shaq was terrible when shooting and dribbling.

As I played more games I got to be really good with Bryant, and soon I figured that you could edit the stats of the players. So I turned Kobe’s up to 99 for everything and went to town on the other teams. 

Kobe scored over 450 points in one game. I’d steal the ball, go outside the 3 point line, shoot a fade-away and then steal the ball on the inbounds pass. Rinse and repeat.

That process happened so quickly, the announcer wouldn’t even have time to finish saying “Kobeeeeeee Bryyyyaaaant!” Because by the time he got to the “Bryyyy” part I’d have already made another 3. 

Time went on and I eventually learned that the Bryant I was playing as was *the* Kobe Bryant. I was kind of a dumb 8 year old.

It makes me sad that the first NBA player I really liked is gone.
Who the fuck gave the yas queen award? Fuckin muppet
I don't care if someone hits a game 7 finals buzzer beater game winner. This post should stay top post of all time forever. Such a tragedy we should remember forever
The people that gave this post a "Yaas Queen" and "Made me Smile" awards are pieces of shit, and whenever they die the whole world will smile.
Raptors first possession they let they shot clock expire to honour #24. Then the Spurs did it.
Still can't believe you're gone :'(
This is absolutely crazy
I’m trying to process why Kobe’s death is earth shattering. 

It has something to do with the fact that he’s the first NBA superstar to die. Before Jordan. Before Kareem. Hell, before Magic and Larry! 

Damn. What do GOAT discussions look like when the person is dead?! 

Condolences to the Bryant Family.
This is going to be the darkest week in NBA history
What kind of fucked up timeline are we living in where Kobe fucking Bryant dies dude wtf man fuck this
https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=20

Woj just dropped the news and confirmed it. So very tragic
RIP, loved to hate him in the 2000s, but he was certainly a legend.
Wow, this might be the first time in my young life that a celebrity death has gotten to me. I legit loved watching him for years as a kid until adulthood. This hits right in the feels.
And this after Leicester City FC lost their owner in a helicopter crash last year. The worst method of transportation.
Confirmed by Kobe's family. 
https://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/1221520549706444801

R.I.P.
Let’s hope the ABC reporter confused “survived by his 4 daughter”
Yelling “Kobe” after shooting a basketball shot is going to hit a little different now
One of my students who lives in LA said that a mother and daughter who went to his (the student’s) school also died in the crash. She played basketball with Kobe’s daughter. Then I’d imagine the 5th was the pilot. 

So it seems it would be Kobe, GiGi, Unnamed Mother and daughter, and the pilot
The terror of realizing moments before crashing that you and your daughter are going to die..condolences to his fam.
Kobe was above the NBA, and even basketball. He was an ambassador for sports across the entire globe. He was a pillar of an entire culture that bled into music, arts, black identity, American identity, and beyond.

Honestly one of the most shocking deaths in a long time.
I can’t sleep. My heart aches knowing that Gianna couldn’t live her life, and that her father couldn’t enjoy his retirement and accomplish all the thing he wanted after basketball. Fuck man. I hate this.
Not the black mamba man, dude has enjoying his life after retiring so sad.
TMZ also reporting :

**Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.**

**We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.**

Kobe Bryant died in a helicoper crash in Calabasas Sunday morning ... TMZ Sports has confirmed.

Kobe was traveling with at least 3 other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out. Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board.
I first saw this on a restaurant sign as I was driving back into town. They always have lame jokes on the sign and I spent a few minutes wondering how '8   24   RIP Kobe' was supposed to be funny

RIP everyone lost today
I just realized we won't be able to hear his Hall of Fame speech or see him unveil his Lakers statue outside Staples Center. I can't fucking take this, man. 💔
The sheriff just announced that there were 9 people killed on board.
Just saw an ABC news report that the weather was so poor for flying this am, no LAPD helicopter was cleared to fly 

It seems so senseless that kobe's pilot would take off in those conditions 

Similar thing happened with JFK jr's plane crash - bad weather
If true this is gonna take me months or even years to process, doesn't seem real at all. Dude was only 41. This is about to be the biggest thread in /r/nba history
Gonna get buried under the thousands of comments but love is really the most important thing there is. We are never truly in control so lets appreciate every moment we have here and try to be as loving as possible to everyone.
This can’t be real.
This will go down as the most popular and the most tragic post in r/nba history.

I thought all the "RIP Kobe" posts were referring to his place on the all-time scoring ladder. Fucking nuts.
Wtf people like him can’t just go and die at 41. And in a helicopter crash of all!? After everything his done, all the work he put in, just to have it ripped away at 41. He should’ve been waddling into a game at 90 years old and a kid should’ve been asking his grandfather who that Bryant guy was that the camera kept panning over to. Just what the fuck man.
[deleted]
Man I miss you.
This cannot be real 😭😭
Please please please dont be true
As nutty as r/NBA can get, I think we can all agree that this is a got damn shame.
Yo fuck helicopters...
Jay William's on espn talking about kobe. "Just tell the loved ones you have, you love them. No matter what problems you have big or small. You just gotta let that shit go." He apologized and the anchors on ESPN just told him dude you are fine l. Its okay.
I genuinely cannot believe this. First celebrity death that's actually made me sad. How is this possible?
https://www.radarbox24.com/data/registration/N72EX
Man we never got a hall of fame speech by Kobe... this is so messed up
TMZ updated their page, his oldest daughter GiGi was also on board. They were going to her basketball practice. :(
TMZ has reported his daughter Gianna was also onboard. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/
To honor Kobe the Spurs and Raptors both let the 
**24** second shot clock run out on their first possessions. 
Any more stories about how he was honored today?

RIP Kobe Bryant

4th highest all-time NBA scorer - 33,643

5× NBA champion (2000–2002, 2009, 2010)

Rest in Peace Kobe...
I had a shit ton of discord notification that I woke up to saying RIP Kobe from basketball discords I forgot about or haven't muted. I assumed they were simply referencing that LeBron passed his on scoring last night. Never would have imagined that it was something like this. So sad.

Still breaks my heart.
Just stopping by to pay my respects one last time before this post gets archived.
Thank you Kobe Bryant. You taught me so much and I'm going to miss you a lot. I'm shocked by your sudden, early passing and I grieve for your friends and family. 

I'm so grateful for your time and energy and everything you brought to me and this world. We didn't always agree and you didn't know me, but I knew a public version of you and I grew to love and respect you for who you were as a genuine individual. You were a special, special talent on the court and everywhere. You were a leader and an innovator who brought so much joy to people's lives. I learned so much from you about basketball, competing, purpose, motivation, balance, self respect, ego, toughness, teamwork, just life... Thank you for sharing yourself with me and the world. It was a true honor. I will carry your lessons with me into the world and a part of my energy will be in honor of yours. Much love.
No no no nooo

what the FUCK
Literally sick to my stomach right now
This is not a headline i thought i would scroll across today. Wtf
I’m starting to think helicopters are not the way to go for short convenient trips. A couple of years ago the Leicester City FC owner died flying from his stadium after a match.  Rip
Helicopter crash confirmed fatalities R.I.P to whoever that was on board, to him or not. 

Fuck his last tweet was to LeBron telling him to move the game forward. He has to for sure now 🌹🌹💐💐
his poor wife. Fuck. That ain’t fair man
Just confirmed his 13 year old was with him Rip.
TMZ confirmed one other passenger was confirmed, John Altobelli. I would assume his daughter, 12 or 13 year old Alyssa Altobelli, who [according to this article](https://2paragraphs.com/2019/10/lakers-coach-says-kobe-bryants-daughter-young-killa-in-the-making/) has played with 'Gigi' Bryant in the past, was the other passenger, as they were headed to practice together.

Now here's the thing. Kobe has been known to fly his own helicopters. Whether or not he was the pilot is yet to be confirmed. If he is, I imagine another member of the Altobelli family was involved.

Alyssa Altobelli is in [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgVg4JFXsN/?utm_source=ig_embed).
This is gonna be the top all-time /r/NBA post and it just fills me with so much sadness.
2020 can go suck a shaq sized dick
This still doesn’t feel real y’all. What a horrible day.
R.I.P Gianna ❤️❤️❤️
Never been more affected by an athlete/celebrity/icon’s death. Still in shock. Feeling absolutely heartbroken. Rest easy to him and his daughter, and remembering the legacy he left behind.
Woke up this morning hoping yesterday was a bad dream.
Man I'll go a while without thinking about this but then something reminds me of it and then I'm in disbelief all over again.
I don’t think Kobe being dead will ever feel normal for me. I get hazey thinking about it.
Just found myself stumbling through Kobe highlight videos on YouTube; something I haven't done in a while. When they showed all of these montages of him taking over late in games and icing wins, they showed clips from the end of his last game and I just started crying. It was more of a good cry - like this man was doing this through his entire career, and this motherfucker is really out here hitting 19 food fadeaways to seal a game, and dropping 60 points while doing so. This man was something else, I tell ya.
Still can’t believe it he’s really gone
Nope. A month later and still sad...RIP KOBE+GiGi
What
Please be fake
[Charania] The NBA has suspended its season.

china finally did it... NBA is canceled... all for a tweet
RUDY WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO
Timeline of events and context

* 2 days ago the NBA, alongside the MLB, MLS, and NHL, announced they would be limiting access to locker rooms and players as a precautionary measure against Covid-19

https://twitter.com/JeffZillgitt/status/1237149481872883714?s=19

* Utah Jazz player and French national Rudy Gobert, that same day, seemingly mocked the precaution by making it a point to touch all of the microphones and other media equipment at a post-game press conference that same day

https://streamable.com/o2eju

* 2 days later (today) Rudy Gobert is listed as "questionable" with an illness on the official injury report

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fh3kdl/heck_rudy_gobert_is_questionable_with_an_illness/

* Right as the Utah Jazz game against the Oklahoma City Thunder is set to play a team doctor runs out on court, confers with officials, and the game is abruptly cancelled

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fh7m67/post_game_thread_the_utah_jazz_4123_the_oklahoma/

* We immediately find out Rudy Gobert has tested positive for Covid-19

https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1237913057596026881

* And now the NBA has suspended the entire season.
Quick. Probably the right call. Damn.
Guys.  Take care of yourselves, and your families.

You know this is real when these owners agree to give away this kind of money.  

The experts have been sounding the alarm bells for weeks, if not months.  Some of us have been living in denial.

Take reasonable steps to take care of yourselves, whatever your individual situation may be.
Coronavirus named DPOY.
I HAVE NOTHING IN LIFE!!!!

Fuck this stupid ass motherfucking bullshit. Just when the bucks were getting good
Who do we declare champions?
RUDY GOBERT SINGLE HANDILY BEAT EVERY TEAM INCLUDING HIS OWN
#GOBERT WITH THE BLOCK
Rudy Gobert will never touch a microphone again. Every time he takes a free throw some fan will have a giant sign of a mic. Can’t wait.
Woj in shambles for not delivering the Corona bomb.
SPURS KEEPING THEIR PLAYOFF STREAK ALIVE.
the NBA has been eliminated from playoff contention.
GOBERT TO THE GUILLOTINE
Everyone get in here
The league took intricate procedures to contain this and some moron goes and touches every mic before getting tested positive. Just great.
Can you imagine Lebron in the playoffs after a couple months off?
WHAT IS HAPPENING
#HOLY SHIT OFF-SEASON SHITPOSTS EARLY
Paul George thought he took a vaccine for COVID-19 but turns out it was just a bad shot.
Raptors champs for more than 1 season.
I fucking hate 2020
GOBERT IS DPOY BUT HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM AINT
LeBron misses the playoffs 2 years in a row for the first time in his career
RAPS SUSTAIN THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP RUN


where were you wen NBA die?

i was at house browsing reddit and saw 

"Season is kil”

“no"
NOOO fuck 2020
[Curb Your NBA Season](https://streamable.com/qhxng)
I know a lot of you are young, but you realize suspended isn’t canceled, right?
This is all feels so surreal man.. I haven’t felt right since the end of October when my Dad tragically passed out of the fucking blue. I can’t even talk about it with the closet people in my life or even begin to process it myself. Typing it out feels so wrong. Like I literally can’t even think about it I’ve blocked so much out and compartmentalized so much shit but I just wanted to write this out. And then in early January my close friend killed himself and again I can barely even began to think about that. I just turned 24 and all this shit just feels so wrong like I’m living in this nightmare I can’t wake up from but I’m trying my hardest to stay positive. Idk I’m rambling but this is just.... idk what’s going on..
GOBERT KILLED THE FUCKING LEAGUE.
LMAO SPURS FANS ARE REJOICING
Fuck the Lakers Lol
 **Thank you to the NBA - in suspending your season you showing leadership by example, putting the health of players and fans above profits, and generally showing care and concern for our society.**
yOu CaNt GeT cOvId FrOm ToUcHiNg MiCs
Lebron really not going to get another ring because of Rudy
All these comments so no one will read I'm not gay I just think guys kiss better
HELLO FRONT PAGE
DPOY can’t even defend his immune system
Max Kellerman on Lebron: "It's called selling out. It's very easy to take a stand when there is low to no cost. When there is a real price to pay, then who will stand up? Mohammad Ali did. Not Lebron James"

Mohammad Ali is the perfect example. Dude lost years of his prime over protesting what he thought was right. I mean, shit, he took it to the US Supreme Court since he was the one with the money and could afford to take a stance against the US Government.
Lemme guess, SAS took the "shut up and get your paper up" route again?

And Max Kellerman throwing left and right hooks. This is the Max I liked before he went to ESPN.
Wtf I love Max now
Max Kellerman redemption arc in full swing
Wow I’m surprised ESPN is even allowing anyone to say this lol
Max has gotten so many damn points for his stances on this shit, I'm amazed how good this dude has made himself look.
Max a real one. His takes have been legit throughout this story.
I think what others are forgetting, or not seeing is that LeBron's choice of words echo official Party opinion. By describing the tweet as misinformed or uneducated, he is feeding into the CCP's propaganda machine. He is either a useful idiot parroting what he was told, or choosing these words in an intentional dog whistle in order to preserve his income/opportunity in the China market.
Thank God u cut the clip before SAS spouted out whatever bs he had in mind. I get that people watch him as a joke, for entertainment, but I can't stand the guy, even as a meme. His takes can be so bad at times, even when it comes to basketball
Max is the real deal
LeHypocrite
LeBron. You a bitch.
people in nba who've taken a stand against china:

morey ✔️

enes ✔️

lebron x

harden x

tillman x

kerr (undecided)

bennett (unreachable)
Max was right for once.
So much respect for Kellerman right now. Hate all you want about his sports takes( i sure do ) but the courage that he showed with all this, i see him a totally different light now.
Tomorrow: *Max Kellerman has been let go from ESPN. All hail the CCP.*
Athletes all want to celebrate Kaepernick but none want to be him.
Kellerman and Cain are the only voices of reason on the whole China bullshit relative to all the pathetic shilling ESPN and the NBA are doing for that despotic regime.
Max Kellerman with the half court buzzer beater for the win


Ali stood up.  Kaep took a stand by kneeling.  Bron just let it be known nothing messes with his $$$$
I’ve been a LeBron fan my entire life. I’ll admit, I’ve had days when it’s hard to support him, but Jesus Christ this man is officially a joke. Fuck him. Fuck the lakers. Fuck the league. And most of all...

#FUCK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
Goodbye Taco Tuesday, Hello Wanton Wednesday!
r/nba sides with Kellerman over LeBron, we live in a cursed fucking timeline
Kellerman is the man on what's he's said on all this.  Moved up to my fav commentator
I can already hear what ugly ass SAS is gonna say, fucking rat.

Edit: [here's what the rat said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2923L1bJBw)
Not of fan of Kellerman and his flatulent takes, but he's been surprisingly great during this entire saga.
Lebron really didn’t have much to lose though. Ali did. Social justice is less impressive when it’s easy to stand up for and public opinion is on your side. Just my opinion though. To each his own.
BIG BALLED MAX KELLERMAN FROM THE TOP ROPE. MAMA THERE SPEAKS THAT MAN.
I really liked the 1st part, and then the 2nd part where the video ends when SAS is about to talk.
god, I'm glad I didn't hear Stephan A's bitch ass.
Followed up by Stephen A bringing race into it
MAX IS TALKIN FAX
Steven Smith sounds like a slave owner from the 1800's. How could you possibly give lebron's statement a 'stand by it 1000%'.
So the lesson here is that stuff is only a problem when your not making a buck off it.
This whole situation is sad and hilarious at the same time.
Lebron has finally cemented his status as the GOAT... Goof of all time.
Lets get this to the top post all time of r/nba folks

[deleted]
Wow this is honestly just such an unbelievably bad look for Lebron. Pathetic is the only word that comes to mind.
Max sharting on Bron/China this week
Guys you don’t understand how LeQing was hurt physically and spiritually by that tweet!
So true. 

Lebron talked about how Morey tweeted without thinking of others and only thinking of himself, which is unbelievably backwards: Morey’s tweet was completely focused on others and their suffering while Lebron’s statement was wholly self-centered.
Max Kellerman a real one for this
\#FreeHongKongFuckLeBron.
LeBron is so afraid of saying the *wrong* thing that he refuses to just say what his values are and let the chips fall where they may. The very same behavior he has criticized so many for when it was an issue that mattered to him.

Nobody needs a politician here LeBron, they need you as a role model to just say what you believe whether its the perfect thing to say or not, because THAT is what is important.

Nobody learns anything from hiding. You say what you believe in, and ask honest questions about what you dont know about, and everyone has a chance to grow and learn.

Hiding to try and protect your brand is the EXACT thing that will devalue it and make you look like a cheap phony. It weakens your stance on *everything*, even the things you do know a lot about and want to champion. It's just a weak move to not say what you think. Accept the possibility that you can be wrong or ill-prepared or less informed, because that is the only way you can grow. Nobody says the right thing every time, but I can guarantee you that trying to say nothing is almost always the wrong move. You rob others of a chance to hear a powerful opinion, or on the other hand rob yourself of a chance to learn and be humbled.

Some things are bigger than basketball, and even bigger than a single important event. Some things set a precedent for how a platform is used for *all* events going forward. Dont set the example that you hide from things and only support causes for things that you can see yourself in, because that is not how any type of unity spreads. Expand your horizons, and stand up for your values. Especially when it is difficult and you aren't so positively sure that you're right. That is when it is most important to discuss things.
Or in the immortal words of the female Warriors fan, "Lebron, how does it feel to be a pussy-ass bitch?"
Lmao now everyone loves LeBron again lmao you love to see it
Max is a real motherfucker for this.
You done fucked up now, L-E-Bron.
Fuck the NBA and every player that sides with them. 

LeBron is a coward and a sellout.
Wait for this to sink to no. 2

Imagine bill russell doing what lebron did. What a colossal jackass lebron is
This show has gotten so much better than it was when Skip was on. It's still not my cup of tea, but I've got a lot of respect for Max. He's been one of the only ESPN analysts to not back down from this issue. I wish so bad that Dan Le Batard wasn't away on his honeymoon. He wouldn't have backed down from this topic either.
Kellerman’s fart was the prelude to him shitting on LeBron
You know who didn’t defend China in a tweet? The greatest basketball player of all time. Michael Jordan. Checkmate.
LeBron "I believe in freedom of speech until you touch my wallet" James
Amazing. Max Kellerman has two spots in the top 10 all time posts and has surpassed Shitgate.
As someone from Hong Kong, I’m so glad that there are people in the US who would be willing to stand out to speak for us! It just turns out that person is not LeBron James.
[lol](https://i.redd.it/q83fy8h2vp141.jpg) 

And as I predicted, one month later, nobody cares.

White people hated Ali and discredited his views when he went against US propaganda, and now it's happening all over again. Years from now, this will either be completely forgotten about, or LeBron will be proven to have been in the right all along. You guys are pathetic.
Holy shit the balls to say this on ESPN, Mad respect.
Max Kellerman you’ve earned yourself a fan
Steven A's response to this was ridiculous. He said that everyone that is still working at ESPN is a sellout because they haven't quit their job yet because people should consider who they work for when speaking out on these issues. Basically encapsulating Max's argument. Thank you Steven A for beautifully illustrating Max's point.
Ali sat in prison for 4 fucking years, there is zero comparison here.  I have spoken to anyone I can get ahold of face to face and nobody is talking about China, I don't know who to believe, the bots on reddit or my friends who live in hong kong and are here for university.  Reddit has a hardon for China right now while the rest of the world is burning and I don't understand why.
lol at Stephen A. Smith adjusting after his asshole puckered up from having to respond to this.
Max Kellerman has fully redeemed himself for that fart.
Friendship with LeBron is over! Max is my new best friend!
GOES TO SHOW THAT MUHAMMAD ALI STAYS THE GREATEST!

PUT SOME FUCKING RESPECT ON THAT NAME.
I lost a lot of respect for Lebron for this move.  Lakers Lebron is definitely my least favorite Lebron.
america is shocked that their star athletes don't want to "stand up" against the cpc. there are two things happening here that don't get talked about.

first: not all americans understand exactly why mainland china is behaving this way. they don't understand that history, the people, the economics and the unlimited will that mainland china has. i'm not agreeing with mainland china, but many americans don't get them. i don't understand either. what americans do understand is that they are witnessing their own citizens not speaking out and that is a shock.

second: americans are maybe subconsciously taking this out on nba stars when in fact what is at stake here is americas thought leadership in the world. when was the last time another country was upset at something america did and who in america actually cared. there is a comfort in being on top and being unchallenged. now there are hints that power is shifting. now america has to actually watch what they do because they will have consequences that they will not be able to overcome so easily with economic and military might.

freedom of speech and expression should win out. what we are seeing with the nba is a hyper focus on what is going to become more and more external influence on american view of the world and its hard to say what will happen.
I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.
Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

e. haha well this bl**e**w up. Just wanted to take the opportunity to say how much I appreciate r/NBA for being the best fucking sub on this site (**d**espite y'all nephews calling my boy *hitler*), than**k**s to all my fellow redditors for t**h**e nice words and the ridiculous amount of gold.
Here is Darren Rovell from the Action Network tweeting about it: https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1192513721014345729
I don’t even watch NBA but this sub cracks me up all the time.
Dude show this to Morey immediately
>Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my work cpu...   
  
he may lose his job but he's getting a ton of karma. this man's priorities are in order.
The math tells us what we always knew:

&nbsp;

Harden's stats drop from MVP level when he drops stacks from the VIP level.
Every team has to increase investments in strip clubs in case they meet the Rockets in the playoffs
[deleted]
dude, you gotta [OC] this stuff
Man, fuck 538, *this* is the sabermetrics we need to know
and i think we found the post of the year
Ironic that Canadian ballet is the term for strip clubs, yet Toronto has evidently the worst strip clubs
this is like Billy Beane level genius. TittyBall
This is quality offseason content I like it
Have advanced stats gone too far?
[deleted]
ESPN picking this up in 3, 2, 1...
This is the greatest piece of journalism I think I’ve ever read
This is literally the best sports sub on reddit
I feel like you’ve found the way to convince Charles Barkley to buy in to analytics
You have my attention. But also if you’re just doing it based off total # of poor performances over the last 4 years wouldn’t western cities have an advantage due to more matchups? Does that make his high amount of poor performances in Miami that more significant?

Edit: OP did good maths but chart title a little confusing
As an Atlantan, I choose to ignore all your methodology that went into deciding that Miami has the best strip clubs. Magic City and Cheetah til I die.
[deleted]
Daryl Morey would like to know your location
Daryl Morey night actually hire you if/when he sees this.
is r=.46 strong enough to be conclusive?
Does Westbrook allow him to visit stripclubs though?
How does toronto have the worst strip clubs? Youd think with the diversity there youd get a little taste of everything depending what youre looking for
I'm here for history
Wait until Vegas gets a team
Bruh, what are your control variables?  You're going to need to control for average player performance in that city.  For example, every player may be worse in Denver and Utah due to altitude.   Also control for distance traveled from Houston.  Also control for back-to-backs.  Also control for the quality of the team (maybe opposing team record). Those are the first 4 that came to mind but you can't being drawing conclusions from univariate tests.
We know his weakness, now how do we use it?
Hey bro they’re talking about your research right now this very second on 97.1 The Ticket radio!!!
Less about Kawhis Load

More Harden and Strip Clubs
You can’t just use correlation coefficients and make determinations based off them. Any confounding variables would make the results of your correlation coefficient pretty much useless. This data doesn’t mean much without proper regression performed & the appropriate model assumption tests done. Not to mention that the google rating of city strip clubs may not be the best measure of determining if they have “good” strip clubs.

Source - am statistician
Isn’t r^2 of 0.21 rather low?
This is the greatest reddit post of all time, all subs, bar none.
Wonder how Steph does in cities with the ladies with the best feet
I love this post so much. This is quality content
This is beyond science
James ‘Hard’en 😏
I can see Hasan Minhaj directly quoting this quality content on his show
I laughed pretty hard when you said you googled 30+ strip clubs on your work computer. This is quality work
I was there at the beginning but I didn’t comment FUCK. 

With that being said greatest post of all time and it’s not even close.
Shut your mouths, James Harden runs a non-profit that puts young women through college. The rest is slander.
I would fucking love to be in the locker room when his teammates talk about this haha.
I don't know, if you've never been to Toronto you shouldnt be saying they have the worst strip clubs
This dude just got 4.5 years of reddit premium for his work.

So much sadness for every grieving parent today. This is horrifying.
Sandy Hook was 10 years ago this December.

The kids killed at Sandy Hook were 6 and 7.  This December, they would still be in high school.  They wouldn't have graduated until the following school year.
Death toll just rose from 14 to 21 by the way. Including 18 children.

I feel like, as a nation, we've collectively erased the memory of Las Vegas 2017.
Dan Hodges [tweet from 2015](https://mobile.twitter.com/dpjhodges/status/611943312401002496?lang=en):

> In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.
I did not know that 90% of Americans support background checks. I looked up it, and it's true. According to [this Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx), 92% of Americans support background check on all gun sales.

https://i.imgur.com/QgISgtU.png

Edit: And 77% of Republican voters support H.R. 8, the bill Kerr was talking about (Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.) https://www.newsweek.com/77-gop-voters-support-background-checks-gun-buyers-dems-push-forward-bill-1575449

This [study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-1590) says 78% of guns transfers had background checks, 22% did not have background check. (Current federal law only requires background check through licensed arms dealers, not private transactions.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_background_check
I have more confidence that the Mavs will come back from an 0-3 deficit to win than I do that our government will do anything out of this tragedy.
KERR/POPOVICH 2024
Kerr’s own father was shot and killed while he was serving as president of the American University of Beirut, so this has to really be hitting home for him. He’s saying what so many of us are feeling right now.

If people want change, they need to vote those in congress who continue to do nothing out.
He has every right to be pissed as do we all
I’m right there with you Steve
18 in Austin

24 in Kileen

14 at Fort Hood

27 in Sutherland Springs

10 in Santa Fe

23 in El Paso

18 in Uvalde

and those are just the double digit ones. 

It's been 56 years since a man went up in that tower at the University of Texas and nothing has meaningfully changed.
I love the “I’m tired of condolences and moments of silence”

More action. Much respect to Kerr.
Shoutout Kerr but his question "Are you (politicians) going to put your own desire for power over the lives of our children?"

The answer has been and will continue to be yes. I don't ever see that changing. We are cooked as a country
Many say that when someone like Steve Kerr speaks up that he should just shut up and do his job.  Maybe if our leaders in Washington did their damn jobs regular citizens like him  he wouldn't have to say things like this.  Anyone who doesn't feel the exact same things that he does in this speech are just part one of the BIGGEST damn problems this country has ever had.
You can see the pain in his face.

Those aren't empty words. 

We have to do something.
Love my coach and hate seeing him like this. He's feeling what most of us are feeling. It's never gonna end.
Literally every time I see a mass shooting headline, I always think of the onion article “no way to prevent this, says only country where this happens regularly”. 

It’s even more numbing knowing that absolutely nothing will get done as long as republicans can block this legislation from happening.
In tears man. Those poor kids, those poor families. This country is so completely broken.
I'm sure it hits him even harder considering what happened to his dad. Just a terrible day
Saying it how it is. Good shit Steve
>	calls out senators to take action.

Some of those clowns are saying a woman that gets raped an impregnated by their uncle should be forced to give birth…they don’t give a fuck about someone else’s kids or someone else’s kids getting murdered if it means votes for them
Don’t know why but this made me tear up a few times. Thank you Steve, for always being a voice of reason, someone that uses their platform for good. 

Shame on US politics for allowing this country to fail. In every aspect of life!
Well shit, I guess I'm a Warriors fan now, because I love this man and this message. To me, this moment breaks the typical cycle we are all used to:

1. mass shooting
2. thoughts and prayers
3. Presidential damnation and condolences
4. moments of silence at sporting events, flags at half-mast
5. repetitive pundit comments on the repetitiveness of the situation
6. memorials
7. charities established in the tragedy's name
8. calls for gun control legislation
10. faux bewilderment and outrage from conservatives about the sanctity of the second amendment
11. lack of control legislation
12. another mass shooting

He jumped in at four and called out some of the rest that's sure to come. I applaud him for it. It won't change anything, of course. He's right, but the senators he's talking about have already told and shown us that they give zero fucks. Conservatives stay in power by opposing gun control legislation - that's the end of the story. They will forever oppose it in any form.
Kerr and Pop always nail it whenever they talk about these types of tragedies
We don't need moments of silence, we need to talk. Steve is spot on.
Not my line, but as others have said, after Sandy Hook, when people in this country decided it was okay to let kids die rather than enforce stricter gun control, the debate was over. This is just another example.
"After a tragedy like this is not the time to make it political" well good thing we have a mass shooting every week so we can never talk about it. I'm as fed up as Steve
He aint wrong. 

I know we can't get a full ban - let's take steps to reign in gun violence due to access to guns

It's easier to stop gun violence by a mentally ill person when there's stricter gun laws than it is to stop gun violence by a mentally ill person when there's easy access to guns. 

We make everyone jump through hoops to get a driver's license - a written test, classes, training, then a hands on test. Why not do the same for guns?
As A confused Canadian, what I don't get is, what's the hold up with background checks?


It seems like that's pretty standard thing that really wouldn't affect the majority of gun owners anyways. Also if the reason is more mental health, wouldn't ot make sense to strengthen mental health supports?
All facts, powerful words

But it's 52 senators

Can't let manchin and sinema off the hook
How a motherfucker can buy a couple assault rifles before he can buy a couple beers is something I'll never understand. Not even a week ago, they just let him obtain this shit.

Laws aside, what exactly does one legally need an assault rifle for? "Hunting"???
Over in /r/conservative they’re really upset at the lack of mental health help in the United States.
I will always respect Kerr for his beliefs and where he stands politically. Canadian here that is dumbfounded that mass shootings are still a weekly occurence in the US. Broken political system, broken social net, broken ethics (and fuck the NRA).
The NRA continues to drive the senate. Totally preventable.
Kerr never misuses his platform, his ability to channel what I’m feeling basically all the time is uncanny, and I want to scream in anger and despair with him. This country is so wildly broken. Love to you, man.
We need congressional term limits. That'll be a huge step in the right direction so that elected officials are incentivized to help their constituents instead of doing what they can to remain in power.
Love this man's social responsibility. Go Kerr.
guy was on the verge of tears, damn i feel so helpless
I just can’t get past the dread that nothing is going to change 

It’s been nearly 10 years since sandy hook iirc

is it going to be another 10 years of this? or more? it sure fucking feels like it.
i’m an aussie and honestly how tf do you guys deal with living in the US? 
- the absolute shitstorm that is congress 
- a horrendous lack of gun control
- a minimum wage that you would give to an ant
- the worst health care system in the developed world. 
- horrendous division between political parties and ethnic groups

in my life, i have not seen ONE mass shooting in Australia. we had a major one in 1996, and not too long after that, essentially ALL guns were banned and the only way to get them legally took so long that it wasn’t worth the hassle. so many americans claim that the US is the ‘best country in the world’ yet this is the sort of shit that happens. fucking hell. as i mentioned earlier, your 2 major political parties HATE each other, in Australia, that may be true, but they can still agree on basic principles, and, for the most part, actually care about the people and value the general public as opposed to just the loyal group of supporters that will always vote for them. the whole system in the US needs drastic reform so this shit can never happen again.
Always liked Steve Kerr as a person
Fuck Moscow Mitch and the GOP
I’m proud of our coach. Truly a great guy and great leader.
Conservatives, don’t tell me you’re “pro-life” while children are being shot in school. Those kids deserve protection while in the womb, but not in math class? Fuck you
- Regular mass shootings  
- unlivable minimum wage  
- lack of universal health care  

As an Australian, I hate seeing how people in the USA are constantly gaslighted being told they're the "best country on Earth", when that is not true in any sense of the words.  You guys need to start putting heads on pikes.
It makes me sick to my stomach when I realize some people are making money, earning power, building a prosperous life using violence, fear, terror. These people exist in almost every country. Like, these put a smile on their face. They earn billions because of it, can support their spoiled kids study in Harvard, buy high quality drugs, coke for whole family...
Wherever you are, please consider donating blood. Blood supply is critically low Nationwide and one donation can save up to 3 lives. If you're in Texas, especially, blood is being shipped to Uvalde for those receiving treatment
This man just became my personal hero.
Term limits. This shit will not end unless we get the power back to the people. Period.
And that’s how you use a platform. 👏
Sadly the people in power love the money the firearms business brings in more than how many people lose their lives over it. They want to make firearms are accessible as possible to make the most profit. It's pretty painfully obvious. Just tragic system.
He's right about us being numb to this every time this happens. Stuff like this shouldn't be the norm to us.
This is so fucked up. I'm on the other side of the world and I still don't understand how the fuck is this a thing. High powered guns for what use exactly?!
Was banned from r/conservative for evening mentioning stronger gun control yet I’m the snow flake lmao
The gun reform debate ended once we failed to act after 20 children were killed at sandy hook
[Highlight] Luka Doncic hits the game-winning three point shot at the buzzer

Mark Cuban is living the fucking dream
That's gotta be one of the best individual playoff performances ever. 43/17/13 & game winner in OT. On a sprained ankle. UNBELIEVABLE.
Mike Breen yelling “Bang” on a Luka game winner, with the summer sunlight coming through my window, I swear life was normal for a second there.
Ball game
“The two best wing defenders since MJ and Scottie” then Reggie Jackson ends up guarding Luka on the last posession.
#BAAAAANG BAAAAANG
Playoff P in shambles
LUKA
BAAAANG
Shaq down playing this, like they weren't down 21 and came back to win.
I don't understand this man sometimes.
BRO HOW THE FUCK IS HE THIS GOOD
"That's a bad shot" -PG
HOLY SHIT
 At this point Mark Cuban has to both put up a statue of Vlade Divac outside their arena, then give him a job for life.
Just asked my wife if it's too late to change the son's to Luka. 2 years old is young enough still, right?
doncic corleone
To the #1 on r/all we go

Luka is cold as ice man
You guys remember when he was a 19-year-old Euro League MVP and wasn't the consensus #1 overall pick? Good times
Luka’s a fucking god
This guy is only 21 years old. Ice cold.
HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.
Clutch ass white boy
That was a fucking wild game. That's one of those "man I wish I didn't root for either team so I could enjoy this" type of games. 

With that said....

**LUUUUUUUUUKKKAAAAA!!! LETS FUCKING GO I'M SO FUCKING HARD RIGHT NOW!!!!!**
Lol kings
BANG BAAANG
THIS WAS THE SHOT OF THE PLAYOFFS
Is this the mavs best moment since they beat us?
I swear to god "Playoff P" jinxed himself talking shit to Dame
I always hated Luka in the Euroleague because i am Fenerbahce fan and he beat us in the final game with his team Real Madrid, but i am feeling lucky because i started to see his greatness from the beginning even before the NBA. And i am glad to see people make disrespecting his Euroleague accomplishments and say he can’t do in the NBA are wrong. (English is not my main language but i hope you guys understand what I tried to say)
43/17/13, on nearly 60% shooting, with no KP, on a sprained ankle, down 21, game winner. Luka Dončić is 21, and it’s his first playoff series. He was made in a fucking lab.
[Highlight] Luka apologies to Montrezl postgame
THATS A BAD SHOT
 - Pandemic P
BRO MY POOR DOG IS FREAKED OUT AT MY REACTION TO THAT!  IM SORRY GOOD BOY!
To think the mavs might be up 3-1 if KP wasnt unjustly thrown out of game 1
#LUKA MAGIC
MAVS SHOULD BE UP 3-1
30 years from now: "Harrell wasn't a threat, but it became personal."
Paul George was hiding, didn't want to become the only guy in history to get posterized twice without even being dunked on.
oh my god Luka is literally god like he just tied this series by himself almost. Wow 40pt triple double AND THE GAME WINNING STEPBACK 3
"It was a bad shot"
oh my god
Fucking got em
marvin bagley
[deleted]
Would’ve been perfect if PG guarded it
Absolutely incredible shot but I truly don’t understand why the clippers switched Jackson there. 

On the few switches I saw Luka got whatever he wanted against Jackson. Understand they screened Leonard but it was clear this is a matchup the Mavs wanted
THAT'S MY GOAT
Jesus Christ this guy is Michael Jordan esque.
What's almost as impressive to me is that right after he gave a pretty good interview. He talked up the Clippers and his teammates. He gave props to everyone. I would have still been jumping up and down and going wild. But I guess that's the difference from a 21 year old who is the next big thing and has ice in his veins and a 31 year old overweight father of 5.
Dude had 43p/17re/13a and to top it off hit the buzzer beater in overtime to win the game and tie the series. 

That’s GOAT shit right there.
That little hesitation with 3 seconds to play takes huge balls
ESPN wants Zion to be the face of the NBA so badly. What they don't realize is this is it. Giannis and Luka are it.
That’s a bad man!
Kings fans watching Luka and the Mavs must feel like watching the girl you turned down in HS who later became a Victoria's Secret supermodel getting fucked by other dudes.
Early to say but man, this kid could be a legend of the game.
I cry every time luka does this because of what could've been
Cold blooded
This is the craziest basketball game I have ever seen
Luka joins the Double Bang Club!
This mf 21 and in his first playoff series hitting game winners and having 40 point triple doubles against a top defensive team.


Also, Paul George LOL
Bitch-ass white boy / 43-17-13
Montrezl Harrell / 2-1-1
COLD BLOODED!!!
WOWOWOWOWOOWOOSOAJFK
LUKA MAGIC
A star is born. What a performance.
LUKA FUCKING MAGIC
Mark Cuban is ferociously jerking off to a picture of Luka right now.
HES ON HIS WAY TO BE THE GOAT
I WAS HERE AND SAW THIS LIVE
LUKA DONCIC YOU LEGEND
The double bang is a rare and beautiful thing
2 touching Kobe tributes today:
-Luka going full Mamba
-Clippers going full Clippers
#EVERYBODY GET IN HERE
The guy airballed THREE straight step back 3s and of course hits the game winner off a step back. What a shot.
WOW
OMG THIS GUY IS NUTS
Luka top 5 player? I say yes
Why Shaq hating so much?
MAKE LUKA THE FACE OF THE NBA. ENOUGH OF THIS ZION STUFF
 PG woke up feeling dangerous today 😈  

9 points 🤧🤧  

21% from the field 😱🔥🔥  

14% from 3 point range 💥💥  

3 assists 🤤🤒🤒  

2 turnovers 👑👑  

1 steal 🔒🔒  

4 fouls 👀😠 

What is going on with him?
This is now officially the most-upvoted highlight in r/nba history
He looks like a future GOAT. This game convinced me.
Luka once said he was surprised that Kings didn't select him. Can't imagine how Kings feel now. Lmao.
GOAT level shit here
Luka the Shoota
Luka Magic
#ShaqShutupwith the calm down. Dude ball on one ankle without his best big man.
This is one of the all time legendary playoff performances in NBA history, and on a bad ankle.
How many fucking awards does this man's need lmao

Edit: nice
NO FUCKING WAY
Just absolutely fucking extraordinary.
Luka trending toward top 5 player of all time.
Paul George is probably over buzzer beaters by now.

Last year Dame ends OKC's season in his face

A few weeks ago Booker shoots a buzzer over him for the win

Today he stands there with his thumb in his ass and watches as Luka puts them away.

PG is just bad juju.
Kobe-esque shot in the clutch. Luka is goated.
Charles Barkley: “If you are gay or transgender, I love you. And if anybody gives you sh*t, you tell em Charles says ‘f**k you!’”

"I am not a role model!"

Well... You got me fooled Chuck.
Extremely common Charles Barkely W
Good guy Chuck.
Man, I fucking love this guy.
Headline had me scared to death because these usually never end well but Charles remains awesome
Chuck is a role model after all
I know Chuck says he ain't no role model, but hes gotta be one of my favorite people on the planet, love you Chuck!
Barkley is a national treasure.
People’s Champion
Epic quote from sir Charles
Chuck might go down as all around NBA GOAT. Fantastic player, broadcaster and has always responded very well with serious issues
Well, as a gay transgender person... I love you too, Charles
So I’m trans and seriously though, if anybody gives me shit, “Charles Barkley said ‘Fuck You’” is an amazing comeback lol
Great leadership Chuck. U made everybody in the world better today which adds to your legacy
Charles Barkley is for the people man. No reason to hate someone just because they're different.
Sent this to my mom's Midwest side of the family group chat, should be an interesting day.
Based Chuck
We also have to give a shout out to Dwayne Wade who openly and publicly embraced his transgender daughter
There’s never gonna be another like Chuck. The absolute realest of the real.  Greatest personality in the history of the league, wish I was old enough to have watched him play.
we as people need more moments like this
I love this man
Another W for the peoples GOAT
I’m sure he meant it I’m not questioning that but also does not seem drunk as shit?
Didnt know he was an ally for us like that

Iconic moment

I want this quote on a shirt

Edit: to whoever gave me silver, F you too
The dudes eyes next to Chuck 😂😂
What’s the context of this??
Who needs rings when you’re the people’s champion?
This man is a national treasure and we need to keep him around for a long time
I knew from the caption, and from other things Chuck has said that this was gonna be positive, but the tone he started with sounded so menacing for half a sec
TOO BASED
Of all the many causes I feel passionate about, transfolk are one of the top. I major in psychology. I have trans friends. This isn't a choice. This is biology. Denying people their biology just because they're trying hard to fit into a societal structure **THEY DIDN'T EVEN INVENT** is a human rights abuse.

Transfolk out there, I want to hug all of you. You are brave and you are ok.
What a bamf.
Fuck it let’s get Charles to run against Donald in 2024
As a trans person, who loves basketball I have nothin but love for Chuck!!   Glad to see more support in the community.
Common chuck W
Great leadership Chuck. U made everybody in the world better today which adds to your legacy.
Love you chuck!
This dude really is a national treasure. We must protect Chuck at all costs.
What a role model.

Seriously though, if you had told me back in his playing days that I'd end up admiring Charles more than Michael (for all kinds of reasons) , I'd have been shocked.
Chuck for the WIN! 😎👍
we love chuck ! i hope he enjoys retirement
This is awesome. Big props to Chuck ❤️
Absolute champion.
I really want people who face this discrimination to be like "OH YEAH WELL CHARLES BARKLEY SAID FUCK YOU!" and it go viral. I wanna see a bunch of intolerant asshols reduced to confusion.
Absolute W for Chuck. He has a long storied history of supporting the LGBT community.

Literally asked the 76ers unretire Billy Cunningham’s jersey to show solidarity with Magic in 92 (ik Magic’s not gay but he helped fight against the stigma against what was considered a “gay” disease). 

Also has been a very vocal and outspoken supporter of the LGBT community including as early as I think 2004 when it was a very unpopular thing to do. Chuck is legendary.
chuck will never be infallible, but thats what honestly makes him the perfect american role model, did tons of stupid shit as a youngster but as he matured, so did his ideals and honestly i think having a daughter was a huge turning point
Charles Barkley hates straight people - Fox News
Love hearing trans support in higher medias. My family basically ditched me cause I was dating a trans girl. Love ya chuck
Love Chuck
Hell yeah
Great leadership Charles. U made everybody in the house better today which adds to your legacy.
Charles Barkley / Ernie Johnson 2024
Good. I wish people treated LGBTQQIA+ people better.
As a queer dude who loves basketball, fuck yeah Charles. It’s nice to hear.
That’s a legend right there. Beautiful words
How can such a great player be an even better person?
The anti-Jordan.

Wish it was Charles who won those rings back in the 90s.

Dude seems like he genuinely loves life and the other people he shares this planet with.

People that hate gays and transgender folk, I hope they get help for their own incredibly high insecurity.
[deleted]
That's a way better take on it than Chappelle.
Hell yea Chuck! He never cared what ignorant people thought, and he thinks you shouldn't either!
Hell yeah, Chuck
Barkley is bringing the type of inclusivity that the rest of Alabama should aspire to have.
PUT THIS MAN ON THE $20 BILL
Charles, please live forever.
Tell em
Homophobia/transphobia is turrible!
As a queer person I'm so glad things like this are said in this community especially after considering how these issues are dealt with in other subs
What a real one. 

Love you too, Charles.
love chuck
a legend

he just legit seems to genuinely love people.
I LOVE THIS! I know some people who are gay or transgender. And it makes me so happy that Charles Barkley supports them.
Send this to KD, chuck added to his legacy
Creator bless this good man
Thanks Chuck.

I'm gonna go down to Provincetown next week to buy weed anyway, I bet they are selling the tshirts by then.
my goat fr
Face of the NBA. Fuck MJ and bron
We're all people. Let other people be if they're not doing anything to you. Leave other people alone and mind your own business.
Based
chuck is for the goddamn community

love this big fucker
Based
Allies like this are just incredible. Almost makes me tear up. Thanks Charles. You are the man.
I couldn’t possibly love this man more
Look at you, Chuck!!!
Being a role model, and shit.
Well done, sir!
Well done.
God bless you, Chuck.
And he said he wasn’t a remodel. I love this!
Chuck is a role model.
Chuck is just a good man plain and simple. For someone who was so controversial as a player, every story I hear about him now is wholesome.
I can't express enough how much it means for people like Chuck to speak up like this. 

90s basketball era tough guy, made a living with his physical play. Is known for not giving a fuck and speaking up his mind. A lot of times people give Celebrities shit for being fake and only supporting the cause for the attention with well crafted PR announcements.

Chuck just said how he felt at the moment at a random DJing event or wherever the fuck this is. 

This will open up a lot of minds. My dad who still struggles with sharing his acceptance, often uses things like this as fuel to continue his change for the better and it's amazing to see. Players like Charles were his idols back in the day and seeing them so open signals him that it's okay for him to be open as well and help out his friends to be better as well.
Love to see figures in sports support trans and queer lives unabashedly like Chuck is doing here. Dude’s awesome.
Charles is a national treasure.

Protect this man at all costs.
a man of the people
The copium is strong in some folks here. The normal crowd is cool with this because not giving a shit about someone else's personal life ris fucking normal. Gay rights and trans rights are human rights, cope and seethe about it.
I’m a straight white guy and that made me strangely emotional, love Chuck
And with that, red state America just disowns Charles
Say it again, for the haters in the back, Charles.
I fucking love it.

What was the context for this? Some kind of after hours party? Either way, Chuck is the master of reasonable takes
Bruh why is NBA publicity always sooo much better than any other sport.

MLB players are insufferable for some reason and the NFL is just a fuckin mess always
Love you back Chuck.
W
Goat
i love you too Chuck!
Fuck yeah, man, love to see it
Thats my goat
THATS MY FUCKING HERO, CHARLES BARKLEY.
Love this , go chuck.
Extremely based
I guaranteeeeeeeeee that I’ll kick a homophones ass
Charles Barkley vs Dave Chappell on Celebrity Deathmatch.
I want the man on the left’s reactions to more things. His face is amazing

Also much love to Chuck
His legend grows with his waistline. Chuck is the man.
Chuck is such an awesome guy, for real.
[Charania] Nets star Kyrie Irving has entered COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

[Wojnarowski: Irving needs five consecutive days of negative tests to join the team at practice. Now, he’s the ninth Brooklyn player to enter into protocols.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1472263481831444481)

[Both @MattBrooksNBA and I told Kyrie had a positive test](https://twitter.com/NetsDaily/status/1472266127707451394)

[Irving tested positive, not just undergoing routine testing ahead of return.](https://twitter.com/Alec_Sturm/status/1472266597817585673?s=20)
this has been the best 24 hours for basketball i have ever seen.
Can someone please reverse the gif he posted so now it’s him untying his shoes?
A joke setup where the punchline lands 12 hours later.
Kyrie is legit  [Abe Simpson Meme](https://tenor.com/G7PM.gif)
19 hours, for those wondering
Considering the context, this is one of the funniest NBA-related tweets of all time
Tough loss for Brooklyn. I really enjoyed Kyrie’s presence this season.
bro just finished lacing up his shoes lmaooo
All time /r/nba moment calling it now
LMAO. NETS WANTED A CIRCUS AND THEY GOT ONE
4k upvotes in 20 minutes lmao
grand opening grand closing
Snip snap, Snip snap!
How do you get fired on your day off vibes
Nets: Do you have COVID?

Kyrie: I am COVID.
Well, that was fast
*Curb theme plays*
This is the greatest punchline I’ve literally ever seen
this is the funniest shit i’ve seen on this sub in a while LMAOOOOOO we are living in a meme confirmed
This has to be one of the funniest but most predicted event in the NBA this year 🤣
Dude lol
The Onion doesn’t even need to exist anymore.
This will be great for all the research he’s conducting
Whoever writes for the NBA deserves a Pulitzer for this season
Kyrie is a real team player, joining the rest of the nets in health and safety protocols
Kyrie’s mind is free but his body is trapped
BLOCKED BY OMICRON
Boy the league is insane rn. Finals will be 1 v 1 squid game between the last two players not in covid protocol 😂.
Sometimes reality is the best storyboarder in the world
This is gonna be the most upvoted post in rnba history
Mark this thread. This will go down in r/nba history and talked about for generations to come.
My first audible laugh of the day.
Okay I cant even lurk for this shit this is hilarious lmao
Lmfao holy shit this is just an irl SNL skit at this point
I don’t even watch the NBA, but I wanted to be a part of this because everyone looks like they are having so much fun.
No way. Who ever could have predicted this?
Kyrie just out here playing 5G checkers.
WR SPEED RUN ANY%
Look at all the awards in less than an hour LMAO! Im calling it its gonna be r/nba 's most upvoted post of all time
So surprised that a plan to deal with a COVID crisis by bringing back a player unvaccinated against COVID didn’t work out.
posting in legendary thread
The writing has really jumped the shark this season. They need to at least let the plot points breathe a little between each one. Lol
I was here.
Truly the any% champion
hello goodbye
💀 not even a full 24 hours
Kyrie: I'm ready to play.

Nets: We need you to play.

Omicron: Not so fast, playa.
Mf came back with a vengeance
#LMFAOOOOO
#LMFAOOO EVERYONE GET IN HERE
Ever called your ex up for a booty call and get the clap from her?

This is that.
Ok, this is the first time that a player catching Covid made me laugh a bit
YOU CANT MAKE THIS SHIT UP LMAOOOOO
Well well well if it isn’t the consequences of my own actions
And boom goes the dynamite! This headline is /r/NBA fan fiction come to life. Holy shit!
I don't believe in any kind of god, but this is almost enough proof that there's something out there with a wicked sense of humor.
hahahahahahah Welcome back Kyrie
I'm just commenting here so I can be part of the biggest r/NBA post of all time. See y'all in the history books.
Everyone is gonna be making fun of Kyrie, and rightfully so, but man, NYC is in real bad shape right now. It feels like everyone here has Covid or has been exposed to it in the past week or two, pretty grim
Just read a r/conspiracy thread about how this guy should get a standing ovation that lasts the entire game. Hahahaha what a bunch a dweebs.
Nets FO: folding

Basketball Gods: “I got this shit”
You mean the incense he was burning and all those rituals didn't keep him immunized?
/r/LeopardsAteMyFace
This is without a doubt the most satisfying post ever made on this sub, maybe the entirety of Reddit. Bwahahah
The NBA is a dramedy
Omg everyone get in here!
Kyrie thinks he has all the answers. Just call him Allen Ivermectin.
TOP POST OF ALL TIME HERE WE COME EVERYONE COME BE PART OF HISTORY
I gave him 3 weeks to get it. Less than 3 days is impressive.
every time i refresh this post it has new awards

funniest shit you can possibly imagine you love to see it
Covid had to remind Kyrie who was in charge
This is one of the funniest things that has happened in my lifetime. I'm getting weird looks in the gym while giggling to myself.
this is an espn instant classic
Ive never laughed so hard at a shams tweet in my life
Cold opening where Kyrie rants about not wanting to get the vaccine. Then gets convinced to play road games. Someone asks: “what about COVID??”  Kyrie: “Come on man, I’m not going to get COVID.”

*It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia music plays*

Title card: Kyrie gets COVID.
OHHHH Covid tagged him! He's hurt....IT IS ALL OVER. JUST. LIKE. THAT.
Where were you when Kyrie Irving, famous antivaxxer, was given permission to play during the 2021 season despite being ruled out for the season for refusing the vaccine only to enter COVID health & safety protocols just 12 hours later?
Can’t make this up 😂😂
The Nets are the most hilarious franchise in the league
Got the vaccine the hard way.
I cackled. All-star comedic timing
Kyrie trying to speed run his return already smh /s
I normally don't upvote posts 

I'm helping this hoping it'll reach #1 all time. 

Sits out whole season not wanting to get vaccinated. Gets tested to return to play. Has COVID

Hillarious
I'm just here to be part of the history of the funniest r/NBA post of all time.
First post I ever considered buying an award for
When people ask what drama or comedy series I’m currently watching, I’m just going to say NBA. This is fucking crazy lmao
This is why this sub exist lol!
BING BONG
I never laughed this hard at a covid news before
I have NEVER seen more awards given for a post on Reddit before lmfaoooooooo
This is 100% the funniest thing that could have happened
If only there was something free and effective to prevent this
You literally cannot write the NBA season better than this lmaooo
I guess this is where we're dumping our free awards today
Didn't even make it to his first game
Can't make this shit up lmao
I want to make a funny joke. Also I’m out of shape and fat and don’t want to die due to bad karma when I get covid. 

Good luck Kyrie. God bless
The most prefect, predictable next chapter in this saga
As if Brooklyn didn’t already look like straight clowns
Where are all of the nets fans defending kyrie yesterday?
We live in a /r/nba simulation

Pierce sure has let himself come across as a real fucking clown this year. 

It’s all a gimmick. Not a fan.  From his “I was better than wade” to his “bucks are done” to his “i confess I shit my pants”, it’s him playing the role of the village idiot to draw attention to the show.  Taking the “no publicity is bad publicity” route and it’s annoying.

Kobe was always supposed to be one of those guys that had a hand in the NBA till he’s 80 like Bill Russel. This is so upsetting. RIP
Another player and parent on the plane with Kobe and Gianna. God rest their souls and let’s all show an outpouring of support for those families who lost loved ones today. 

[Don’t forget about Kobe & Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation](http://kvbff.org/). Today would be a great day to show them our love and graciousness.
Kobe is sooo legendary that it feels like he was never supposed to die let alone go this early....RIP Mamba
So it's official, fuck.

Celebrity deaths are always random but this one hits different man, just wtf.
I cannot believe this is actually real. 41 is young
May we all forever shout his name as we throw away a crumpled up piece of paper until the end of time.
I can’t believe someone is going to have to give a posthumous acceptance speech in honor of Kobe at the Hall of fame this fall
what the fuck. this is one of the most insane, out of left field headlines i’ve ever seen. RIP to an absolute legend
I feel physically sick. Man was just going to enjoy an incredible retirement after working his ass off his whole life being one of the greatest athletes of all time and then this happens.
Watching Kobe become the kind of elder statesman who gave props to the upcoming generation — I was legit looking forward to that side of him.

DAMN.

*EDIT*: Two other things I do want to note:

1. I was really looking forward to see what the dude was gonna cook up business-wise. He had money, he had ambition, and he had smarts. I mean, he won an Oscar!

2. Dude was definitely Top 5 most influential NBA players. You can argue all day about his position in the pantheon of NBA greatness, but his influence is undeniable.
He was just here...
I'm lost for words, the day after LeBron passes him in points

E: Fuck bro. RIP. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376
My favorite Kobe memory is actually off-the-court:

During the 2011 lockout, he told players that if they hadn't saved money to weather the lockout, he would lend them money so they wouldn't simply cave to the owners. This helped the players' side out. [Proof from 2011](https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-sep-18-la-sp-pugmire-qa-20110919-story.html)
I don't even know how to react to this, it seems crazy that Kobe is just...gone?
This came so out of no where, it's so sad. My thoughts are with his wife and four daughters man. Crazy
I can’t even. This doesn’t seem real. RIP Legend
Neymar after scoring:
https://twitter.com/Dezildezzz/status/1221542084953493504
Crazy stuff. As a spurs fan, his games against us growing up were always legendary. RIP Kobe
Holy crap. What a loss. 

Kobe Bryant has done countless amounts of good to the world, probably got a lot of us here out of rough times.

Let's not forgot those who were also lost in the crash and their families. They will forever live with "my brother/sister/father/mother/etc died in the crash that killed Kobe." I wish them all well.
The worst part about this for me is just the future Kobe should have had being erased. Never got to be inducted into the HoF. Never got to see the Lakers win another championship. I was just so looking forward to the next 35+ years of Kobe basketball analysis. He had so much to offer to this game still, and to this world. I can't believe he's gone.
What the fuck, I have no words.  All those articles written about his career in the past few weeks with lebron passing him, and it just ends like that.  A tragedy in all senses.
I hated Kobe growing up but I feel like crying.
"I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it."

Rest in peace, Mamba
Titan of the game died today. Way too fucking young.
I'm sick to my stomach. His poor wife and daughters
Im in shock right now... he had multiple daughters. This is so unfair
What the fuck. I can't believe it. Kobe was like Jeter as Celtics fan in that you hated how dominant he was as a player but had the ultimate respect for him for being a legend of the game.

Can't even imagine how his family feels.

RIP to one of the greatest to ever play.
Let kobes death be the reason we wake up tomorrow and take it to the next level!

Make the mamba proud and let’s start bein the best version of ourselves
Raptors just ran out the 24 second shot cold on the first posession. Now the Spurs are doing the exact same on the second possesion.
May 23, 2010. The Suns had just won game 3 of the WCF against LA, 118-109. Kobe had 36, but went 2-8 from beyond the arc, missing his only two attempts in the 4th when the game was close. Game ended at 11 pm, and I had a few things to finish up before heading home. The way the arena was set up, the fastest route to the parking garage was to walk through the main bowl after leaving the office. As I make my way out at 11:30 pm, the lights in the arena dim, I hear a ball bouncing on the main court. I look to see who it was, and found Kobe out there shooting 3s. By himself. Top of the key, shoot, make it, get the ball. Back to the top of the key, shoot, miss, get the rebound. No coaches, no trainers, no teammates. Just the best player on earth, practicing his 3 point shot, alone. I sat down about 20 rows up, in an otherwise empty 18,000 seat arena, and watched one of the best five humans to ever play the sport practice in solitude for 25 minutes. After he had put up probably 75 or 80 threes from all around the arc, he grabbed the ball and went to the locker rooms. 

That night taught me so much about what it meant to be THE. BEST. About putting in work that no one sees. About perseverance. About never being happy with how good you are and always wanting to improve, even if you’re already the best. Kobe made a lifelong fan in those 25 minutes. RIP to one of the all time greats.
Some people are like "oh its a celebrity you don't even know the person" but people underestimate how these people touch lives. I was a kid with cancer during the '01 playoff run. I had a make a wish foundation wish to let you know how bad I was. I wanted to meet Shaq and Kobe. It's late May early June so yeah that's not happening so I settle for a PS2 a bunch of tech stuff and a big screen tv (I couldn't travel because my immune system was shot and I was afraid to ask for too big of a TV to tell you how innocent I was).   


Well....two weeks later I get a call. Who but Bean, calling me telling me he heard I wanted to meet him and how he was out there playing for kids like me and how he appreciated having me as a fan and to hang in there and I can overcome anything ect.   


It was only a 4-5 minute call but it lifted my spirits. I never told any of my friends about it, only my parents eve knew about it. I'm not saying it saved my life, but it gave me hope....  


I had a \~20% chance for survival.   


That was 20 years ago.  


That man influenced the way I look at and attack life. 

 I woke up this evening to the news of his passing and I've been crying on and off the entire time here at work trying to reason with myself "hey this is just a basketball player why the fuck are you crying man get over it" But I felt like a member of my own family passed. These people touch us in ways words can't always express.   


You will be missed dearly Kobe and I hurt for all those hurting in you, and the other passengers passing.

I would rather watch the Lakers lose 100 finals back to back against the Boston Celtics than for this to happen.

RIP Kobe 

edit: i'm just using this an expression to convey how painful this is. i apologize if it seems like i am trying to compare a human life to a game. i am not.
I feel like the public was just starting to see a side of him, even better than his basketball self, as a parent, as a figure of success and ambition. This is tough to swallow.
this one is weirdly hitting me different. obviously because of the timing, but Kobe had this aura that was like he was never supposed to die. like he would outsmart and outwork death. this is just nuts

Not like this
What really hit me hard is when I wondered to myself what his final words to GiGi were.
NBA should add #24 jersey patch to all team's jerseys the rest of the season
Coach Altobelli did a lot for the OC community. A lot of loss in that crash for the Southern California community and beyond
Anyone else just texting and refreshing reddit for the last 6 hrs?
Jay Williams being real as fuck right now on ESPN 2. Someone who came close to losing his life.
Two Kobe moments that I will cherish forever:

- That sheer joy he had when he beat the Magic in the Finals for his first championship without Shaq.  I remember him jumping up and down, throwing out his fist in celebration.

- The gutsy, Kobe-esque 60 point final performance that reminded us why we love basketball in the first place.

What a fucking legend.  I don't think I was ever a Kobe fan, but it's hard to be a basketball fan and have no love for him to some extent.  I just watched his last game a month ago or so.

Gone, but never forgotten.

Gigi passed away in the crash man fuck this sick world
The next Inside the NBA show is gonna be a tough one...
Here he is talking about tragedies in an article back in 2004...

> Kobe is speaking out. It’s late fall of 2001, a few weeks after 9/11. He has just finished a rigorous practice. He sits just off the court, uncharacteristically still, gazing past the rookies shooting free throws. He’s thought a lot about that September morning, a lot about the nature of disaster in general. “Things change in the blink of an eye,” he says. “It’s really scary. That’s the toughest part of life to me: People go to work and don’t come back. One minute they’re living; the next minute they’re not. And it doesn’t matter who you are. There’s nothing you can do about it. Bill Cosby’s son was killed. Something that still upsets me in the death of Michael Jordan’s father.”

http://www.thestacksreader.com/what-kobe-bryant-was-capable-of/
This is the biggest sports celebrity death of all time. RIP to the legend Kobe
TMZ has just confirmed that Gianna (one of his daughters) was also on board. Man, rip to a legend...
Seeing that his daughter also perished really makes my heart hurt for his wife. I have no idea how I could handle losing my spouse let alone a child at the same time.

Coincidentally, my two year old son just came into the living room and asked me for a family hug. I had to call my wife in for it. It was one of the best hugs I’ve ever had.
Sick to my stomach
Damn man Tyson chandler straight up crying on the bench
I don't usually get hit hard by celebrity/athlete deaths. This one hurts. Kobe Bryant is the reason why I started watching basketball. He's the reason why the Lakers are my favorite team. I had tears during his 60 point final game. He was my literal idol. The last time something made me this sad was Chester Bennington's death back in 2017. This such a tragic heartbreaking day. RIP Kobe Bryant. Mamba out
It just adds to the devastation that we won't be able to hear/watch Kobe's Hall of Fame speech, AND, Inside the NBA guest hosting.

Kobe had always been the most charismatic speaker. I personally try to watch all his interview. His words just pumped you up in everything that you do. Its just so sad we won't be able to know what he'll say at his HoF speech.  
  
And of course, pretty sure Kobe will be joining the guys at Inside the NBA, and man, that will bring monumental entertainment.   
   
We were robbed of this suppose to be great experience.   
  
RIP Kobe.

Seeing kobes name with a date range under is unfucking bearable man
Today was the only day I can remember where almost everyone on this sub was in agreement. I honestly cannot recall a time that almost every topic posted was filled with comments of users agreeing with one another. No fighting about teams, no arguing about players, no debates about the better team. And this is r/NBA. I've seen people get into serious arguments over Lebron's hairline. 

My point is that this is really a testament to how culturally significant today has been. None of these games have mattered. Hell, the coaches and players even said as much. None of the stats mattered. The all star starters were just announced but that doesn't matter. These all took a back seat so that we could all mourn the loss of an icon, together. And I'm glad that we are able to do that. By no means am I saying this was a good day but in my attempt to look for a silver lining, I noticed the overwhelming sense of comradery that hasn't been evident before. 

This is a day that will be etched in all of our minds forever. And a huge part of that is due to being able to share it with others who are older, younger, fans of opposing teams, haters, anything. Today was a terrible day but let's remember the following: He really was amazing and we will be celebrating his achievements for a long time to come.
This is a serious discussion of a tragic event. All trolling of any kind will be met with immediate bans, no questions asked.
[deleted]
His daughter being involved makes it harder to process. An nba legend didn’t die, half of a family died. No amount of rewatching highlights and celebrating his success will make it feel okay. Absolutely heartbreaking
Honestly hearing that his daughter also passed away is hurting me more than anything
Tiger Woods just finished his round and his Caddy told him the news. Tiger said “excuse me” and walked away from his caddy. Tough scene
Has anyone else been feeling like shit and moody all day? I can't wrap my head around this. I'm just feeling miserable right now. And then the other breaking news that his daughter was with him. This is too much. Rest in peace to all involved. It just isn't clicking with me. Tomorrow, I'm gonna wake up, and within a second I'll remember what happened.
RIP Gianna..she was only 13...
ABC said, live on television during the Pro Bowl, that all of his daughters died on board as well.

If they got this wrong then every single one of them should be fired. Holy fuck.
[deleted]
Grossly irresponsible for ABC to report that, errors like that just can't happen
https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/

One daughter...
I’m hurting for the family, I can’t imagine how Vanessa is doing
Stephan A in tears doing the coverage.  This news is devastating
I think his daughter and the other young player on board are the most heartbreaking. Losing a legend is going to hurt fans around the world, but it is proof Kobe lived a full life. His daughter and her teammate never got that chance to be great and we will never know where it could of taken them.

A sad day all round.
Mods please instaban the trolls
I just reminded myself of a story I read the other day. 

Dwight Howard had hinted he wanted to be a part of the Dunk Contest. Story went on about how he's healed feelings with Lakers fans, and he was hoping they could help him get one more thing.

He wanted to smooth things over with Kobe, and wanted him to help in the [contest.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/01/dwight-howard-wants-kobe-bryants-help-in-the-dunk-contest) Read that maybe 2 days ago. 

>“I’m trying to get Kobe. So if I can get all the Laker fans to lobby to get Kobe to help me in the dunk contest, that’d be really good. That’d be awesome.”
The Grammy's are at Staples Center tonight, and they're keeping his retired jerseys illuminated all night

EDIT: Lizzo just started her performance with "tonight is for Kobe"
Dude like every 30 minutes or so it just hits me that Kobe fucking Bryant is dead and I just start crying again. I haven't felt this way over a celebrity death since Chester Bennington died.

It's my 24th birthday today too. Pretty shitty birthday gift
Why do i come back to this thread... I dont know, you will forever be in my heart
It’s weird to me how someone you never met face to face could impact you so much. I come back to this post often as it still just doesn’t feel real. I’m not some old head that watched his every game, I didn’t grow up in a house of Lakers fans, but I grew up in a basketball house, one that watched and played it almost religiously. That’s when I fell in love with Kobe Bryant. I remember times when I was about 9 or 10, playing with the neighborhood kids on our little dead end street, trying to emulate everything he did. Trying to *be* him. The years passed, I stayed with him, through thick and thin, I always watched him. I was never a Lakers fan, but I was a Kobe fan. And watching that final game, seeing the magic again, to go out on top, was just incredible. It motivated me, that no matter what is happening in my life I can get through it. I can succeed and come out on top. I can do anything. I know this will get lost in the shuffle, an old post that people don’t frequent too much. But I had to clear my head. I never got the chance to meet you, Kobe. But I feel a part of you in me always.

Mamba forever
As a journalist myself (not in sports, but still), it's sickening how some  outlets  raced to be among the first to break  news and in the process reported all of Kobe's daughters being dead without confirmation.  Whoever was involved at getting that  on air for ABC should be fired and blacklisted from the industry.
I just need to hear his daughters are okay
I’m not a big Kobe fan. But the dude got me into basketball in the first place. First my grandma this morning, now Kobe. What the fuck 2020, I want to go back.
TMZ just reported Kobe's daughter died in the crash as well
I just realized, he didn’t live to see his election to the Hall of Fame.
I can’t imagine the pain Vanessa Bryant is feeling right now. Her husband and daughter. I just cannot believe this.
A lot of people are writing what Kobe meant to them, I feel like sharing too. What first introduced me to basketball was Kobe. As a Canadian immigrant I was learning about the sports in Canada. At 10-11 years old, Kobe was the talk of town, everyone in class would yell Kobe when shooting garbage into a trash can for years...I couldn't even name a hockey player, all I knew was Kobe until I learned of Sydney Crosby.

I still remember the Lakers-Celtics battles in the 09-12 (?) years, Kobe and Pierce battling it out. While I'm not a huge basktball, I still follow the NBA now and then, Curry and the Warriors, Lebron...but Kobe introduced so many people to the game like me.
I have zero clue how Vanessa and the 17 year old will be able to function after losing a father/husband and daughter/sister. And the toddler and baby don't get to grow up knowing their big sister or father. Tragic awful day
As much as we love Kobe, RIP to his beautiful and talented daughter, the other parent and daughter, and the pilot. They should not be forgotten.

Yo this is fucking surreal. 

I’m on holiday in Honolulu and was walking down Waikiki and I see something about Kobe and his daughter on the news on TV. Here’s me thinking Mamba is running a clinic in the area but when I get closer it’s like.. wow.. fuck..

Was legit talking to a dude today in a Kobe jersey giving him shit about the lakers and two hours later I see this.

Goddamn. RIP. 

Thank you for being one of the most influential athletes during my childhood.

As much as people like to meme the whole Kobe showing up at 3am the day before- it really showed me what you needed to be willing to do to have a CHANCE at being successful in this life.

Goddamn Kobe man, and his daughter too- what the fuck.
[Tyson Chandler, Austin Rivers, PJ Tucker emotional](https://i.redd.it/2gxamfs867d41.jpg)
[Postgame interview with Pop.](https://youtu.be/3FRM0rTcgOg)
As a  girls basketball coach, man, this hits on another level knowing his daughter is gone with her whole life ahead of her. Going to have to remember to give some extra positivity and love to my team tomorrow.
Don't know where to say this but I thought I'd leave it here. Obviously Kobe and Gigi's deaths are just unimaginably sad.. To think that this actually happened is surreal. Kobe's legacy will live on until the end of time and he will never be forgotten. Vanessa will undoubtedly have to carry this weight for the rest of her life, and I truly hope that she will be able to, for her sake as well as the sake of their other children.

Prayers go out to the Altobelli family. John and his wife were also on that helicopter with their daughter, and as we know they all tragically lost their lives. They have two other children, a son and another daughter who have now lost their parents and a sister... I can't imagine the emotional burden that they will have to carry from now on.

Thoughts and prayers go out to the pilot's family. The only thing I can hope is that the deaths were quick and painless. As for the other victims, we are unsure of who they are for now, let's just all take a moment and give a thought for everyone involved.

May they all rest in Peace. 💔
I can't sleep. I have class in the morning, but I'm just laying here not falling asleep. I'm only 32 years old. Kobe was a part of a good chunk of my life. 3 games a week at almost 3 hours each. I have close friends that I don't see as often as I saw Kobe for 20 years.
Anyone else can't fall asleep? Heart is heavy tonight.
Absolutely tragic. Eerie after seeing him last night at the game. So horrible.
Man, Jay Williams giving a tearful tribute to Kobe on ESPN now, I feel bad that people have to be put up in front of the camera in times like this but he's doing a great job
Tuesday night. Clips. Lakers. Not one dry eye at Staples. 

RIP to the Black Mamba.
Raptors and Spurs each started the game with back to back 24 second shot clock violations
RIP to the other parent and other child who died on the crash as well.
RIP Kobe Bryant, Gianna Bryant, the other passengers and the pilot. He was my image of determination, and fearlessness. Today, I am going to cry. Tomorrow I am going to work harder than ever. For every bucket, thank you Kobe for your mamba mentality.
I'm so sad for Kobe, but even more sad for his daughter. She was 13 and had her whole life ahead of her. I can't imagine the despair he felt, helpless to protect his daughter in those final moments.
I just can't believe it.  What the fuck.

I think after seeing guys like Bill Russell, Magic, Bird, etc. all be these elder statesmen of the league I just assumed we had decades of elder statesman Kobe.  But he's just...gone.  Fuck.
Today we don't talk stats, count rings, or discuss rankings. 

Today we remember a legend and a one of the most massively influential presences in NBA history on an off the floor. A true ambassador and icon that grew larger than the game he worked tirelessly to perfect. 

RIP Mamba, Gigi, and the other 3 lives that were lost in this tragedy. May your families find solace in remembering how great the lives you lived were, even if they were unfairly cut short. 

Fucking sad day all around.
Lost a friend in a freak Uber accident last week, funeral was yesterday, now this.  2020 fucking blows
https://streamable.com/0mzn2
Just a Dad taking his daughter to her basketball game. Tragic.
Bruh yall see Stephen A on espn. He looked like he had cried all day, just looked in the camera with this dead 1000 yard look, and they said he would be on all day...


WTF just let the man go home and grieve.
Has anyone confirmed any of his family as being alive somewhere right now?
Wikipedia now says Kobe Bryant *was* ...that breaks my heart.
I hope LeBron walks out in Kobes for our next game.
I just told a buddy of mine; this might be the first celebrity/athlete that has passed in my lifetime that I actually have an attachment to and effected me a little bit... I’m 30.
Magic called him the greatest laker of all time....classy.  RIP
I did not think I would be alive to see wall to wall news coverage of Kobe Bryant's death. I was imagining seeing him on those documentaries where old timers talk about what the game was like back then and playfully being asked  if they could beat the current superstar one on one. 

Most of us will probably live long enough to pay our respects to Magic and Bird and so on. That's just life. But Kobe? I would not have taken that bet.
One of the things that popped into my head.  Kobe never got to give his HOF speech.   He never got that satisfaction.   Obviously a minor thing comparatively but one that has stuck with me.
This is just too sad. Kobe was 41 but his daughter was only 13. She barely had a chance to live life. Until just recently, Kobe rarely made public appearances at Lakers games. But he went to a Laker home game against the Hawks just because his daughter wanted to see Trae Young. That showed just how much he cared for her. He was very gracious when LeBron passed him to become 3rd on the NBA’s All-Time Scoring List just a couple of days ago. Kobe was always surprising me with his athleticism, his fearlessness, and his unshakable drive to win. He even managed to surprise me after he retired by wining an Oscar. RIP to Kobe & Gianna. They both will be greatly missed.
I'm 33. Nobody's death has had this type of impact on me. It's got me thinking about the hours in the driveway with my dad rebounding. Planning my days around gym class in highschool. Slam magazine. MPLS throwback jerseys. 

The path he was on with coaching and mentoring his daughter was the start of something special. Absolutely tragic.
Giannis deleted his twitter. :/ He was close with Kobe.
ATC convo of the crash:

https://youtu.be/B0pQfgi9ZqU
I want to be teleported to the timeline where Kobe gets to give his HoF speech and watch Gigi, or any of his daughters, play in the WNBA.
My heart is broken for his wife and daughters. His youngest will never know him and that is sadder than words can express. I'll always remember Kobe's last game. Definitely one of the more magical moments in the history of the league. He'll never be forgotten.

It might sound cheesy, but his drive and passion for not just basketball but life in general is such a huge motivation to me. Basketball aside, the dude spoke fluent Spanish and Italian, and he won an Oscar. The dude had all the money in the world and could've just been content to live a quiet retirement, but he was far from done. He still had ambition to achieve more. And as someone who really needs to be more ambitious, I try to learn from that. 

He had only been out of the game for a few years and the possibilities were limitless with regards to what he was going to achieve with the rest of his life. It is an absolute tragedy we won't get to see what he would have done, but we have so many memories, and he can continue to motivate so many of us and instill ambition in us even when he isn't here.

And I think that's the biggest thing to take from his life. The ambition to achieve. The drive to improve oneself. In all aspects of life. When the tears dry, I urge people to try to incorporate these things into their own lives. It's easier said than done, but these are really universal concepts that are applicable to each and everyone across the board. Always try to move up. Constantly struggle to improve. I've been doing my best to do so in my own life, but have stagnated a bit as of late. Kobe has encouraged me to hop back on the wagon.

Thanks, Mamba. You'll never be forgotten and your legacy will be carried on not only in your beautiful family, but in the inspiration you've given millions of people throughout your career and life.
I can’t stop crying. I never cry. This hurts so fucking much man. A healthy, indestructible man like Kobe dying so young is a reminder of how fragile life is. And how the negativity isn’t worth it.  I’m changing to be a more positive person and changing my life for the better. Some of this shit just isn’t worth it!
So the last daughter of the Altobelli family is left without a family? That’s gut-wrenching. Can’t even imagine the pain.
Grammy Awards, in the Staples Center. 

Boyz II Men & Alicia Keys just sang, "It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday" a cappella. As they finished the camera panned to Kobe's jerseys side-by-side with lights on them. Don't think there was a dry eye in the place. I wasn't ready for that.
This will sound incrediblly fucked up but i hope they all died quickly.

Because if the coroner says they found smoke in their lungs that means they survived the crash and died from smoke inhalation/burned to death which is so fucked.
Wow.

[Sports Analytics 24/7] Trae Young is the first player to have a 45-point double-double with under 25 field goal attempts against the Washington Wizards, since Kobe Bryant on December 17, 2006.

I never saw the Oscar Animated Short until today, I was in tears the entire time. Here: https://believeentertainmentgroup.com/portfolio-item/dear-basketball/?fbclid=IwAR2N33OAcOAHwj3vTHU5J3NBB0pG3P8rVtSQ55V3RSNdQjqUpOEItnpMGBk
Man, this is crazy. This is too crazy. MJ is alive, TheLogo is alive, Bird is alive, Magic is alive, Kareem is alive, Bill Russell is alive and somehow KOBE is gone? No man, just no!
I know not many will see this but I just want to share. My first memories of basketball were eating pizza with my parents and watching our blazers play Kobe Bryant and the lakers when I was 5 or 6. My friend who was way into basketball and I would play Kobe vs Rasheed or Kobe vs Damon Stoudamire and take turns with who would be Kobe. When I got back into watching basketball in my teens I learned more about Kobe’s work ethic and he was an inspiration for me, an example of grit and passion and hard work. A ton of people say they don’t usually care about celebrity deaths and I think we all don’t care until we do. We all have public figures who have influenced us in our lives and their passing can feel like the passing of a family member or mentor even if we never had the good fortune to meet them in real life. And I know Kobe was like that for a lot of us, so spend tonight and the next few days talking about Kobe and his impact on this sport and our lives and celebrate the Mamba. RIP to one of the true GOATs.
This is legitimately the saddest news I think I've ever heard in my entire life. I can't even explain or rationalize why this means so much to me.

I'm 28 and I've legitimately cried more today than any day since I was a teenager. I never would've said "Kobe is my hero" or anything like that. but my entire upbringing was about sports, and I dunt know if there was a more "larger than life" figure for me than Kobe. He was literally amazing at everything. I have so many defining memories of him that are so nostalgic and incredible.

Just yesterday I was watching him celebrate with LeBron. It's been a legitimate joy to watch him transition into retirement and put the same effort he put into becoming one of the greatest players in NBA history to try to be the greatest dad. And that's what makes this so much more tragic, that Gigi is gone too.

I'm just so devastated. I was never a laker fan, never a "Kobe Stan", just someone who feels emotionally devastated right now because of all the amazing memories, all the wisdom we've received that is gone. And even worse is to realize all the things that Kobe and Gigi had ahead of them, that everybody lost
Jalen Rose: "I'll happily be a stepping stone in his history" 

I love Jalen man, hes always a real one
Man this still doesn't feel real. Just thinking back on all the time I spent arguing "who was better: Kobe or Bron?" back in the day...wow. Shits wild man. 

It's tough seeing your hero, who you saw as larger than life/not a normal human, dying. That's like...the most human shit ever. It really puts shit into perspective in a way that's different than when you lose a direct family member/loved one. It's really a strange feeling, to be so torn up over someone you never actually met. I don't know the "proper" way to mourn in this situation, as if there is one to begin with.

Just gonna get my mind right tonight and then really work towards that mamba mentality in my real life. It's time to focus up on my passions, no other way around it.
I was shy and overweight in high school. I moved away from LA when I was 9. Watching the Lakers made me feel close to home. Wearing Kobe sneakers/gear to school was the few things gave me confidence. I'm 22 now.  And KB's work ethic motivated me to get in shape and lose 70lbs, and be uplifting to those who are down whenever possible. I'm still sick to my stomach at his loss, Gianna's loss, and my heart hurts for the Bryant family. Thank you Kobe. Mamba mentality forever.

Kobe means so much for us, europeans fans. I mean we were waking up at 4am just to watch games, most people can not imagine the dedication and passion needed. We are devastated. Prayers to the families.

I am a hobbit pilot, by no mean a pro or investigator. Few words that I can say if it can helps :

* S76 is really a luxury and secure helicopter issues related to cooling, maintenance, improper testing,  doesn't apply here.
* The helicopter departed from an airport, it implies that it has been properly checked and fullfiled (no corrupted oil)
* There's very few chances that the copter was on fire before crashing. It's very rare to be honest and it's mostly due to the transmission to the main rotor. Another point is when your copter is on fire you are not burning in one second. More help messages would have been sent.
* It's a twin turboshaft engines, on this kind of devices it's almost impossible that both of the engine failed at same time...

From my little experience, I would say that weather/fog/lack of experience is the culprit. Lost of vision is the most critical case when running a helicopter you need to be really qualified because you need to pilot based only on instruments. Distinguish left from right becomes almost impossible (that's no exaggeration). If the last message sent by the air traffic controller is indeed"You are too low" (which means he can not provide you guidance anymore)  everything matches (fog / misreading on instruments...lead to crash). I don't want to throw shades on the pilot and pray for him/her, but even LAPD Police had grounded their fleet. If best pilots / ex military are saying "To complicated to fly that day" I let you imagine if the pilot was just not enough prepared.
 

I've been thinking about writing this (and where to put it) since yesterday. The folks here at [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA/) seemed like the right place. Just a way for my to cope with all the things that have happened.

Kobe Bean Bryant

You are someone who few have met, most have not and yet your life has affected us all. You were part of the social fabric that connected everyone and in the moment we lost you, the world reverberated from the shock wave. The bedrock of humanity felt you and your daughter leave. An entire global community mourns together.

Your name gave meaning to the meaningless. Put away trash, say Kobe and now it's meaningful. Only Kobe could make tube socks deeper than just laundry. Uttering Mamba Mentality when faced with a challenge gives millions on this planet the strength to keep going. Our global family underestimated how connected we were because of you.

Kobe *is* perseverance.

While we all grieve the loss of a transcendent human and father, I look ahead to the celebration of Kobe Bryant. His legend on the court and off will live on in the memories of people for generations. His tenacity on the court will energize young and old players alike. His care of everyone will soften the hearts of complete strangers. His story telling will echo through countless conversations.

His love of his daughter will be a beacon of love for dad's like me.

I never have met you Kobe Bean Bryant, but I am thankful to have you in my life.
Maybe once every 9 days or so, I'll just stop being productive for the day because I'll just be thinking about you which leads me down a YouTube rabbit hole of your highlights, interviews, etc. Today is one of those days. Throughout all of the chaos going on right now, we still think about you.
His daughter died too man wtf

Today is horrible
TMZ just reported that Gianna died too.. RIP this is so horrible
I was watching the Raps come out for their game with SAS. Everyone just looks completely dazed. Nobody wants to be playing right now. 

I can’t imagine how DeMar feels. Kobe was his idol.
Kobe will be unanimous induction into Hall of Fame and he deserves every vote.
[deleted]
Always thought he die in his sleep of natural causes when he was in his 80s but never something this awful. He was being a great dad and also  gonna do so many great things after his NBA career
Magic Johnson announced to the world on November 7th, 1991 that he had HIV. I was only 8 years old at the time but I remember everyone else considering it a death sentence and that we should respect the time left he had.

Imagine trying to tell someone on that date that not only would there be a future Laker joining the team in five years that won the same number of championships as Magic but also died before him. This day has been so surreal and I still cannot wrap my head around it.
I have a feeling that this is going to change the tone of the NBA for the rest of the year. The all-star game is going to take on a different context. If the Clippers and Lakers get to the WCF then that will also take on a different tone, probably a much less hostile tone. If ANY LA team wins the chip then the parade is going to be ridiculous.

Truly, your favorite player's favorite player. This is true even if he was your favorite player lol rest easy legend #8 #24
Saying “Kobe!” will never be the same....
And now I'm forever gonna wonder what his HoF speech would've been like...
Never in my life have I cared about a celebrity death before... Now I'm here holding back tears, RIP god mamba
I don't know if I can properly express how I feel in a single comment, but I will say this: He inspired me to be proud of my own competitive nature, not to be ashamed by it, but to own it. Without a doubt, to say that I am sad is an understatement. I am heartbroken, devasted. But, I want to be strong. I want to move forward wearing the inspiration he gifted me like armor. I think that's the kind of thing he'd want.

Rest In Peace to one of the greats. May his legacy continue to inspire others who inspire others.
Damn, Doc Rivers breaking down in tears during his press conference. No idea how these guys are just supposed to go out and play right now.
Famous or non famous, who ever the other 4 are, it's terrible that there is more people then we thought
Here are the last communications between the helicopter pilot and air traffic control.  It's the top entry on the page

https://www.liveatc.net/recordings.php  

Unless you're a pilot it won't make much sense to you but I did pick up that they had been holding due to IFR conditions, meaning they needed to rely on instruments to get to their destination rather than being able to see where they were going.
The last update: Altobelli, his wife and daughter. Their whole family are gone. That is just unbelievable.

Edit: They are survived by one son and one daughter
Everytime I get a couple minutes when I can get my mind on to something else, I read the headline somewhere again, and every single time I still can't believe it.

It's like a I'm waiting for it to be announced as a false report.
I just crumbled a paper and tossed it in the trash and said Kobe instinctively. Now I am too sad to even walk over and pick up the missed shot
At least once every 10 min today I keep re-reading the words “Kobe has died”and i still cannot process. Not sure I ever will
I keep going on Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and looking up things about Kobe. I don't really know what I'm hoping to find or to get out of it but I can't stop. It's just so sad, especially because it seemed he was really loving life post-retirement.
RIP Gianna as well. too much life ahead of her
His 13 year old daughter was with him 😢 Rip
I'm only 20 and never got a chance to watch some greats like Jordan, Bird, Magic etc... But you were one of the greats in your era, and I thank you for all the joy you brought to me watching you play the game of basketball, and everything  I ever saw you do in and outside the court. 

You worked hard for what you achieved and never surrendered, even in the last few seasons when your body started giving up on you, you were still the Black Mamba.

I will always remember how I skipped the first 2 classes of school, because of your retirement game that was covered at around 5:30 in the morning in my country. I skipped the d*mn school just to watch you do it one last time, and boy did you show up that day. 

You've influenced a lot of people to look up to you and follow your ways. You will never be forgotten. Thank you Kobe, for everything. May you find peace in your rest.

[RIP MAMBA](https://imgur.com/ftoei3w)
Shaqs reaction is going to fuckin break me.
It sounds trivial but as I was working the Spurs vs Raptors game today, I work for
Spurs sports and entertainment. I thought of how Kobe always destroyed us. 

Then I thought of his kids losing him, and how heartbreaking it was. Then the news came about out Gianna when they were about to do the moment of silence and 24 second tribute by the Raptors and Spurs and I teared up. I'm not an emotional person but he meant so much to the NBA and fans. The arena mood was somber and quiet the majority of the game to say the least. 

The last thing I thought today as we were finishing up and counting out was how next year was going to be the best HOF class ever with him, Duncan, KG and others and now he's gone.
I'd like to put [this](https://youtu.be/y64OsZNYhp0) out here. My 2 cents in honoring the legend.
Toronto's CN Tower is currently Purple & Gold for Kobe [https://twitter.com/canucksaz/status/1221569249879252996](https://twitter.com/canucksaz/status/1221569249879252996)
I hope LA makes August 24th Kobe Bryant Day.
I’m here from /r/hockey and I just wanted everyone to know we are all tapping out sticks on the ice for Kobe.  He was a legend, RIP.

I feel for his family during this difficult time.
I haven’t cried for years man but I just watched ‘Dear Basketball’ again and let me tell you, I need a new box of tissues.
Ever since I got the news. I tried to continue on with my day. Initiate the mamba mentality to prove past troubles. However I keep coming back,  still in denial. Tragedy strikes everywhere. Everyone in that accident had life to live.
I can’t stop thinking about the “another player and parent” and the fifth on board (the pilot?).

On one hand, their families aren’t going to get the support and messages that the Bryant family is getting and should continue to get. On the other, they will get to mourn in peace and privacy. 

I don’t know which is preferable, but it’s a choice I wish none of them had to make.
MSNBC just called it the LA N word's

What that actual fuck

I hate when people try to be funny or troll during moments like these. Just saw my cousin make an incredibly tasteless joke on FB, unfriended his ass immediately
Highlights the fragility of life. Kobe was invincible. A winner through and through. Gigi was young and had the world at her feet. Gone in a flash.

Live in the moment.

>Neymar just dedicated his 2nd goal of the night to Kobe.
A wikipedia search will give you all Kobe's accolades and accomplishments on paper, but those numbers are only half the story because we didn't just get to watch Kobe we got to **experience** Kobe. The man had that aura that special something that can't be taught, even if you weren't a Laker fan you'd be lying to yourself if you said you weren't a Kobe fan on some level...One of the craziest things about this whole scenario is that i can’t believe were not going to hear Kobe’s hall of fame speech, i was looking forward to that so much...let alone his memoir getting to hear his narrative of the ups and downs of his life and career how the mamba mentality was forged. I was so excited for life after basketball for Kobe, I   mean the man won an Oscar a year or two out of retiring not to mention his multiple venture capital deals and other projects i'm sure he was working on...it just doesn't feel real 

R.I.P Kobe
For anyone curious, a Sikorsky S-76 Helicopter can take up to 14 people including two pilots.
Is there confirmation his wife and three daughters are safe? After they announced 9 people died I began to panic.
I'm even more heart broken now when I realize we will never hear Kobe's HOF speech.
Somebody said “We will never hear Kobe Bryant’s hall of fame speech” and that’s what got me. Tell somebody you love them today none of this shits guaranteed.
Seen a guy walking down the street in Detroit tonight with a Kobe jersey on....no matter what state, city or country, if you loved basketball then you at most respected Kobe and what he brought and has done for the game
6 hours later and the headline still sounds unbelievable.
Oscar winner. Fervent WNBA supporter. Wholehearted dad. Multi-lingual intelligent mind. His work off the court qualifies him as one of our best — and then when you remember the greatness he achieved as a player, it’s amazing we witnessed his life. Thank you for uplifting us all, Kobe Bryant.
Saddened by the death of Kobe but I'm more saddened about those 2 young girls. Can't stop picturing what their final moments could've been like.
I’m a little more sad that the daughter died. I mean Kobe experienced greatness, he had done more than most people have. But the daughter was so young, barely a teenager. She dreamt of playing in the WNBA.
I’ve been gutted all day, crying on and off. Barely left my room. A celebrity death has never affected me like this until now. Just no reasoning for this one. No words. May him and his daughter rest in power.
This has to be the biggest NBA news ever . Right?
Woj just confirmed it :/
Fuck man. He was just nominated for the Hall of Fame and was going to be inducted later this year. 

This might be the most devastating event in NBA history. 

Worse than Len Bias. Worse than Reggie Lewis. Worse than the PR from Magic coming out with HIV or this off-season China bullshit. 

Only Roberto Clemente comes close in my mind and I'm in my mid 30s and Kobe was retired. Fuck, man.

Basketball needed Kobe's voice for much longer than through earlier this morning. Fuuuuuuuck.
How many people have ever taken a shot or thrown something in a garbage can from 10 feet away while crying out "KOBE!" for effect? I know I have a lot. He's had an indelible impact on a lot of lives. I'm sad to hear that this legend had to go out like this, and even more so that children are involved.
Has it been confirmed that Kobe's other daughters are alive? Because the fact 9 people might have been on board has got me fearing an even worse scenario for the family...
His wife and 3 of his daughters did survive. Prayers to them for losing a father and sister.
It’s really hard for me to process the fact that we’re never gonna see an old man Kobe 😭
How fucking bizarre and heartbreaking this is. Just yesterday he was tweeting at LeBron congratulating him for passing him in all time scoring and this morning he is dead. Heartbreaking.
 [This](https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MTU3MDIyNjI0NDkwNzY5/michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-all-star-gamejpg.jpg) is my favourite basketball photo ever. 41 years old is far too young.

RIP Kobe.

Just one day this year I want to wake up and have that day be better than those that preceded.
I've been staring at news, threads, and videos for hours. I still can't believe it. It's going to take more than a day to process this. I can't imagine what its like for his family. 

I remember after losing my uncle years ago, I'd often wake up and forget what had happened for a few blissful seconds.
It was an honour to have 81 scored on us
Kobe and Shaq were supposed to grow old together. Glad they got to have their sit down a couple years ago, if not just for them but for us too. RiP.
[Kobe Bryant, the conductor of our hearts](https://youtu.be/pB7P7OqCpqo)
I can't handle that his daughter died with him.  This is too much.
Has anyone else just been unable to do anything today? I had plans for today but lost all motivation after this news.
I've literally just been sat here wallowing in pity and sadness for hours man. Kobe made me fall in love with the game, he was/is my favorite player ever. I've never felt this low in my life.
is it weird to cry about someone you have never met before? I've never felt this way about a famous person dying, just seeing what he has accomplished and what it meant to other NBA players was too much for me
Honestly I'm still in denial.

For the younger generation, especially athletes/aspiring athletes.... this is that “where were you when ___________ happened” moment. Like with 9/11 etc. I will never forget this whole day
Kobe: "People always see me and say, you need a boy to carry on your legacy! Gigi is like, "Nah, I got this"

Damn man :(
This has been the worst day ever
After reflecting a bunch today, one thing really hit home towards the end of the day. The blazers announcer, Kevin Collabro, mentioned that he was proud to be a part of the the nba family today and part of the game. I know there was alot of controversy about whether or not the games should have been played but that moment really hit home with me because what he was trying to express was what I've been feeling and couldn't really explain. I don't fault and actually commend those who choose to step out of some games, like Kyrie, but for others this can be a great outlet.


When a family member or friend dies, we tend to gather at their home or with our families to mourn and reflect. Today, a lot of us felt lost. Hell, i rooted against kobe my whole life but I felt like I lost someone I knew. I was talking about it with my friends but we all felt kind of strange and surreal. Seeing the players or coaches, like Doc and Melo, seeing the 24 second violations, seeing the crowds gather around the country and honor him, that was a way that helped me and many others process their feelings, reflect on it with our nba community, which although we are nobodies - this stuff takes up so much of my time and mental energy, it felt like I needed to be "with" others who did the same. It's the same reason I want to see Lakers and clippers - not because I care about who wins, I watched all the games today kind of numb. But because its our chance to be "with" our nba friends, reflect together, and mourn together.
This is by far the biggest celebrity death so far in my life. Rest In Peace, you brought SO many people joy and happiness.
His career and legendary 81 point game will live on forever. He lived and died as a champion. RIP
China is going to be waking up to this in the next hour or so. He is fucking beloved in China
Just realized that we’re not getting the HoF speech this year. Fuck this hurts.

NBA loses David Stern and Kobe Bryant within a month of each other, tough start to 2020.
Just read the Woj/TMZ update regarding Gianna

oh my god...
I dont know about anyone else but Kobe has been the reason that I run. To me he was a demigod. A force of nature unwilling to give up no matter the odds. Someone who would force the universe to obey him. Everytime I broke my lap time I had the words "if it were Kobe, he'd run even faster and harder." I was just a kid man. A kid who worshipped this unreachable demigod. He may have passed but his undeniable work ethic and competitive spirit (fuck he was just shit talking Luka in Slovenian the other day) will live on.

Live on Kobe Bryant. 

In our hearts and minds. 

Live on.

R.I.P.
Fuck, the "Kobe" chants in the Raptors Spurs game really got to me
https://twitter.com/ssjreef/status/1221531785273569280?s=21
You just know in his last moments he wasn't thinking about himself at all, he thought about his daughter.
This is the worst celebrity death I’ve experienced, it’s awful. Don’t know why the NBA is playing games right now.
I live in Orange County & worked years ago at a popular outdoor mall in Newport Beach where Kobe would frequent with his daughters.


The shop I worked in was right next to an Auntie Anne’s & I would go there often to get a Diet Coke during my shift.


Well one day I walk up not really paying any attention to the world around me. I’m standing at the counter when I notice a rather large man next to me in the corner of my eye. I do double-take when my brain realizes that I’m standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Kobe Bryant who is asking the Auntie Anne’s guy whether his daughter’s pretzel is ready.


We make eye contact & I ask him how’s it 
going. We made small talk for ~30 seconds while the guy checked the oven for him & I got my Diet Coke. There was a known but unspoken rule at this mall that employees don’t confront Kobe or his wife (she was a much more common sight) but I couldn’t resist striking up a polite conversation. I didn’t dare ask for a photo or autograph or anything although I do think he would have acquiesced based on his temperament at that moment.


RIP Kobe. Thanks for being nice to me that one time. I promise I won’t forget it any time soon.
I'm fucking crushed, and I'm 41. I shouldn't be crying for another man. 

I have a white 24 jersey that I bought at the Staples when my family visited LA. Because I live in a Laker-hating town, I've had more negative interactions than good ones that I rarely used it in public. That I know will change. 

I was 17 when he was drafted, obviously we're the same age. 

I've always said,  I am Lakers fan first. Kobe fan second. But I've defended and  rooted for this man even at  his lowest points, the all-white pictorials. 

I was wrong. I'm a Kobe Stan. 

I love you Kobe Bean. Got bless you Gianna.
ESPN2 playing his retirement video and I'm in shambles
This is seriously some of the most tragic deaths in the history of sports. I’m all broken up about this. 

Bro, his daughter y’all. She was 13. Kobe was only 41. Damn.
This is the hardest hitting premature death since at least Tupac
I don’t mean to sound messed up but I hope that they passed away not suffering. God this fucking blows.
In an absolute millisecond, life can change.
Love unconditionally, respect willingly, be grateful accordingly.

RIP Gigi, Kobe and the rest.
Prayers up to the families affected.

F*ck! I still cannot believe it.
They just brought Boyz II Men out at the Grammys for a Kobe tribute...that got the tears flowing
It's crazy to think that Kobe's newborn daughter will only know her own father the same way as we, the fans, do. She'll know him as a public figure and will hear all the amazing things that people tell her about her father, but will never know him as a real person. It's incredibly sad and very mind-warping.
I think it's important to keep in mind that while the sporting world has lost one of its biggest icons, the family just lost Dad.

It's a short 15 second video, one of my favorite kobe moments.

I bleed green. If you were to tell me I’d be toasting Kobe and his family on my birthday before today, I’d never believe it. I hope for the best for his family, and I’ll finally admit it, you are one of the very greatest to ever play.
I am a Los Angeles native born and raised. I am almost 30... Kobe has been a constant for the majority of my life. This feels surreal
[deleted]
Kobe Bryant is literally the last fucking person any fan would expect to die. He is known *specifically* for the way he attacked life. It really is beyond belief. Such a sobering reminder that no second on earth should be taken for granted.
[deleted]
I feel for Vanessa Bryant and Natalia. I just can’t imagine sleeping, eating, showering... doing anything normal after losing two family members.
That report that his family wasnt on board doesn't exist anymore
>
>3:26 [[Wainwright] Sources have confirmed that neither #Bryant’s wife or children were on board of the helicopter that crashed.] (https://twitter.com/AWainwrightTV/status/1221526799542255616)
It's like Superman dying.
I saw on twitter someone had the kinda silly but also cute idea for a tribute for Kobe. Next day where all 30 teams play, cancel all the games that day. 81 game season for the teams.
The person who responded to the Magic tweet who felt the need to insist that Kareem is the best Laker of all time is the reason Twitter fucking sucks.  On here that idiot would rightly be downvoted into oblivion for his impeccably bad timing.
If there’s 5 dead there’s no way the pilot, Kobe, Fox, and all four daughters were on board.
Kobe and his 13 year old daughter Gianna have passed away. Rick Fox wasn’t on board and it appears neither were his other 3 daughters. Be careful what you read and only trust reliable sources like Woj for example.
Man another parent and their kid was onboard too. So awful
I don't think a celebrity death has ever affected me like this. I can't believe it.
I cannot fathom what Vanessa and the rest of his family is going through. Omg man
I haven’t cried since my mom died in 2016. Knowing Kobe died with his daughter when I’m raising one of my own, just fucking breaks me.
From yelling “Kobe” when shooting garbage into the bin at school to showing the kids I coach game film; he’s never truly gone, rip a legend
[Shaq reacts to death of Kobe on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zE-AelO-q/?igshid=eswe9bh9mrhh)
I'm hearing now that his daughter, Gianna, was also aboard. 

I am so saddened by this tragedy, not only because of the legacy it brings to an end, but the legacy it also stopped from being.

Kobe had as much to offer, if not more, in his retirement years than he did during his career.  I'm talking as a father, business mogul, coach and charitable human being.

Kobe is one of those few that transcends the sport. You love him or respect him, regardless if you're a Lakers fan or not.

As a Raptors fan, I watched him drop 81 against the Raptors.  I also watched in inspiration and shock as he dropped 60 points and led the Lakers to a comeback victory against Utah in his final game.

He was a massive reason the number 24 became my favorite number, as it was also my day of birth and the number of several major sports players at the time (Kobe, Ramirez (MLB), Chelios, McCabe (NHL)). Heck, the number is used in all of my usernames to this day.

Love, respect and condolences to anybody whose lives were touched by Kobe.  RIP. Mamba4Life.
In the press conference the Sheriff says there were NINE people on board. Not five.
9 people?!!
9 people, fuck. Awful. 

Given where they were going, I'm hoping against hope that it's not more kids.
I’m a Celtics fan but Kobe has always been my favorite player. I loved his game, his mentality, his style. He inspired me, motivated me. He was my role model. Thank you Kobe for everything you have done for me and this world, may you, Gianna, and whoever else was on that helicopter rest in peace. 
My prayers go out to Kobe’s family and also the families of the other victims.
I loved hating Kobe. Can't believe this is all too real. I feel like imma throw up.

EDIT: spelling
I’m usually pretty even keeled in celebrity deaths. After all I don’t know these people but this is honestly devastating. And his daughter too. I’m sick.
Im 33 now. As a blazers fan from his era he crushed me so many times.

But holy shit do i respect him. I worked for nike from 18-27 and i sat down and thought, without realizing, Kobe literally shaped my early to mid adulthood based solely on my profession. The events and seedings that i did, my friends in LA that I had we all worked for Nike Entertainment... I never thought about that til today. I was with my wife grocery shopping today and i reminisced about my early life and Kobe as much as I despised how he killed us shaped me. I dropped tears for him today.

I respect him as a loyal warrior to the Lakers for his whole career and the family man he strived to be. Kobe retired and was just living his best life for his family and loving it. 

His daughter Gianna, you never got to be what you were destined for. I mourn for you.

This is a unique feeling, never knew Kobe influenced me this much but he did.
I have never experienced this sort of reaction from a celebrity death. It’s just too much man.
[deleted]
He's not supposed to go out like this. He's supposed to get super old so we can tell young kids "Boy I wish you'd seen him when" when they ask who Kobe Bryant was. 

He's supposed to be around for his HOF induction, telling us all the stories we haven't heard before. It shouldn't be like this man...what the fuck
I made this [illustration in 2015](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7y6zgSJpvC/) and it just feels poignant as ever today #mambaforever
Basketball heaven players are shaking in their shoes. Kobe and Gigi are never getting off that court.

I am 46 years old and a lifelong Celtics fan.  I've shed more tears today than I'd like to admit.  My heart breaks for the families and the tragic losses of life.
Saddest day in NBA history
Growing up i only had one poster on my wall.

It was you, mamba.

Rip Kobe.
I was raised by my mother, my father, and Kobe Bryant. 

He wasn’t a perfect man, but no one is meant to be. He was my hero because he made no excuses. He held others to a higher standard, but measured himself against it first. He put his entire being into whatever he was working on- his game, his marriage, his interests. When he erred, he put that same all-encompassing work ethic to find a way to right his wrongs. 

He doesn’t need to be remembered or revered as a God or legend. He was a person who personally meant the world to me. And to lose him and his daughter in this manner is devastatingly sad. And is even sadder for the other families who’s loss will be in this dark shadow. 

It’s should’ve been anyone else. Or no one.
Although I've never got to meet Kobe in real life, and never will, I'm certain he will be disappointed at me knowing I spent today unfocused and unhappy, without motivation. It was supposed to be a day of good mood, a weekend of celebrating me turning another year older. But thank you kobe, for reminding me what I have to do in life.

Life is too precious to mess around.
I live in LA, and let me tell you...we are all hurting and you can FEEL it. It’s so monotone and quiet and no one feels like doing anything. So many people crying everywhere. LA will never be the same. I’m not even a big NBA fan but man kobe was it, the lakers early 2000 were it. I didn’t think this loss along with his daughter and the others on the helicopter would affect me this much. 

Horrible. I feel so bad for his wife and family.
Can't sleep because I keep imagining what Vanessa and the kids are going through and thinking about right now.

I generally never understood why people got emotional over celebrity deaths without actually knowing the person, but this has absolutely destroyed me emotionally. I know everyone's already said it but it really does feel absolutely surreal, like even the idea that we will never see Kobe..or Gigi again is incomprehensible.
Man i tell you i just woke up and my first thought was if Kobe is really dead? I'm still in denial
This is still brutally sad.
I'm in my late night feelings right now. Still seeing "Kobe Bryant passed away at age 41" it's just weird, makes you feel like your in another universe.
saddest day in NBA history, man.

Gone way too soon
Two children have died. 

Kobe's death is shocking, the other kid's parent's death is tragic as is (presumably) the pilot's. 

But when it's two young girls as well, there are absolutely no words. Just horrendous. 

The world can be unspeakably cruel sometimes.
[deleted]
13 years old man, so damn heartbreaking. As a new father this shit rips my heart out
“Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.”
Gigi too, Jesus Christ I can't believe this

Rest in peace sunshine
http://globoesporte.globo.com/ge/videos/v/marcelinho-lamenta-falecimento-de-kobe-bryant-em-acidente/8267259/ 

i know this is random but in brazil tiago splitter spoke and said kyrie is inconsolable and in despair crying
As a lifelong Spurs fan and an avid Laker hater he made me more frustrated than anyone I’ve ever watched play basketball. I hated watching the Spurs play the Lakers because of Kobe. Look at me now, I am so sad about this. You truly never realize how good something is until it’s gone forever. Rest In Peace  Mamba. You were an amazing talent, legend and an absolute brilliant picture in redemption.
I've been in tears since the news broke, thoughts and prayers to Vanessa and the rest of their family. I'm broken.
A reminder on how fucking fragile life is. Kobe was supposed to build a business empire. Be there for another Lakers championship parade. Be it one lead by LeBron or some other in the future. He was supposed to shit talk all the visiting young players for years to come. Creep back into the NBA as a coach/GM/owner eventually.   

Gigi shared the same passion for basketball has his father. The Mamba's successor. She could have been the face of women's basketball. But what's worse she was 13. I remember when I was 13. There are so so so many things a 13 year old hasn't experienced and lived through yet. All that gone in a blink of an eye. 

RIP to everyone that was on board. To everyone else, give someone a hug today.
His short film is worth rewatching.
