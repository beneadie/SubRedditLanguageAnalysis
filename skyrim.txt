So, I got Skyrim running on my keyboard.

Shhh!!! Don’t give Todd any more port ideas!!!
He spent so long trying to figure out if he could, he never stopped to think if he should
Anyone know what keyboard that is and what the point of the display is?
#You’re finally awake.
That's exactly what I was missing in my life: 

**Skyrim for Keyboard**
Disappointing, I expected it to run on the per-key backlighting :(
There is a point where we needed to stop and we have clearly passed it, but let's keep going and see what happens.
Is this how veteran Doom players feel when they hear someone got it working on a toaster?
To those saying it's a gif or vid, I used this program:  https://github.com/wolfinabox/Steelseries-OLED-Display-Mirror through the Steel Series Engine 3 app. It is mirroring my screen while the game is run in window mode.

The keyboard is the Steel Series Apex 7 TKL.

Shout out to my SO for getting the keyboard for my bday, you know who you are.
$59.99 Keyboard Edition
Now we need a full Let's Play.
Todd, I know it's you. And you're drunk, go home.
Bethesda needs to chill with these ports
SAVAGE
This seems to be the Return of the obra dinn: Skyrim edition.
For anyone getting overly exited.

It's not running on the keyboard. It's a gif.
Why no one actually asks about how it works? Are you just using the keyboard to display the game or are you actually running the game? Or is it a joke and a big woosh for me?

If it's like that guy who said he was running doom on a pregnancy test but turns out he was just using the display well... bleh.
Wtf
GODDAMIT TODD

YOUVE DONE IT AGAIN
just when I thought I’d seen it all
Putting that RTX3080 to good use I see.
“Damn bro. Nice set up! Got the new 3080 and everything. But uh. Where’s your monitor?” 
“Got a sick .01k display, check out next gen Skyrim”
Can someone make Skyrim on toaster, where every farm is imprinted on one toast each.
TODD HOWARD WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
But /r/willitrundoom ?
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch! You really did it!
Probs get better load times than consoles lmao
This is the way
Skyrim has more ports than Quake.
No, you just got an animated inage to run on your keyboard.  Stop bullshitting.
What the fuck
I mean, Spelling would be very easy on that version...
Its juts works!
I don't know where we're going....but Sovngarde awaits.
Why you would do this is beyond me
r/MechanicalKeyboards
Me to Todd Howard : Don't even think about it
Todd Howard, you've done it again, you magnificent bastard
But can it run Doom?!??
Do doom eternal next.
Yo dawg, I heard you liked Skyrim! So we put Skyrim on the keyboard, so you could Skyrim while you Skyrim.
Holy fucking shit dude.
Cool!
Yeah, but can it run **Doom**???
Now throw 255 mods in it
When they said to play Skyrim on pc this is not what they meant.
I guess I’ll just never be able to keep up with new tech. Since when have they been putting screens on keyboards😂
I totally thought the keyboard was going to be the screen.
I bet Todd Howard is so hard rn
These got a lot less impressive when I learned how it’s actually done
Now we need a nerd to finish the game on the keyboard.
I disagree.
I think you got your keyboard running as a display rather than Skyrim running on your keyboard.
Is it actually running or just a video?
I can’t even get it to run on my PC, let alone my keyboard.
We have reached the apex of human advancement.
It just works.

~Todd Howard
is it sad that i want to play this version
What's next? Running Skyrim on your fridge?
good luck finding the Stones of Barenziah  on that thing
Only real men can picture the actual scene in their head
play doom on it
There is a point where we needed to stop and we have clearly passed it


BUT LETS KEEP GOING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Alright Todd you can go back to your main reddit account now, you can't fool us any more.
This might be the coolest thing I've ever seen. Holy shit.
Dude, if you could beat it tho? Like holy shit, call guinness:

1) First person to play a game on an actual keyboard.

2) First person to beat a game on an actual keyboard.

3) First person to play Skyrim on an actual keyboard.

4) First person to beat Skyrim on an actual keyboard.

Thats 4 world records, totally worth the struggle. And I mean cmon, its not like its hard. By now pretty much anyone can run you through the entire main quest line step by step.
How much longer will humanity play god?
Got here because of a news article.
Good. We have a new meme template.
"I got Slyrim running"

You got a gif running
But can it run Crysis?
You got skyrim *displaying* on your keyboard.
You're finally awake
What type of keyboard do you have?
Did it crash?
Bruh
You madman
What the fuck
Screw it! I’m gonna go play Skyrim
Todd you've done it again!
Next Skyrim inside Skyrim
I have a question to God, WHYYY?
Holy shit
I’m not sure if being impressed is enough! This is fucking amazing!
is skyrim the new doom?
The sonuvabitch really did it again!
skyrim is the new doom, i guess
Dang Imagine programming it in to have a health, magicka and stamina bar displayed with the rgb and while in the inventory, whatever you're hovering over will start to be spelled out on the keys. May even be a playable experience at that point
Todd Howard would be proud
You just gave the coward his next idea for Skyrim special special addition
Because its just works on everything I bet I can put skyrim in a birthday cake and it will get me to windhellm
YOO
Port it to my brain with the chip elon musks created
Don’t tell Todd Howard. 🤫
I have heard of madlads in the past but this....
YOU DID 

#***W H A T ? ! ? !***
Yo dawg, I heard you like playing Skyrim...
Does Todd's madness know no bounds???
u/savethisvideo
"Next up: Pregnancy Test Edition"
Damn one more thing I gotta buy it for
They said it couldn’t be done.
Mad lad
But at what cost
What keyboard also how the hell did you even do that?
HOLD!
Yet again Todd Howard has found a new platform to sell Skyrim
Now do an entire playthrough
Now a home pregnancy test!
Wow...
The newest edition!
r/itrunsskyrim
This is right up there with Doom playing on a pregnancy test, of things i want but truly do not need.
my, god.

&#x200B;

Madman. This is hilarious.
Looks to me more like a little GIF for your little keyboard screen and some nice little moving lights🤫
Damnit, again Todd? *opens wallet*
Skyrim became the new Doom lol.
How?
The graphics my PC can handle lol
Right that really cool but whyyy
Mitten Squad: Can you beat Skyrim using only a keyboard?
And I can't get it to run in my laptop cuz my shit's too nice
I got the exact same keyboard! Could you link me the oled gif?
#Todd wants to know your location
Ok now complete it like this lol.
How many Skyrim Characters are there to collect > ?
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SOMEONE STOP TODD!!
But can it run Doom?
Red pilled.
Skyrim on an abacus next!
Now you can finally do what humans are meant to, constantly play Skyrim I’ve and over forever.
I feel like this is how it's meant to be played
How do I save videos on iPhone?
GOD DAMMIT TODD! You can't keep getting away with iiiiiiit!
but can it run Doom
I crave that keyboard I’ve seen ads for it and it looks sick but the price is pretty high
Now beat the game that way
Now add mods.
This is how I imagine the second generation of bionic vision (for blind folks getting the implants) will look like.

Just enough detail to navigate and appreciate some outlines in the environment.

But, that aside and to get back on-topic, LULZ!
This must be how Skyrim on a TI-83 looks.
When do I get my TI-83 Plus version?
Still waiting for it on my smart fridge, credit card machines and gas pumps.
FUS RO DAHT MATRIX!
"my five year old laptop plays this, my calculator can get me to Whiterun, and I'm sure if I put it in a cheesecake it would at least boot the loading screen!"
How? TELL ME!!!
That's awesome brother
Time for Mitten Squad to beat Skyrim like this
You're finally asdfghjkl
How the fuck?
Yeah, but can it run mods?
A video of Skyrim.
wtf
This is what games should be. Transcend all boundaries.
Now beat the game
how
Looks like it can be done with this: [https://github.com/wolfinabox/Steelseries-OLED-Display-Mirror](https://github.com/wolfinabox/Steelseries-OLED-Display-Mirror)

I have the same keyboard, but honestly pretty meh, can't be arsed to check if it works when there are only 2 colors (white or black).
You can get Skyrim to run on a keyboard and I can’t even get it to run on my goddamn MacBook.
I want skyrim for android lol
Todd be praised!
Todd would be proud.
\*softly "dont"
yeah but can it run Doom?
Looks like an ultrasound. "Its a boy!" How TF can you tell??
Damn that’s cool, but can it run Crysis?
that’s dope. Skyrim is a goat game
It’s playing an animation. The game is not playable on this screen.
Is Skyrim the New Doom ?
Dammit, Todd!!! I thought I told you to stop re-releasing Skyrim!!!
MSFT coming for ya
What. the. actual. fuck.
Why?
finally
Todd would like to know your location
Fair play! This is sick mate.
Honestly I’ve never once bought Skyrim, I rented it from blockbuster and it took me around 3 hours to create my character and I didn’t really get past the initial area after the executions lol 

It was a 2 day rental and it was on 360 so I honestly wasn’t impressed and haven’t touched it since. I am waiting for the right moment to play it modded the fuck out. 

Maybe when it comes out for LG refrigerators I’ll play it
what kind of keyboard do you have? Is it mechanical?
ok but honestly i need that gif i have the same keyboard
*L e g e n d a r y*
Let me just boot up Skyrim on my flashlight.
Now beat the game on it
Howard's ears are burning right now and he doesn't know what for
that's it, erase todd. OP, you're now in charge
Damn it I got skyrimmed by a keyboard
Sick 👏
Im so mad about this
But can it run doom?
Can’t even run on Mac lol 😂 but here we have this
Is it interactive or did you just play a movie on it?
But, can it okay Doom?
When ur keyboard is powerful as ur computer
WTF
No wonder Microsoft bought them off
Is this a Logitech g15?
Just...how...?
[deleted]
Lmao now they can finally start elders six
Fuck off todd howard
This is getting out of hand...
Visuals remind me of Obra Dinn
So this is how you play Skyrim at work huh
Doom can run on an electronic pregnancy test. Do that next!
Bitch what
Skyrim for switch.
You can run skyrim on a keyboard but I cant get it to run on a laptop from 2012.
I assume you’ve got DOOM running on it as well?
Dude this is awesome
Todd Howard you’ve done it again
*Todd Howard has entered the chat*
Get out
This reminds me of UpIsNotJump's vid of saying if he put the game into a cake he could probs get to the loading screen as a joke lmao
Surely a streamer has finished a game like this already
But can it run a Crysis gif?
Yoo I think I have the same keyboard as you, how do I make it display like that?
You're acting like this was a difficult thing to do.
Where can I get in of these
Hey you, You're finally awake
You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there!
Damn you Stormcloaks, Skyrim was fine until you came along, Empire was nice and lazy, if they hadn't been looking for you i could've stollen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. 
You there, you and me we shouldn't be here, its these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now thief! 
Shut up back there!
What's wrong with him huh? 
Watch your tongue, you're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak the true high king!
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you.. Oh god where are they taking us?
I don't know where we're going, but Soverngard awaits. 
No. This can't be happening, this isn't happening! 
Hey what village are you from horse thief?
Why do you care? 
A Nords last thoughts, should be of home. 
Rorikstead I'm-I'm from Rorikstead.
General Tulius Sir! The headsman is waiting! 
Good lets get this over with. 
Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynerath, Akitash, Divines. Please help me. 
Look at him, General Tulius the Military Governor, and it looks like the Thalmor are with him, Damn elves i bet they had something to do with this.
Ah. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here, I wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with Juniper berries mixed in. 
Funny. When I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe. 
Who are they daddy? Where are they going? 
You need to go inside, little cub. 
Why? I want to watch the soldiers. 
Inside the house. Now! 
Woah! 
Yes papa. 
Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!
Why are we stopping?
Why do you think? End of the line.
Let's go, shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
No, Wait! We aren't rebels!
Face your death with some courage thief.
You got to tell them we weren't with you, this is a mistake!
Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time!
*Sighs* Empire loves their damn lists.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm. 
It has been a honor, Jarl Ulfric! 
Ralof of Riverwood. 
Lokir of Rorikstead. 
No! I'm not a rebel. You can't do this! 
HALT!
You're not going to kill me! 
Archers! 
Anyone else feel like running?
Wait you there step forward. 
Who are you? 
(Create character blah blah blah, Name charecter(You get the point))
You with one of the trade caravans Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble. 
Captain. He's not on the list. What should we do? 
Forget the list, he goes to the block. 
By your orders Captain. I'm sorry, we'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr. 
Follow the Captain prisoner. 
Ulfric Stormcloak, some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero doesn't use a power like the voice to murder his King and userp his throne. 
*Groans*
You started this war! Plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace. 
*Dragon roar*
What was that?
It's nothing. Carry on. 
Yes General Tulius. Give them their last rights.
As we commend your souls to Apherious, blessings of the eight devines upon-
For the love of Talos, shut up, and lets get this over with. 
As you wish. 
Come on! I haven't got all morning. 
My ancestors are smiling at me Imperials. Can you say the same? 
You Imperial B#######! 
Justice! 
Death to the Stormcloaks!
As fearless in death, as he was in life. 
Next the cat! 
*Dragon roar*
There it is again, did you hear that?
I said, next prisoner! 
To the block prisoner. Nice and easy. 
What in Oblivion is that?! 
Sentries. What do you see? 
It's in the clouds! 
Dragon!! 
*Dragon shouts*
Guards! Get the townspeople to safety! 
Hey Khajiit! Get up! Come on! The gods won't give us another chance! 


(This took about 30 mins to write and my fingers hurt kinda)
The lcd on the Gigabyte Auros Extreme/Master 3080/3090 is not safe....
You gotta be fucking kidding....take my upvote
Haha
Where’s your fridge and Alexa and how can I steal them?
I... What how?
This is so damn cool
God damnit, Todd.
Todd has fallen off the wagon
Dope.
Seems it ran fine until it took an arrow to the kneeboard.
Ohh come on😂😂😂 next do it with the pregnancy test 😆
Ayy you're same-keyboard-bros with me, although all I have on it is a smug Megumin
Man's a bloody legend
please don’t tell todd
How and why is this possible?
Todd Howard's erection intensifies.
Delet this
Just.... ***how***
Full play through
Todd would like to know your location
If you paralyze Wulfgar when he uses Whirlwind Sprint...

Crossbow poisoned with paralysis poison. A similar effect occurs if the Dragonborn eats netch jelly after using Whirlwind Sprint.

Edit: [Here's a montage of other crazy things to do in Skyrim.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27GAhUjRnvc)
The power of his Thu'um has propelled him to a higher plane of existence.
This is the best thing I'll see on Reddit today
So what you're saying is, if a skilled alchemist experimented a little with paralysis potions, they could make whirlwind sprint much more effective?
WULD NAH YEET
So does the gate just stay open?
Despite me already having a idea of what was going to happen, i still laughed out loud. Congrats!
At least someone got to see the Cloud District
Meanwhile, in Ivarstead: 

"What in Oblivion happened? Why is Bjorn dead!?"

"I don't know. He was walking along the road, and then some robed man came flying from the mountain and landed on top of him!"
“Yep that’s me, you must be wondering how I got here!”
yeet
r/gamephysics
Same thing happens if you wait one hour as he shouts
How long has this game been out? And I STILL play it and love it!
I love how Arngeir is just standing there, trying to process what happened
I audibly chuckled on this one
And they just didn't give a shit that you flat out shot one of their members
"Well, Brother Wulfgar won't be returning to us.. any time soon.."
FUS... yeee-EEET!!
WULD NAH KRESSSSSS-
That's whirlwind sprints secret 4th word "yeet"
Haha Once I realized you are the same OP as the guy with the cannonballing and how to i had to follow. This is incredible. Do more do more!
The other guy is like "yes this is normal"
This gets funnier the more times you watch it!
For anyone that cares, Wulfgar is a notable character in Forgotten Realms lore in RA Salvatore books:

[https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wulfgar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wulfgar)
"I used to be a gray beard, then I took an arrow to the back, got paralysed and fell down a mountain." - some guard in ESO6
This is actually a speed-run/fast travel trick that invloves paralyzing yourself as Whirlwind Sprint starts up. You can make consumable poisons to do this and fly around
Just as funny rewatching it
My dude said “Ight ima head out “
You have to let it all go, Dragonborn. Fear...doubt...and disbelief.
Free your mind...
This is a certified Hood Classic.
u/savevideo
The all powerful walter-fring blesses this subreddit once again
Wulfgone
Wulfgar is gonna need some milk 😳
So were you able to progress after this incident?
inertia is a property of matter
Haha wow... wait, are you a Blades sympathizer? BURN THE WITCH!
No u dint
So how badly does that break the quest?
Dragonborn go so fed up with the troll on the climb to High Hrothgar that he, in fact, became a troll.
Say hi to that frost troll on the way back up.
Fuck you wulfgar.
This is genius.
Oh man I’m high as hell and can’t stop laughing at this!!!! Ima go try this now. Gonna be up all night playing the Rim now!!!
Did he survive?
Do you have to wait for him to walk back up to complete the mission?
Never change skyrim
I’m the Dragonborn, and this is Jackass
Oh mah gawd :D I had to register on reddit just to like this post :D
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
nyoom
Aaaaaaannnndd he's gone lol
But try to paralyze him with a spell or such in the middle of the sprint. He turns into a housefly
Master Borri

Bex!

WULD—

*silence*
Hahaha
Omg I’m so old which is my only excuse to have just learned this.
An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside foh…..
Your videos make me laugh out loud more so than any others I have seen.
I fucking love this sub. lol
Wulfgar fuckin dies.
Ah yes, skyrim is a perfectly balances game with no glitches.
Oh, sing with me, sing for the year,
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear,
Sing it with me, if it's just for today,
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away,
Ah, I see the Greybeards have decided to begin competing with the Giants in the Great Skyrim Space Race.
We had to wait 9 years for this. and it was worth it.
It just works.
It's a bird... It's a dragon, it's Wulfgar!
I love love love the fact that even almost 10 years later, I'm still learning shit about this game.
This is so simple. It's classic comedy, and I can not stop laughing hysterically at it.
do you have many mods installed? Your game looks really good. I've been meaning to play Skyrim again these days but it just looks too bad ha
Haha graybeard go *ZOOOOOM*
This is one of my favorite Skyrim clips of all time. I gotta try this lmao
I'm now imagining him splatting in the next city over. And then getting up and slowly trekking back
I used to FusRohDah Paralyzed giants, just to see how far I could make them skip. This is so much funnier
Son of Beornegar!  King of the barbarian tribes of Icewind Dale!  Tempus!
One of my favourite things to do with this quest is to just sprint to the gate normally and they act as if you used whirlwind sprint.
What if you paralyze yourself in the middle of that, perhaps by eating an ingredient or potion?
You see, he was demonstrating what you should do when you accidentally shoot a chicken, you need to hightail the fuck outta there before the entire empire descends down upon you with 500 guards that for some god damn unholy reason are super strong, like I’m the Dragonborn and this bitch got shot in the knee but still 2 shots me on Adept difficulty. And then even if you do get to submit, they take your whole supply of “stolen” potions because potions are expensive and I don’t feel like eating 3000 flowers a day! Anyways, wulfgar is a good teacher
Nice choice of cross bow
I love you for this.
\[Shoting Stars music intensifies\]
Platinum because I haven't cried laughing in LONG time. I needed that.
This is definitely a feature instead of a bug
He is finally among the dragons.
All of this....  
JUST  
WORKS
Congratulations on making it to the 3rd most upvoted post on this sub.
This post has pushed me out of the top 20 all time in r/skyrim and I’m not even salty. This is excellent
It just works
r/MyPeopleNeedMe
3 days and you're already 3rd top post. Congrats man!
You’d think they’d be a little angry that you assassinated one of them by shooting an arrow into his neck mid spell, but no. What happened after this?
This is great.
See you in hot lol
Wulfgar? More like Wulfgone.
Aaaaaaaaand he's gone
Did he dieded?
Dude went Wulf-far
Oh man, that's hilarious.
My people need me!
Lmfao
Yup made my day.
This is the highest quality post of any kind I've ever seen on this sub. Thank you.
I ugly laughed at this. I shot some snot out of my nose.
That is brilliant!!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
And so Dovakin, last of the Dragonborn and leader of several guilds, faced 25 years for manslaughter.
Enjoy the climb back up!
Nice
I would love to see Graybeard bowling.
yeet
Crossbow is a mod right?
PFFFFFFFFTLMAO
This beard empty, yeet
You can also just sprint through the gate. I never actually used the shout
Fucking love this
Some say he's still out there somewhere... soaring majestically through the heavens.
That said, the clip is amazing lol
Skyrim is a flawless game lol
So does that break the quest?
Does Wulfgar return eventually?
Absolutely beautiful
yeet
A mod exists, it throws out random curse words, when NPC'S get thrown or catapulted. Can you imagine hearing Holllllllllllllyyyyyyy Shiiiiiiiiiit
aisjejfjg
LMFAO
This is important research!
I can't stop laughing
he said ZOOOOM
Wait, where do you get the crossbow?
I believe the first word of that shout is yeet
Oh my gods thats amazing
That was awesome!
Aight I'm bout to head out
My answer for "Why is skyrim the best game?"
Arngeir: *Master Wulfgar...?*
I literally lol'd 🤣
up up and away
that’s hilarious
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it's WULFGARD
"Wuld... Nah Yeet!" - Wulfgar, probably.
Wee
Wulfgon
Reminds me of Touch the Skyrim when they blasted one of the graybeards off the mountain with a ragdoll model then found him a few episodes later after turning the world into an oacean.
[When Wulfgar comes to:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZCvQ5J3pk)
The other monks look on in amused horror as they try not to laugh after the Dragonborn strolled in and casually yeeted one of them clear off a mountain.
He just YEETed himself
The 6th word of whirlwind sprint
u/vredditdownloader
Now this is quality content!
Ok this was pretty brilliant.
Where did he land though?
I don't play this game, is he dead on impact?
WULD.. NAH KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...
Having the dwarven crossbow before doing the main story lmao I'm not the only one
What happens next haha!?
I love that this works!
F
YEET
Fov 90
I love how the other Gray Watchers are like 'aight'
Do you get to the cloud district often?
PULL!
Thus is brilliant
YUH-EET!
Hahaha🤣
I was laughing way to loud because of this but thanks!
Yeet
Wuld ka Yeet
Sky guide him.
Yeet.png
Wulfgar: You dick.
Hey im new to skyrim but is that cross bow a mod?
Wulfgar getting yeeted:The game
"And I raaaan, I ran so far awayyyy! I just raaaan, I ran all night and daaaay!"
YEET!!
He got yeeted right the fuck outta there.
im so glad people are still finding things in this game
what a good way of ending 2020. watching this. amazign. 10/10
FusRohByeeeeeeee
Ice form shout also works here
Does....does he ever come back?
Wulfgar: YEET
Wulgar is the dragon born
same thing with slowing time and dodging in cyberpunk.    you can really get going fast if you do it right
No! What have you done?! Now I'm getting the urge to play Skyrim again, I thought I was done with this game after the last playthrough!
Let the voice of love
It's funny because the Greybeards are canonically the highest level entities in the game.
There he goes never to be seen again
Nice move OP. Nice move.
Yeet!
The voice of love is taking him higher
There he go
You should be a tester on the next Elder Scrolls game
A new visual for the "Aight im out" meme lmao
Bye, have a good time!
Wuuu~
Makes me wonder where he landed.
I haven't played the game more than a year but seems like Bethesda really likes no-context flaying ragdoll animations...
What was the result? 👀
Y e e t
AND HE'S OUTTA THERE!!!
8 years, thousands of hours and 10+ play throughs and I’ve never seen this..
I beg of you, please don’t make me reinstall this. It’s 2021 already for fucks sake.
WULD - NAH - **YEET!**
I've watched this seven times and im still crying omg wtf
When you think you have seen it all in Skyrim 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ah, so u sided with the dawn guard I see

🤣🤣🤣🤣 byeeeeeeeeee
I need the repercussions of this video! Did they just continue like nothing happened?
*YEET*
YEET
If only you could do the same with such a magnitude to delphine
Bruh
😂
Lmaooo
Yeet of the decade! :D
u/savevideo
Hey, I just discovered that dragon hearts from Hunterborn have the paralysis effect too, gonna try to make paralysis poisons.
u/getvideobot
That was 😂😂😂👍
You *dick*
I have to try this!
How does your Skyrim look like this ?? 😍
😧
When you’re with the boys and she sends that “ come over “ text message.
Imagine you're teaching the first dragon born in a thousand years and instead of him being awestruck and yearning to learn from you he hits you with a numb numb boy and sends you off your own fucking cliff
At least he is essential
Yes
I can almost hear the Mario Death Scream.
Arngeir: (pulls out a crossbow himself) *NOW ITS YOUR TURN*
I'm imagining the "Goofy holler" over this.
Hahahahaha amazing!!!!!!
😂😂
Hahaa omg what happens to him after that?
I really like it with the Nordic carved armor
Where you get a crossbow 😂
Wheee
Bye Main Quest! Also bye Wulfgar  you were my favorite because of your name and your face was better than Arngier’s
Also I can’t wait to kidna— I mean invite you to my house to have some “dinner” after I kill a Wulf 
We will have some Wulf meat now and I will wear that Wulf hide as a coat to keep me warm when I listen to screaming people ummm don’t listen to me.
He said "Bye Felicia"
Anybody who doesn’t think paralysis is the best effect in the game is lying to themselves.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
"Wuld"

-Master Wulfgar, last words
Dogecoin to the moon!
There's a crossbow.
maximum yeet
"Wulfgar, awayyyyyyy!"
Hahaha
I must go, my people need me.
Sail!
lmao this was beautiful
But where does he go
This was more epic than I imagined
Holy fuck I'm in a room of people and I'm just laughing so hard at this, getting some looks
Lol never thought I would see such a thing
Ahh yes, the long forgotten thu’um, known among the dova as “yeet”
His people need him.
“It’s a bird! No, it’s a plane! NO, it’s Wolfgar!”
Did you find him slowly making his way back up the mountain? XD
HAHAHAHAHA
ITS TOO LATE FOR ME TO DO THIS
I screamed LOL god I love this game
His people need him. And he must go.
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen on Reddit today
Local Dragonborn shoots an old man in the back of the skull
This man agroed a dragon that was about to kill me and saved me from having to load a save 30 minutes before. He died while doing so. Figured I'd give him a honourable farewell he deserves.

The snowberries are a nice touch for a Nord farewell.
That’s nice, I’m playing Skyrim when I get home now
"I'm not dead yet!"
Too bad one of the somber soundtracks wasnt playing, that would have really brought the mood on
I have to admit, I was half expecting that Skyrim Physics would happen, and his body would end up getting tossed to the moon the second you did anything.
RIP you brave man, may he reach Sovngarde.
Final words:

"Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard...."
Sometime in the future

Kid : Dad, why’d you name me ‘Whiterun Guard that saved dovahkiin from a dragon’?

Dragonborn : Listen here you little shit, you wouldn’t be here if it were not for ‘Whiterun Guard that saved dovahkiin from a dragon’

Kid : But, like can’t you actually use his name?

Dragonborn : His name was whiterun guard
stuff like this is what makes this game special
"Thank you for sacrificing your life so I would not be inconvenienced for 30 minutes. You shall not be forgotten."
The whiterun guards are respectable. A good chunk of other whiterun people on the other hand...
Wait firewood actually burns???? How did I never know this
That's the best thing about Skyrim. 

Everybody pulls a knife when it's dragon'oclock
F
And you know what his cousin gets? Guard duty.
take 2 hours to prep a proper farewell for saving from a 30 minute setback…
Is it common for people to not save like every 30 seconds? I don't know a single person who saves as much as I do.
u/WhiterunGuards We lost a good man, may he meet Tsun on the whalebone bridge in Sovngarde with courage.
Lmfao... this was actually quite touching... i appreciate your kind.
u/whiterunguards Is this you? Please tell me you're safe.
This is probably one of the most touching things I’ve ever seen in a video game. Yeah they did a big thing for Kodlak Whitemane, but who ever remembers the common guardsmen?
In the end, he WAS an adventurer like you...
Only thing i can think of is how the hell you managed to drag all that stuff around. Been tryna decorate my house and placing wine bottles on shelves - tougher battle than a dragon.
Me: *see someone rping in Skyrim* 

Me: *reinstalls Skyrim with mod that makes body's turn to ash*

Me: *breaths deep* yeah baby
Sovundgard awaits brother!!
I expected a perfectly cut fus-ro-dah at the end
I got into a 3-way fight one time between a dragon and some forsworn. The Forsworn split their arrows between me and the dragon and the dragon eventually agro-d to the Forsworn. I appreciate their sacrifice, but I looted them and left their corpses to decompose anyhow.
A true hero. May talos watch over him in sovngarde

Bruh, this made me legit tear up.
Rest well sweet prince
What a nice touch. That’s how I want to go.
Oh my god, I’m not the only one who does this?
….. Fuck yeah.
That is some honorable shot right there. R. I. P guard. (insert imagery of dumping a 40oz of Black Briar mead on his smoldering corpse)
♪ ooh we drink to our youth to days come and gone, for the age of aggression is now nearly done ♫

&#x200B;

fee like they need this playing as his remains go off to sovengarde.  
Tsun will gladly welcome him into Shors hall for his valiant fight vs a dragon.
A traditional Nord burial ceremony. For a brave nord warrior. May he live forever In Sovngarde.
He was once an adventurer... just like us
Now we need a funeral pyre mod. Could be a spell which let's you turn a corpse to ashes.
His ancestors are smiling at him.
Sovenguard awaits >!hopefully he has better luck against alduin!<
Glory and honor to the fallen.
This was beautiful
As stupid as this may sound: I did not know firewood actually burned.
[R.I.P.](https://i.imgur.com/qdhorhH.jpg) Whiterun Guard. May you sit at the tables with the greats in Sovngarde.
Lo, there do I see my father.
Lo, there do I see my mother,
and my sisters, and my brothers.
Lo, there do I see the line of my people,
Back to the beginning!

Lo, they do call to me.
They bid me take my place among them,
In the halls of Sovngarde!
Where the brave may live forever!

TIL wood actually burns; awesome
His name was Robert Paulson..
Was expecting Fus Ro Dah
Would up vote this more if I could

Edit:spelling
If this wasn't PS4 I'd ressurect him and keep him as a follower to make his life a lot more exciting.
Heroes don't always were capes, or in this case weird the power of the voice...
Should have used fire breath
This is a great idea. Save the body on the wood until night time to get the glow all around for dramatic effect. During the day, have every NPC in the area drinking and partying in his honor. Tables full of food, every mug full of ale, every bard singing a song. And, every guard putting a sweetroll on his body as an offering.

Is there a way to stage something in Skyrim? I know you can make movies with Minecraft and such.
One with the force, he is now.
You killed him and staged this, didnt you. *You.. Monster.*
F
This was nice 

I sometimes give These types of funerals to Fallen comrades and worthy enemies if roleplaying wise i have time and opportunity to do so.

One thing that always gets me is that burning bodies in my modded game turns those bodies  into ashes or very charred and burned remains and a follower who died by defending you really does look disturbing when they head is just a burned flesh and bone with empty Eye sockets 👀
This is why i love the resurrect spell mod.
No, wait, wooden logs constantly burn if you set them on fire? Is it vanilla or mod?
https://youtu.be/ojEAU1Pw9S0 - relevant
Cue the John Williams Force Theme!

Sovngarde awaits this brave Nord.

That was a fitting roleplay farewell, OP.
Very honorable of you, good sir.
Damn I needed that, beautiful
Farely new to Skyrim, how did you carry him?
How did you move his body?
Thats why I downloaded the resurrection spell so I don’t have to feel guilty when I end up getting someone killed.
I’ve been playing the game for 10 years and today I learned that you can set things on fire and watch them burn in Skyrim.
F
F
Wait. Did I just learn that wood in this game is actually interactive with fire?
I was imagining the song from fast & the furious when Brian died
As fearless in death, as he was in life.
This one is worthy....QUICK trap his soul in a black gem
You should use the Dead Body Remover mod, so that the body would literally burn up and turn to ash. I use it all the time, and only today did I give Shadr a ceremonial cremation, when he died trying to help defend me from vampires just seconds after I told him he didn't owe Sapphire money anymore.
Dude kills whiterun guard for internet points. Influencers are disgusting
-Search Charred Corpse-
F
Once more into the fray...
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.
Live and die on this day...
Live and die on this day...
Take My godamn reward!
Reload the save and spare him?
What a legend. Respect.
I was expecting you to accidentally yeet him into the river with a shout
F
Thats a nice farewell you did, made me cry for him.
How did he taste?
Never to be seen again by his family, left for his guard patrol and the only thing found near by was his armor and and a pile of ashes
My character is a werewolf and I don't kill wolves at all so when they get aggressive I use animal allegiance and before I didn't have it I ran away from them. I've killed a few wolves and gave them funerals  too.
Wait, I know him... He used to be an adventurer, just like you.. I guess his old wound at the knee is not causing him pain anymore 😢
F. May he make merry and drink forever in Sovngarde.
It's a terrible day for rain
Figuring there was some BS mod waiting for OP to light the fire and the guy just gets up jumping and yelling from the fire. I was preparing to get jump scared.
Knowing skyrim, I was expecting him to get up and start attacking you when the fire started
To Valhalla for the brave worrier
How did you get him placed so perfectly on that wood?? Also how did you stack the wood like that lol
This game never ceases to amaze me. I’m absolutely terrible at it, but I love seeing what other players can do. 
F for the dragon-slayer.
Was half expecting a dragon to swoop in for some revenge at the end there. Glad they left you alone
“I’m not dead!”
First 30 seconds of this clip are entirely unnecessary.
His name was Robert, son of Paul.
Damn this reached top in r/all
Is it odd I get slightly emotional from this. Rest easy, brave hero.
like this
His name was Robert Paulson
Hail the glorious dead 🍻
I was fighting a dragon and accidentally pushed my companion so they proceeded to gang up on me with the dragon.

Aw this made me sad. Honestly a very sweet thing to do OP

“Hey man, thanks for saving me from reloading my game back to 30 minutes ago. Here’s a cremation to honor you by!”
*find your way home*
Was expecting you to fus roh da his dead body ngl
Oh man... That was beautiful
This is some deep roleplaying i love it.
Had a mod back in the day that let me do various funerals for people. Ranged from burnt corpse on a stick to something akin to Koldiak's pyre on the skyforge. Added nice touches to that same situation. Good show amigo.
So uhhh, there's a lovers lab mod out there that lets clothes catch fire and burn off.
  
it really changes the scene.
How is this #1 on r/all?
rip u/whiterunguards you fought that dragon valiantly
Viking funeral 

He will be honored in Sovengard and Valhalla
*Cue the Bill Gates “It’s amazing what people will do with computers in 30 years” meme.
He definitely earned a place in Sovngarde. Let us drink mead in his honor!
And now his watch has ended.
Leeeeeroy JJJJENKINS
Beautiful send off friend, Talos guide you, and may your path lead you too warm sands
He came to us from whiterun, he was always vigilant in his duties. Always telling stories about being an adventurer, and wanted to prove himself while his cousin was off fighting dragons.

He saved the Dragonborn by putting himself in harms way, he saved all of us. We will never see his like again,…. And now his watch has ended…
Because that's how you play Skyrim.
Hail the victorious dead!
How long has it been since this came out? And I’m still excited to see content from it.
Not going to lie, thought you were going to shout him into the river
This man dies fighting a dragon and you’re like “well, better cook him while he’s fresh” and cremate him before even notifying his family to give their farewells
This is so skyrim: carrying a torch but using fire magic instead 👌
Wait is this a mod? Or could you ignite logs this whole time and I didnt know
So does it stay lit because it’s all firewood or do you have a mod on?
The most meaningfull death. Fuck of Lydia, god damn, would you fuck off for 5 seconds!?
Have you heard about our Lord and saviour, quicksave?
How did you get the fire to burn for so long?!
Wanna believe he's that guard who complains about his cousin being out killing dragons while he's on guard duty, and he died doing what he dreamed to do
Then later, in Sovengarde... Alduin has you on the ropes, about to end the hope of Tamriel... when you hear... "Let me guess. Someone stole your sweetroll?" As he grabs Alduins tail and spins him like Mario 64, launching him into a wall, as you and him stand over the foul beast, and end the threat together.
This is the way
Did you take his ashes to the Throat of the World?
“A glowing tribute, Mr. Kidd.” Guess the James Bond reference.
And now his watch has ended….
TIL wood burns in Skyrim.
A true hunters burial. 🎶 *Carry on my wayward son, there'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest, don't you cry no more.* 🎶
This may be a stupid question but how did you get the flames to be so large for so long? Is that just vanilla Skyrim stuff that I can't remember?
Bring wood and oil
Ironically, his final words to the Dovahkiin before getting his ass torn asunder by a random flying hate-engine were:

"My cousin is out there fighting dragons and what do I get? Guard duty..."

Little did he know it was technically a wyvern by definition but, alas, ignorance is bliss and life is fleeting, oh you foolishly courageous bastard...

May you walk the noticably small Halls of Sovngarde aimlessly, commenting to the likes of Ysgramor, and other great nordic heroes, your preconcieved annoyance that some one had indeed stolen their sweet roll, for all eternity!

Harken! For surely Shor has returned to his Hall with this warrior's passing!
Its 9am and Im crying at work
And now his watch has ended.
YOU'RE HERE, THERE'S NOTHING I FEAR 
AND I KNOW THAT MY HEART WILL GO OOOOOOOOoooooonnnnn

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
*Lights the soldier on fire as a sign of respect and farewell*

"Never should have come here!"
Cosnach, the follower you get in a fist fight in Markarth was my number one follower for most of the game

I dismissed him at one point for some reason and an ancient dragon attacked Markarth. I fought with spells (it's what I was grinding at the time) and the day after the battle I got a letter of condolence saying that Cosnach was dead. I guess at some point my spellcasting hit him when he was downed fighting the dragon

I went to the hall of the dead to find his belongings (by the way that's a thing) in a grave, the giveaway being a really old set of full dwarven armor.

Took his belongings and made my own shrine for him on the corner outside the Markarth house's stairs. After each adventure thereafter, I would drop off something neat or shiny like a gemstone or a flower I picked

He was my dude

He was "my favorite drinking buddy"
That arrow he took to the knee may have taken away his adventuring but it didn't take away the massive balls he had.

RIP sweet prince.
Funfact: your post appeared in the German Internet magazine Gamestar if I am correct
Lol the fire ends and he’s still chilling like “let me guess…someone stole your sweet roll?”
Wholesome is for the Nords
Imagine he was still alive, the screams, the cackle of chaos. What a nice thought
Not all heroes wear capes. He used to be an adventurer like you, until he took a dragon to the everywhere.
Now play "Glory to the Brave - Hammerfall" and you will have a great scene.

Bet you gona cry.
Now that is how you role play.

Wind be at your back.
o7
May he dine with his ancestors in sovngarde
If this was oblivion he'd revive get up and say 
"Whoa whoa there watch the magic"
I can't have been the only one waiting for the "FUS--..."
Sovangarde awaits a man who dies a hero’s death with weapon in hand
I’ll meet you in sovngarde ,some day, my brother. For now lay in your rest, and let us rejoice in your honor whilst telling tales of your glory around the mead hall. Talos be praised!
30 minutes later. 🪵 🔥
This is nice but I know you dragging his body and throwing him against the wood over and over to get him in just the right spot was not so nice
You probably spent more than a half hour preparing his funeral. I'm not saying it wasn't worth it. But in the end he saved you no time.
That is really beautiful
I was waiting for a fus-ro-da to yeet that neatly piled pyre across that river
I guarantee Bethesda will see this and it'll be an Easter egg in the next game
Sovengrde awaits my dude🥲
Missed the opportunity to force blast him into Oblivion
tbh tho probably spent more time setting this alter up than the 30 minutes lost by loading a save =P
Ok  you, you can have my upvote.
Agroed?
Sköl, warrior! We’ll meet again in Valhalla.. Err.. Sovngarde!
Please tell me you keybinded right hand to F
He was a true nord, simple as that.
F
I was half expecting you to levitate the burning platform and set it into that water in the background like a viking funeral. Still cool tho
He will be known as the guard who took a dragon to the knee.
RIP
Bring wood and oil. No tomb for Whiterun Guard. No long, slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.
F
For some reason I keep waiting for his force ghost to pop up after he burns
F
You will meet again in Sovngarde
Are you using so type of fire mod?
Thats the most respect ive ever seen given to a guard.
a real honourable would be to scream him into the sky
i love how this could be possible made by a moder, it would be nice to give some friends a honored funeral
Wind guide him.
This is wholesome and honorable af.
But....butbutbut....!...ViDeO gAmEs PrOmOtE ViOlInS!
I absolutely thought the whole pyre was a setup, that you were gonna shout fus ro dah and launch him into the distance. Instead, it turned out wholesome. Well done OP, and RIP to your saviour.

Sovngarde awaits
Gotta ask: how long did it take you to perfectly arrange everything like that without it exploding?
This is the most immersive thing I’ve seen, goddamn
He saved you 30 minutes which you then spent giving him a proper rest. I salute you and this valiant soul
Wait, you can light firewood on fire like that?? About to test it, all these little things I'm learning about the game from this subreddit after playing for years
F
Was today years old when I found out that lighting wood on fire stays lit. I know it makes sense. Fire + wood. But never did this. Nice.
Do you have a mod that makes things burn longer?
bro he was just a heavy sleeper
Damn, you're good.

I tried to do something similar for a guard that died at the Western Watchtower dragon attack. It took me like 30 min just to get him in a proper laying position with their sword lying on their chest and their arms crossed over this hilt. 

THIS is next level.
If the Dragonborn gets paralyzed while using Whirlwind Sprint...

Got a report for: "Dumb nintendo music"

Mods can't see the usernames of who reports stuff but to that person I say: "no u"

**EDIT**: But seriously though, "no unrelated material" (Rule 3)  doesn't apply here. Background music, to an extent, doesn't have to be from Skyrim. In this post it's 100% fine. Just don't start overlaying your cousins crappy soundcloud rapping to Skyrim posts and you'll be fine. "No memes" (Rule 2) would apply though.
Skyrim; You don't really get bored, you just play weirder.
His only regret was having Boneitis.
Wait till the speed runners see this
I gave Faendal a bow with paralysis poison applied to it and provoked him into attacking me. Paralysis also negates fall damage.

Lol that pose... you look like you're going to propose someone. That's just a cool way to impress your bae, good job!
Imagine you just woke up. You got out of bed, said hello to your mother and ate breakfast. You hear your friends call your name from the window, calling you to play with them, but your mother tells you to take the dog for a walk first. You sigh, call the dog and let him out, following wherever he goes. All of a sudden you see a strange shadow on the ground. It looks... Like a man. You look up to see a man wearing dragon bones as clothing, falling from the sky in a running position. He's coming right at you. You panic. You start to try to guess where he will land to try to save yourself, for he is long gone. He's getting closer and closer until eventually, he falls to the ground, centimeters away from you. You get closer to him, trying to examine what you imagine is a completely mangled and destroyed body. But he stands up, doesn't even glances at you and runs away. You are confused.

But a flesh wound
Ultra Immersive players who turned off fast travel: "Improvise, adapt, overcome"
Cast flame cloak next time
Kinda cool how it reveals a tiny bit of logic of the game code, if we make some assumptions.

Essentially the paralysis tells the hit character to lose control but maintain any current momentum. 

And that means that the whirlwind sprint is a combination of two separate commands, one that sets the players velocity to a certain amount (or it's possible that it simply takes the total distance required and does some calculations to determine how fast it needs to go to get to that location after a certain amount of time), and then once the player has gotten to their destination it stops them.

It's important to note then that the slow down action is still considered an active command, or else the paralysis wouldn't be able to stop it; just like how the player hitting something with their body still works since it's an outside force.

Neat.
Like Spartan armor lock
Any landing you can walk away from..
Amazing
Imagine living in that village just one day a paralyzed guy comes down from the mountain, gets up and goes like nothing is wrong.
Manual fast travel
With this and the original where he Paralyzes Wulfgar during the whirlwind sprint training, we should really get a compilation and more footage of the effects of paralyze during different actions.
This new fast travel system seems overly complicated.
Everytime you fast travel you just ask a random person to do this.
“Hey, Ron.”

“Hey, Billy.”
That's amazing
Almost took out my boy Stump 🥺
In all seriousness, epic clip
Imagine being that boy
Did Faendal follow you down and apologize?
"Well, i better get the fuck outta here" - Paarthurnax
I like how we progressed from shooting one of the gray beards off the side of a mountain with a paralysis potion and whirlwind sprint to doing it ourselves. 

this is why I love Skyrim communities we always progress things to insanely stupid levels. Give it time and someone will find a way to progress it to the next level.  

The new way of getting down mountains LOL paralyzed whirlwind

I thought cabbage trick shots were cool, now I see a Dragonborn trick shot off the top of the Throat of the world into Riverwood under a dog. Just simply marvelous
Ahh Newton's first law.
Lock your armor Spartan, it's gonna be a rough landing!
"Mom, Dads Home"
Lock your armor, Spartan, it's gonna be a long drop!
Remember the armor lock ability in Halo (I dont recall which one)?  This reminds me of that.
I 100% expected a ragdoll death just plopping down after getting up.
Tis but a scratch!
That’s one way to travel
New fast-travel mode unlocked.

NPC dude be like,  Hmmm, looks like rain...  the *FUCK*?!?
Lucky you didn't land on the chicken, or you would of really been in trouble.
The people in town must’ve been like “There goes that damn Dragonborn again.”
Dude people keep stealing this sorry bro
Damn.  I thought Western Airlines was the “only way to fly”.  What a great way to relocate.
paralysis is the best part of this game
I like how the dog barks at him
This is why Skyrim is the best game ever.
Mama mia
Nice.
Are you using some graphic mod?
(I always played the ps3 version maybe you are using just the remastered version)
Tis only a mere scratch.
This is just the Yeet shout
This. Is. The. Best. Congrats, you have truly beaten skyrim

Jesus, he became a human swastika...
What game is the music from? Mario 64?
For a brick, he flew pretty good!
How did he not die from that?
A dragon!  I saw a dragon!
I'm surprised the game engine even handles this lol.
NEW RECORD
BAW! GAWD! HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!
Did paralyze just negate the fall damage you lucky bastard?
Ah, finally. A way to fus-ro-dah MYSELF off of the mountain
Thats what happens during the loading screen when you fast travel
Something something cloud district
And the town below is full rendered and ready to play. God I love Skyrim!
This is beautiful. I never knew paralysis negated fall damage. Just goes... yeeeeeeeet! Right off the top lol
Have you ever travelled to the cloud district?  Yes, I guess you have.
On the plus side he stuck the landing.
Ahh yes, this takes me back to Mario 64 where child me would heartlessly throw the penguins off the snowy cliffs.
This has made my day so much brighter ☀️
The kid and dog are just like “yeah, I’ve seen this shit before” lmao
Edit: looks like Riverwood, so Stump and… I forget the girls name. Alvor’s daughter! :p
The only thing this needs is a guard saying, “Damn dragon could come swooping down at any time!”

You mean Dragonborn?
Anyone who says bugs ruin the experience is wrong.  Some of the most entertaining moments I've had in gaming have been because of bugs.
Tis but a scratch
Quicker than fast travel
It’s a good job you were wearing a helmet after landing directly on your head like that
This is modern art
OMG AND THEN HE GETS UP
Now do it in VR. Lol
This is Ground Control to Major Tom!!
I love how if you fall in any part of that region you always end up in riverwood LOL
On top of the moutain:

"I thought para-gliders were wings. Is this what he meant?"
Now you can go right next door and get some mead
*wii sports voice* Nice Shot!
If you jump off a cliff and just before you hit the ground eat netch jelly  You will be imune to the fall damage until the paralysis wears off
I had no idea paralysis could function like armor lock in halo. That's freaking rad mayn
And you got back up?! Well done.
Hi, I'm the dragonborn, and this is jack ass
Well, that's Fast Travelling.
Imagine you live in this town, going about your business when THE GOD WARRIOR WHO WENT TO HEAVEN AND KILLED THE KING OF DRAGONS TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE COMES SOARING DOWN FROM THE SKY DOING A STUPID POSE, HITS THE GROUND, AND GETS BACK UP NOT SHOWING EVEN A SCRATCH. THEN HE BUYS CHEESE.
The Mario music really makes the clip
"Look at Randy Orton slithering in"
"WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT!!!"
incoming top post of all time
the music really tops it off lmao
[deleted]
A classic
Fast travel
Not paralyzed, he just had armor lock
Talk about fast travel
Let this be a lesson to those with paralysis: don’t try parkour.
Tis but a scratch
Watching the Dragonborn fall off the side of a mountain never gets old. Thanks for the video!
That was a terrific spill! That’s quite a raspberry!
Lmao the music fits so well
“This is fine.”

   Walks away
Haha this had me chuckling
Fast travel! Quick!
This is what NPCs see when you fast travel
Running form on point
All I can hear after seeing this is Lego Jango Fetts death noise
Gets up like nothing happened*
This reminds of that scene in Black Sheep where Chris Farley falls down the mountain.
I was listening to Hooked on a feeling and it really fit this video well
Upvoted for the dog and music. The video was cool too.
wheeeeee
The scariest thing is we’re the fucking Dragonborn
I WAS SCREAMING HE ALMOST LANDED IT. JUDGES ARE GONNA BE IMPRESSED WITH THAT ONE RODJER
That was a thing of beauty
How’d you survive? (Nvm I saw your comment)
I so want somebody to make a "Shooting Stars" meme out of this.
Lmao almost took out the dog
Took a mountain to the knee and got up fine.
You hit a dog, I guess this means John Wick comes after you now.
I'm speed
......Dumb ways to die....so many dumb ways to die.....dumb ways to di-i-ie so many dumb ways to diie
This is glorious.
I guess that's one  way to get around
HELLO SI.................R
All roads lead to riverwood
"Tis but a scratch!"
"Tarhiel, huh? Wonder what his scroll does"
Sweet Jesus you even landed in Riverwood
*Waaaaaaaahhhhhh*

**UHHH**
Barry the Chopper.
Can someone turn this clip into that space flying meme from last year?
That rock is a looot higher than I remembered
now this is podracing
I like how you see the arrow in the thigh then after one flip its gone...
Just like how the old skooma would hit ya. Now those were the days of distilling I tell ya.
Talk about projectile motion 😅
That music... Why does make me want to throw a penguin over a ledge?
"This isn't flying, this is falling with style."
"you're probably wondering how I ended up here"
And the Dragonborn is still standing!
IN THE AAAARRRRMS OF AN ANGEL FLY AWAAAAAAAAY
That's what happens to Spartans when they use armor lock
Wouldn't this have been simpler with netch jelly?
Leaked video of frodo's real travel method back from mount doom
Definitely a more fun way to fast travel!
That was already absolutely amazing even before you landed in riverwood
What Skyrim Music is this?
YAAAAAAAAAAA HOO HOO HOO HOOEY
“You seem new around here so I’ll go easy, but don’t get on my bad side”
Tis but a scratch
Imagine being that kid
I love how the little girl and dog are just... not phased at all by a man in dragon bone armor falling out of the sky right in front of them.
The end is like a flying elbow drop!
People in Riverwood are probably like:  
"Where the f\*ck did you come from?!"
They fact that you can just fly half way across the map into a town fully loaded with npcs just walking around is amazing to me
When you're over cumbered and need to fast travel
I see the physics are spot on as usual!
This game truly is a masterpiece.Think I’m gonna cry
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath!
IRL this would be exploited for fast travel.
Well that's one way to Fast Travel to Riverwood!
I had a moment once where I paralysed a bear and then unrelenting forced it in a valley near solitude. 

It ping ponged around the map for ages.
That little girl has seen some shit
Try to do something similar but get hit by ice form Shout
What’s with the Mario music? Am I out of the loop on this?
WULLLDD NA ~*nyeh*

That comedic timing makes this so much better with sound.
All hail the Dab-onborn.
Walk it off
It’s like when you have a Bouncy ball and throw it
BASE dabbing
His armor is locked up. Looks like the gel layer took most of the impact.
tis but a scratch *gets back up*
I used to be an adventurer like you until I got paralyzed while sprinting and yeeted myself off a mountain.
Punted
My man just went from the throat of the world down to Riverwood.. Faendal is gonna have a hell of a hike to catch up to you
What the loading screen doesn't show you when you fast travel.
Ive seen this video at least 4 times this week, come on
You’ve been hit by, you’ve been struck by, Tah Kest!
the ULTIMATE gainer
Paralysis negates fall damage?
Shot back to the beginning of the game.
He pulled a Leia
Now this is what I call fast travel
WULD NAH YEET
Don’t mind me even though I came flying from the sky
Credit to the guy who showed everyone this trick with the Greybeards.
So THATS how fast travel works.
Finally a solution to when enemies are nearby
Skyrim survival mode speedrun trick? 🤔
Ah yes, the fabled rigor mortis arrow, nice nice.
We're going down!!! Lock your armor Spartan!!!
‘Let’s-a-go’ -Paarthunax
You should see what happens when you get one of the greybeards to ice you to breath
Shooting Stars version when?
random npcs walking by

oh what happened

what a shame
“Tis but a scratch”
Did it take only 20 years for this experiment to come to fruition, or ...
Owie! 😭
When you're well over your carry weight but you don't want to drop any loot
It's like they had the Armor Lock from Halo 😂
Sick 900 at the end
Ah! Dead body!
God, I love skyrim's janky physics
*insert shooting star music*
Dab-onborn
Now that is a super hero landing!
that's one way to get off a mountain
bark bark
So thats how masterchief arrived to earth without harm
It’s actually just armour lock
is that a golden dragon??
Hey, you. You're finally awake
And he just gets up like if it was nothing. 

“‘Tis but a flesh wound”
u/savevideo
Annnnnnnnddddd it's gooood! The dragons have just won the super bowllll!!
ya got a great view of the world
"Ouch, that hurt!"
Soooo if you fall down a cliff and drink paralysis potion at the last moment do you negate fall dmg?
"Hey Mom! The Dragonborn is here!"
u/savevideo
For some reason country roads played in my head as he yeeted off the cliff.
Ma! Dragonborn are falling from the sky again!
He got hit so hard he made it to riverwood
I was expecting him to instantly drop dead after he came out of ragdoll
Parkor
\[Internal Screaming\]
Superior fast travel method discovered. Alert the speed runners.
NOT DEAD HAHAHA
Que Obi-Wan saying “another happy landing”
Hey wait a minute, I've seen this one. Outside Seyda Neen, nice spells better hat.
TEBOW
Girl walks away like people fall out of the sky all the time.
Fast travel
That’s what happens when you’re bad!!
You must be on Special Edition otherwise vanilla Skyrim probably would've crashed having to load Falkreath that fast
"Do a backflip!"
Wait and this is better than cyberpunk?
Loving the new fast travel system!
I love this game
I really wanted him to land upright
This is begging to be edited into that spinning through space meme... Whatever it's called.
I’m the Dragonborn and I’m the fastest man alive.
"Gotta go fast!"
It’s a long walk back from Riverwood...
Stump: "Yo what."
I'm ok!
Tis but a scratch
I’d recognize Kakariko Village anywhere
Ain’t everyday we get visitors to Riverwood
That's one way to fast travel.
Sent his ass back to Riverwood. Lmao 😆
"Tis just a scratch"
Back where it all started, home sweet riverwood.
That’s one way to fast travel
Welcome to Helgen
Ah yes, fast travel
«Gotta go, the town of Riverwood needs me!» - The Dragonborn, probably.
This reminds me of Kars from Dio getting sent off into space with his weird pose
In my last playthrough I used console commands to make a hood enchanted with self paralysis. Descending mountains have never been so fun.
Fast travel with a view
This kills the dragonborn.
Was the music the song from TLOZ Ocarina of Time when your picking up the cuukoos? If so brilliant choice of music.
Slow, styled out backflips are so clean.
Damn, it's quicker than fast travelling to riverwood.
I'm not well versed in the mechanics of skyrim, but could it be possible to use a paralysis potion on yourself as the during the startup of whirlwind sprint?
Gotta love the mario galaxy music aswell
See, just go extremely rigid when you're falling and you'll be 100% fine!
I see Skyrim's air travel program is getting along nicely. You even survived!
So this is what the Assassins call a "leap of faith"...
"A dude could jump off a mountain and not hurt himself, 'cause he did brace himself, and knew something about the levels of gravitivity and polarity."
I can't be the only one who started humming the shooting star meme song
“Chance to paralyze the target for 3 seconds”

*25 seconds later*
Fast Travel: BTS.
# Well, great nap!
Is that the music from Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the tree house level?
Music is perfect.
Nintendo DMCA incoming
'I lived bitch'
Discovered: Riverwood
Beware, beware, the Dragonborn dabs.
Nice landing right in front of a boy and his dog
The coach of fast travel
Imagine having your eyes open and not being to do a fucking thing as you descend
What gets me was thing he get back on his feet and didnt die :D
Gotta go Fus!
Gotta Go Fast
That is a good way to be immune to fall damage
good as new
The Dragonborn is going to be a great card to trade for some dragons.
Must've been the wind
"Hey, you remember when that guy came through with Alvor's Nephew a few weeks ago? Yeah, that guy. His kid said he came outta fuckin' NOWHERE, crashed went straight through her dog busting 3 of its ribs, and then just laid on the ground like he was FROZEN! Scared the ever loving hell outta the girl!

I think it's time to move to Whiterun."
Dragon language motherfucker, do you speak it?

A NEW MOTHERFUCKA TOUCHES THE BEACON
I have had it with all these mother fuckin draugrs in this mother fuckin dungeon!
I recognize Delphine has made a decision to kill Paarthurnax, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.
This is a tasty sweet roll!
-What hold you from?

-What?

-'What' ain't no hold I ever heard of, do they speak Dovahzul in 'What'?
What does Hermaeus Mora look like?
Check out the big brain on Nazeem!
God damn OP, this is some serious gourmet shit!
The path of the Dragonborn is beset on all sides by the inequities of the Elves and the tyranny of evil Imperials. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the Province of Skyrim for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of Redguard women. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious shouts those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Dragonborn when I lay my Ebony War Axe (Legendary) upon thee!!
DEEP BLUE SEA!? THAT WAS A  GOOD ONE! A FUCKIN SHARK ATE ME
They speak Dovah on Nirn?
*jumps off a mountain cliff and survives 100ft*

“We should be fucking dead, man!”
“Say ‘do you get to the cloud ruler district often’ one more time, i dare you i double dog dare you!!!!”
Shit I eat everythang. I eat the pheasant roast, I eat the braided bread, I eat every motherfuckin’ thang.
F-F-Fus?!
Dovahzul* motherfucker, do you shout* it?
Royale with skever.
*Holds up a Dragonbone Greatsword*

“When you absolutely, positively have to kill every mother fucka in the room, except no substitutes”
Nazeem: do you get to the-

Samuel L.: I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing!
Best fucking meme I've ever seen
You know what they call gold coins in Skyrim?
Has a samuel l jackson sound mod been made for skyrim, if not why the hell not.
You know what they call a charred skeever meat and eidar cheese sandwich in Skyrim?  



A Jarl with cheese.
"What" ain't no district I ever heard of!!
'eats 40 wheels of cheese' This Is Some Serious Gourmet Shit.
Is that supposed to be Samuel L Jackson?

Edit: These replies are confusing me even more.

Edit 2: I finally know know who he is supposed to be. He's that guy with ice powers, a eye patch, super suit, afro, always says "mothafucka", purple lifghtsaber, and a member of the Jedi council. He's black Jesus.
The path of the Dragonborn is beset on all sides by the inequities of the merchants and the tyranny of Daedra. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, slaughters the Draugr in Bleak Falls Barrow, for he is truly Lucan's keeper and the adopter of orphaned children.
I was not expecting /r/skyrim to make the first 10 posts on /r/all.  Congrats, OP.
Shit Dovah, thats all you had to say
*That scene from Pulp Fiction except instead of Ezekiel 25:17 it's Heimskr's whole Talos sermon*

After reading these comments I am going to need a Samuel L. Jackson mod that turns like half of the in-game quotes to his quotes.

EDIT: better yet, I'm gonna need his quotes as dragon shouts.
"Do you know what they call sweet rolls in Valenwood?"

"Royale with cream"
Dahhhhh I speak!

God bless you, OP, for providing the opportunity for all these glorious TES/Pulp fiction jokes.
This is the best thread I've read for a while
Wha wha what!?
Sliders?
Take my upvote!
But... there is one they fear. In their tongue he is Monahkriian, Motherfucker!

Fus Ro Dah!
There is actually a Dragonish skill in Daggerfall. As with most language skills in that game though, it is what appears to be interesting but is ultimately pretty useless.
FUS- RO-DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITCH?
You know what they call a sweetroll in Morrowind? A royal with cream.
Hahaha
The sliders, man! Give us the damn sliders!
"So you think a foot massage is a reason to FUS someone off of the 10,000 steps?"
Did you see a sign out front that said dead redguard storage?
Honestly I'm surprised that it's taking me to 2020 to see someone do this
Oh these are from that Nordic sweet roll joint?
Oh right. I was thinking about when I used to be an adventurer until i took an arrow in the knee.
My guy looks similar to that
It was supposed to be kevin hart
such arrogance. the thuum isn't for mere mortal redguards
Lmao i wish I had more than an upvote for this.

CURVED MOTHERFUCKIN SWORDS.
Damn. I just started a new save after seeing Skyrim available for free and wish I had seen this first. Would've loved to make my character look like SLJ.
Need a mod to make people speak like this
YOOOOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Describe what alduin look like."
I’m gonna need a character preset
YES HE DESERVES TO DIE, AND I HOPE HE BURNS IN HELGEN!
Hold onto your sweet rolls.
I upvoted this but somehow you still have 0....hmmm...

[deleted]
I have never played this game and I still LOLd
He doesn't even remotely look like SLJ.

How do you make a character who gives off such motherfuckerly energy?
Geh, Zu'u Dreh. Hi?
Badass lol
RIP Christopher Plummer. The voice actor of Arngeir.

We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother.
"Sky above. Voice within."
 "We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice. You stand in High Hrothgar, on the  slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain. Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer  selves."  -Arngeir
He taught me the voice😢
Blossom of snow, May you bloom and grow, Bloom and grow forever...
Wow. What a true legend. Thank you for almost 10 years of epic shout training.
I'm in the middle of my first playthrough in years, I'm heading back to High Hrothgar tonight to spend a bit of time talking to Arngeir I think. RIP.
 R.I.P May Talos welcome you to Soverngard The Hall of Valor. 

"In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain." \~Arngeir
I just heard this news this morning, and I'm genuinely sad about it.  Many people don't know how prolific Christopher Plummer actually was as an actor.  He played so many roles in movies, TV, games, and on stage over his lifetime.  Some of his more recent films were The Insider, A Beautiful Mind, Beginners, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and as recently as 2019 with the movie Knives Out (which is a hilariously awesome film -- it's like an Agatha Christie murder mystery turned inside-out and upside-down).  

I've been fortunate enough to see him on the stage several times as well, at the Stratford Theatre in Ontario, Canada, and he was a magnificent stage actor.  I've seen him play as Caesar in *Caesar and Cleopatra*, as Prospero in *The Tempest*, and best of all, as Lear in *King Lear.* 

By the Divines, he was amazing as Lear!  It's a Shakespeare play, and he actually played the role as if the main character (who's a king, but also an old man) was in decline with Alzheimer's.  I worked in health care for awhile and I've cared for people with Alzheimer's, and my grandfather had dementia before his death, so I'm aware of the stages, and I could literally track each stage his Lear was going through.  I've also studied the play and seen it many times, but none of those other performances came anywhere close to Plummer's.

I'm truly sad that I'll never see him take over a stage and own a character in that way again.  But the man was 91 years old, and he lived a wonderful life, so he deserves his feast in Sovngarde.  I have a feeling he's the kind of man who would probably appreciate it.   RIP, my fellow Canadian.  You were a legend.  :)
“Sky guard you”
We have felt the whisper of a word....
I saw this on the news but didn’t realize he was on Skyrim.
I found out about this today. I can’t believe I didn’t know. RIP.
"True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions. In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance."

RIP to a true legend
And Captain Vonn Trapp!
Wind guide you
It’s sad to see my voice teacher pass away may you R.I.P you did well teaching millions of Dovahkiins’s the way of the voice
“We can show you the way, but not the destination”
First Esbern and then Arngeir. Both within a year. 

RIP
He’s in Sovngarde now. May we meet again one day.
Found out he was also the Voice of Charlez Muntz from the movie Up.

Take a look at his filmography the man with a list like that it'd be odd to not have seen any of his works.
What a legacy. 
When we replay Skyrim, it won’t be the same. We’ll be listening to a ghost.
I only started playing Skyrim last year. However, as a major lover of musicals, I recognized Christopher Plummer’s voice immediately.

Just fired up the game. I’m going to run the steps, with my favorite dagger out, and leave some white flowers in the chest in honor of Plummer. 🖤
RIP Arngeir Plummer.
Dang, I loved that guy's voice in everything he did!
Definitely making a pilgrimage to high hrothgar to pay my respects
Nok, lok-zeymah. Ven aak hi. Siiv drem ahst Sovngarde. 

Sky above, Voice within.
And he was excellent as General Chang.
may he rest eternally in the plains of sovngarde in drem
He taught most of us The Way of The Voice, rest in Sovngarde brother
Arngeir has passed into Sovngarde. May he find joy drinking mead with Jurgen Windcaller in the Hall of Valor.
Wind, guide you Plummer.

From now on, I will not kill Paarthurnax.
Sovngarde awaits for a hero
Holy shit, I had no idea it was Christopher Plummer who voiced Arngeir. 

RIP.
the throat of the world is in mourning. We lost a teacher but his learning will never be forgotten
Like the Greybeards, I am now speechless.
RIP Sir.. <3
To The Hall of Valor
I've just restarted a new playthrough this week for the first time in years. Arngeir taught me the Way of the Voice today. RIP.
After all these years of hearing his grunts as i leveled up my sneak he will be greatly missed. RIP legend
I have listened to this guy talk god knows how many hours through who knows how many playthroughs and had no idea it was him. What a legend.
Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.

Long in sorrow has waited the Stormcrown, with no worthy head to rest on.

May you be ready for whatever lies ahead.
may his thu’um echo throughout sovngarde
Parthanax has lost a friend.
May he feast next to Shor in Sovngarde. RIP
He's with alduin now ❤️
Both him and Max Von Sydow who played Eastern 😔 it might sound silly but I really only knew who they were once the game was announced, I think I must've been 12 or 13. After that I started to care a lot for them and have grown to adore their body of work as I've gotten more and more into film. 

Both of their voices were so impactful for the characters they portrayed. Esbern's dream will forever stay with me
Talos guide you Chris Plummer
Sovngarde awaits... ❤️❤️❤️
Brian Jacques, Tom Clancy, Christopher Lee, Rick May, Kumiko Okae, Sean Connery, Christopher Plummer.... goodness, we're getting old....
Wind guide you.
Rest in Sovngarde legend :(
Obi Wan Sky-robey
May we meet again in sovngarde, brother.
"We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny." - You taught us how to use our voice to offer prayer to the Divine but now we hope that through your teaching that you have reached the most happy and best afterlife for someone of your heart. 😔
Rest in peace may Talos be with you sir
Sky above, voice within..
Sad news
I forgot he was Arngeir!  May he Rest In Peace in the great hall of Sovngarde with a mug of mead for all eternity!
"Let the winds guide you."
Holy shit, he taught me so much.  Skyrim was my childhood, it was the first thing that bonded me and my older brother.  It’s a fucking terrible we had to lose him, been playing this game for so many years and no matter how many mods I have he’s still my favourite character.
FUS
It's fine, now he can be with Kyne, RIP
Damn I just spoke with Arngeir yesterday. From now on I will farm sneak on Borri or Wulfgar I guess. RIP
Shit, Christopher Plummer died? Also... Christopher Plummer was in Skyrim?? Time to go through his imdb to see what else I didn't know he was in.
He’s guaranteed a place in the hall of valor in Soverngarde.
Sky above, voice within.
See you in sovngarde brother
Omg! That's amazing THAT is the voice! Holy cow... He most certainly left a beautiful mark on my world
“Sky above, Voice within.” Rest In Peace Christopher Plummer.
I remember days when the Thu'um of the Greybeards startled me as a young lad in Whiterun. Now the coming days may be quiet but the Thu'um shall live on lest it fall on deaf ears.
Just when you think the year’s reached peak shittiness it keeps getting lower.
RIP - one of my all time favourite actors.  Always loved introducing people to his work.  Watch Michael Mann's The Insider for peak Plummer.
I would just like to thank him for the years of training in shouts
Aw shoot this is how I find out about his death. Rip Arngier may you soar above the clouds of High Hrothgar into Soverngard.
Su’um ahrk morah.
Phenomenal actor.  Great run.  Rest In Peace.
Wait wait what. No
F
I'm going to play skyrim vr and visit him
I usually skip his dialogues because I've heard them a thousand times now. But I don't think I will anymore, I'd feel bad =x
Wow! I also didn’t realize this was him. So crazy. Also a lesser know part played by him was as the key antagonist, a Klingon commander in Star Trek VI the undiscovered country.
Now we stand, here on top of the world. Laying to rest one of the greatest of our time, a man with a voice that forever echos through the world and shor’s hall.  Sleep now at High Hrothgar our friend and know your work will live on.
This makes me so sad. Thanks for being part of my childhood, Christopher. Rest In Peace! ❤️
Await me in Sovngarde, brother.
This is sad, RIP Christopher. Like many of said here, I’ve spent many an hour listening to this guy.
Rest in peace. Thank you for the memories and the Voice
Thanks to mods, I always leave him as the new Arch Mage of Winterhold.
On his way to Sovngarde to square up with Esbern and settle things like true Nords.
Protector of mario
This is a good tine to sing [this song](https://youtu.be/0FLQ4rACE-0) IMO. It's an oddly fitting song. RIP to him and may we see him in Sovngarde.
Also the Von trapp father
Made me sad, made me frown
RIP thanks for the memories
Now, Dovahkin, let us have a taste of that sexy voice!
Voice definitely matches the face.
I had a conversation with Arngeir a little while ago. My umpteenth playthrough. I had now idea until now. RIP
Damn. And less than a year after we lost Max von Sydow (Esbern).
Dang..i just met him for the first time yesterday(in game)
Had to Google if this was true since I didn't see this on any other subreddits yet. Rest in peace
Wow, he did a ton of great voiceover work, looking at IMDB.  Great talent.
Looks like they modeled arngeir after him as well
Oh no. I always thought he did an amazing job of emoting some pretty far-out dialogue in Skyrim.
His legacy...changes lives.
Immortalized in one of the best video games ever made... pretty cool if think about it
General Chang: To be, or not to be....
May songs of your wisdom be sung in the mead halls of sovngaurd
He forgot to drink his potion of regeneration
Sky Guard You, Christopher. His rendition of Edelweiss in The Sound of Music always moved me.
"You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you." 

RIP Christopher Plummer may Shor accept you into his hallowed halls
Damn...

We lost Arngeir *and* Esbern?! Nirn sucks now.
*the song "Mad World" intensifies*
I never got to apologize for killing paarthurnax. Look, I promise In my 70 later ones I fixed my mistake.
May he find the warm welcome of his ancestors in Sovnegarde.
A voice i'll never be able to unhear. Rest in peace, thank you for teaching us the way of the voice.
A legendary man leaves behind a legendary legacy.
Rest in piece, you brought a smile to thousands of faces😔
Wow this is so upsetting. This game was such a big part of my childhood. RIP :(
RIP Mr Plummer and thank you.
That's sad..
Fus Ro Gone.....  god speed.  We’ll miss you, good sir.
Rest in sovngarde
Sky above, voice within..
Rest in peace
Damn. Rest In Peace Christopher ❤️
Aw what really? Damm
Is he the pic on the right or the left?
R.I.P Stay within the way of the voice.
Umm excuse me...Captain Von Trapp
Is he the “there are always people like you” guy from the first avengers?
Oh dear, I didn't know that face was Christopher's.  He has many many prominent roles
That's strange, because when I saw he'd died I thought he looks like Max Von Sydow, who is also in skyrim.
We just lost a legend. RIP
i didnt know that. He was such a legend
RIP. I will remember his teachings
Was confused about use of "toe" here.
I had no idea he was in my favorite game. And a legendary character at that!
And now I care about this guys death....
Wind guide him
What really?
That’s sad
The voice of? I did not know that. :-(
Wasn’t he also Esbern?
Rest in Peace.
He was a brilliant actor. RIP Mr Plummer, you will be missed. 😥
I never knew that!! Thanks kind stranger!
This sucks. I feel bad for raising my sneak skill now. RIP, my thoughts go out to his family. Sovngarde awaits old friend.
Rest in piece you great man
Dang... RIP he will live on forever in the game
I'm heading to high hrothgar for awhile
May he Rest In Peace knowing how much we all appreciate his contributions to the elder scrolls franchise
He looks exactly like I would imagine him in real life. RIP.
From both my favourite movie and game
WHAT CAPTAIN VON TRAPP IS AEGIR ALL THIS TIME. WTF some one make Aegir sing Edelweiss
RIP to a true OG with great voice acting skills
His voice will live on in the PS8 version of Skyrim.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
“The death of Plummermax is beyond my power to forgive.”
[removed]
I think I will stop shouting him from the mountain
these comments are making me ugly cry stop
Best Klingon ever.
May he rest in sovengarde
damn. the memories. i remember the xbox 360 years when my brother let me play skyrim, i had a blast and still play today R.I.P Dude. Hope your doing good up there. thanks for the countless years of memories.
When I was a young boy in the time of VHS my favourite film was Escape to Victory strarring  Max von Sydow and my sister's The Sound of Music starring Christopher Plummer. This caused some fights during the summer holidays. Both have left us in the last year. RIP gentlemen.
RIP

Loved him in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
He will be missed
I feel bad for ghosting him for so long
Always was a nice voice
NOOOOOO
goddamn so thats why arngeir sounded familiar
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
*Long live the Voice and the legend*
F
His soul is now with wuutharth and one eyed olaf
damn man...that sucks..
Damn, day just keeps getting worse
Holy shit I’ve played this game a million times and never made that connection
*cries*
Rest in Peace Master! 🙏 May the world be light for you!
F
Arngeir even looks like him. RIP, what an iconic voice.
Oh shit, I did not know this
What happened to him?
I knew him from Waterloo.Now I am suprised and sad because I learned this trivia in that way.
Born in the same year than Max von Sydow (Esbern, and, well, equally huge career) and died within a year of his death.
The Talos scream at the end gets me lmao
F
F
So now the voice actors for both Esbern and Arngeir have died? Wow.
RIP
RIP, you will be missed... but never forgotten.
Damn he was the main Greybeard? 😭 I'm playing right now smh r.i.p.
“Sovngarde awaits.”
Woah what. Not to be rude or anything, rip. But I swear I saw an article saying he died last year or something...thats wild
 Shor bless you
Ah I didn’t know this. The only memorable movie I saw with Mr. Plummer in it was the Sound of Music. I can’t watch the scene where he sings Edelweiss to the crowd with shedding a manly tear. 
General Tullius however I immediately recognized as my favorite XO Saul Tigh, and that’s why I always side with the Imperials. I can’t kill my 2nd favorite Galactica character.
This was a sad thing to hear :(
Rest in peace, Christopher Plummer. He was an amazing actor.
He made me choose Paarthurnax to live. 

Now, that dragon and I were pals.
That's my guy nepos the nose.
I did not know that!
Nooo dude I was just speaking to him the last time I played the other night! I am grateful to listen to his voice while he was still sharing this world with me rip to such a moving man.
Rest in Peace, we will meet again in Sovngarde, old friend
F

May he drink mead among the great heroes of Sovngarde
Brilliant job bringing the Greybeards to life. He was literally their voice as the others refuse to talk. 

RIP.
Legend! RIP!
F
Rip
He's in Sovngarde now :(
Rest in peace
he also tried to frame Captain Kirk for killing Chancellor Gorkon  edit: before anyone flips out on me that's my way of saying he was in Star Trek VI
F
Another legendary soul to walk the whale-bone bridge and take his rightful seat in the Hall of Valor.
F
RIP :(
He was Arngeir? Wow.
Talos guide you in your trip to sovngarde brother.
I can almost hear Sovngarde BGM playing now
First Esbern now Angier, who's next parthurnax
Lok Bo, Thuum tuum.
I never got to apologize for abusing him to level up my one and two handed skills in stealth😞
Thank you for teaching me how to master my gift. I will always follow your wisdom and will slay Delphine every playthrough in your honor.
May the wind guide his soul.
Damn? Was it from natural causes?
Press F to pay respects!
That’s so upsetting.
This man made my childhood, how many times I have done this quest :(
I was just watching The Sound of Music last weekend and wondered what Julie Andrews's counterpart was doing these days. I think I must have jinxed him.
I was only looking at the voices behind Skyrim videos yesterday! 😱
your shouts made my axe lighter. heil!
May wind guide you
noo dam
NOOOOOOO
Pictures you can hear.
What the fuck?  
Yesterday it was Zenimax's CEO, and now this? Who's next, Todd Howard?
Hes literally the same dude
Oh damn I just know him from the sound of music, didn't know he did the voice for arngeir too.
Wind guide you...
R.I.P
Till we meet again, in sovngarde
He will live on in the greatest game of all time.
RIP general chang
First the lady who voiced Treetrunks in Adventure Time passes, then the guy who made Dragon Tales or whatever that PBS show was, and now this? What a shitty month
I really whant to have an easter egg of him in the elder scroll 6
RIP
Damn. I was literally just watching a video about his performance in Skyrim. Sad, man. RIP.
I am officially never siding with the Blades again.
May the All-Maker bless ye
Come gather 'round all ye bastards, and raise up a cup to this arse-turd. He came and freed the fires of hell and let 'em run loose over hill and dell.
Heres to Arngeir and his knob of head, heres to the dragon the smoke and the dead. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking but he's got the fame.

We tortured some townsfolk it's true. And pounded but couldn't break through. With all his might a dragon took flight and burned the town down to a ball-bag of shite. Heres to Arngeir and his scab of a brain, heres to the dragon and all it has slain. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking but he's got the fame.

Heres to Arngeir and a pullin-me-plum, heres to the beast and the rest of you scum. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking though he's got the fame.

Skål
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
Bless him
Oh... I hope he had a happy life
May the wind guide you, and the sky guard you.
sky above, voice within.
His greatest achievement ❤️
❤️ wish you the best. May Sovngarde treat you well.
We’ll miss you master ♥️
R u fucking kiddingme! Just yesterday i was finishing my quest of the full fusrodah! Omg nooo ☹️☹️☹️
Krosis
Literally best voice work for the game outside paarthunax and the rest of the dragons. The game itself was magical but I saw sooo much passion go into those first few missions, climbing up the 7,000 steps, speaking and training with the Graybeards, and finally meeting Paarthunax. What a magical experience. Rest In Peace, you wonderful man.
Talking to the grey beards has always been a favorite little tidbit of the game for me, thank you Christopher for enriching our lives with your part in our beloved game. He's drinking exceptional mead in Sovngarde now, rest easy old timer.
You know, I don't think I've ever seen Arngeir on lists of Most Annoying/Stupidest NPCs in Skyrim. Props to you, Christopher Plummer!
I'll be waiting for you in sovngarde master Arngeir
Your teachings will always be with us.. Sky above, voice with in
Rest well old friend. We will meet again in Sovngarde.
Damn it! I knew it!
I've always played Skyrim in Spanish, but when that guy died and I saw his face I was thinking "I swear this guy was related to Skyrim?" I thought of Paarthurnax... but it was Arngeir.

Also, last year died Max Von Sydow, Esbern's voice and the Three Eyed Raven in GoT.

They lived a long life, and I'm sure they spent their last days in peace, but it still hurts... even though I never knew them in person...

They seemed like nice people. Rest in peace, master. Jurgen Wind-Caller may guide you!
Also the Polish actor who dubbed Arngeir died too...
To be honest, I just started playing Skyrim just yesterday again.. I just went through quest "The Way of the Voice".. Rest in peace  **Arngeir.** We'll meet again.
R.I.P.
Breath and focus 😔
:(
rip
Sky above, voice within.
sovngarde awaits
I was a voice actor till i took a arrow on the knee
RIP, sir.
Corona?
We're all going to die before Bethesda gets off their asses, and stops using Zenimax to milk people for money with ESO, and finally decides to work on and release their "Crown Jewel" Elder Scrolls VI, that's been sitting on the back burner and will probably be delayed 15 fucking years after the last game released.
**F in the chat..** ***RIP*** Christopher Plummer.
Press F to Pay Respects
When did he pass
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures
Edelweiss, Edelweiss, every morning you greet me. 
RIP to a great man.
Damn I believe he is also the voice of Esbern
R.i.p bloody legend
Rip
RIP BOSS
Loved the voices in Skyrim. Sad man :'( RIP.
I knew i knew who that was!
[deleted]
He would have made a great Magneto, either him or Max Von Sydow (Esbern). Alas...
let us taste that sexy vocie
Wasn’t he also emperor palpatine in Star Wars? I know it’s not skyrim related but I was just asking about christopher plummer

When you’re a Heavy Armor, Unarmed, Assassin handing out free trips to Suplex City.

What is your sneak level?
The perfect play style
I’ve never used unarmed combat but this really makes me want to
2nd guy: "Must have been the wind."
I’m gonna make Brock Lesnar one of these days.
BY GAWD!
By far my favorite kill animation
*sees his friends get suplexed by nothing* 
i told the thralls to mop and clean this place i knew someone would get hur-
Ah yes I'm just going to walk past this gigachad and pretend I did not see him suplex my milk drinking friend in the hopes that he doesnt do that to me.
Today I learned you can WWE enemies... but how?
Is it Vanilla?
My favorite way to play
Unarmed sneak is hands down the funnest play thru of the dozens of play thrus I’ve done in Skyrim. Good for you.
I see you too are a fan of the Oxford comma
“Dude, he’s right there.”

“But he’s *CROUCHING*”
That's one sneaky heavy armor build. There's so much in this game I haven't even thought to try.
BATMAN
I’ve literally never done a play through on heavy armour because I always end up stealth oriented and want to move quicker so I always choose light. 

Any tips on stealth heavy? I know the weight of your boots affects it so it always pushed me to light armour.
I played this on release. I played it during lockdown. I’ve probably put 1K+ hours on this and just now I learn you can suplex people if you sneak attack unarmed?

*sigh*, time to reroll again.
This is a thing??? Where the fuck have I been?
I love this build
Khajiit has suplex if you have the coin
i have to try this, but with ordinator, the unarmed buff its in the light armor skill tree
This is the best playstyle I've seen since SkyrimVR Dual Dagger Assassin Goes Bananas. 

[https://imgur.com/gallery/ABtbhcG](https://imgur.com/gallery/ABtbhcG)
I always use heavy armour when I play for the first few levels lol then I get good stealth and I become the stealth armour we are all meant to be because who the fuck uses magic
Alright that's it, i'm firing up my Orc tank and spending the rest of my day off suplexin fools.
I must ask how did you achieve this?
FROM OUTTA NOWHERE
u/savevideo
"Someone will suffer for this injustice"  

*immediately gets his ass handed to him*
BAH GAWD HE HIT THEM WITH CONSECUTIVE GERMAN SUPLEXES! HE KILLED THEM!
*Brock Lesnar intro riff intensifies*
That second guy was like HOLY SHIT DAM- mustve been the wind
Is that an actual barehanded kill animation??
Npr just used the skyrim music in their interview with the Critical role peeps and it made me crave another play through. This one will definitely try a sneaky brawler build.
You gotta tell me how you sneak so well with heavy armor??? I love heavy armor so much the designs are epic but I love to play as a thief
You forgot to rob them to try leveling your pickpocketing skills
How do you even do this
does unarmed do sneak damage ?
Must’ve been the wind
what armor is that?
Why armor mod is that?
The legendary technique for destroy the enemy
LMAO wut
heavy armor unarmed assassin...Iron Man or Winter Soldier?

"oh god what happened to my friend? \*passes right by the killer\* excuse me friend... by the nine divines! there's a psychopath on the loose! assault assault! body's still warm... looks like there's a killer about"
Is it possible to learn this power?
Holy shiat i can’t stop laughing.  Thank you for posting this!
Didn’t know John Cena was in Skyrim. Even after hundreds of hours logged playing I’m still learning new things about the game.
Unmodded shitty stealth calc strikes again.
The only way it’d be better is if their heads clipped through the ground and they got stuck like that
Loreroy yenkins
I was today when I found out I could suplex, holy schmoly if you suplex two dudes is it a duplex?!
That looks fun
LMAOO I'm going to try this build
Being an illusionist assassin is always fun in my opinion
this clip sent me to suplex city.
Sneak 10000000000000000
Pictured here is a perfect example how broken vanilla sneak is.
I love this so much lmfao
Accurate portrayal of this decade
This is giving me the urge to drop my dark souls playthrough and make this build
WATCH OUT WATCH OUT!!
Very sneaky sir
This is a mighty funny video!
Fuck
More like, Neckbreaker-tropolis.
Genius. Now I wanna try unarmed
SOMEBODY STOP THE DAMN MATCH
Must have been the wind
The Batman of Tamriel
“It must have been the wind.”
AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA. use the john cena critical noise mod for maximum immersion.
Bam Bam Bronsolinio in the building!
Beautiful.... just magnificent. I'm in love
Move over stealth archer.. this is the new meta
How do you attack efficiently while sneaking and unarmed? Whenever I tried that, when I would attack, I would stop moving to attack. That time in between when I would stop to when I would deliver a punch, the enemy would be out of reach for me?
So how do you go fighting DGN's? in an unarm build...
I’ve never seen that cut scene my jaw dropped
Most fun build I’ve ever done
EAT. SLEEP. CONQUER. REPEAT
What mod is it?
Never thought of being an unarmed heavy, but now i want to do it as a redguard
Head to the orphanage
My wife is looking at me strangely as I cackle like a fucking mad man, this is hilarious!!
Someone needs to make a mod that adds a crowd cheering sound effect to these animations
I used to be an adventurer like you until I took a free trip to Suplex City.
OK now I want someone to make the rko a stealth move. Imagine sneaking up on someone and hitting them with an rko. The true meaning of rko outta nowhere 😆
Ah yes, the Batman build
SUPLEX CITY, BITCH
Is this unarmed assassination part of a mod or the game?
Can you suplex a dragon?
I... I didn't even know a build like that was viable. Now I know what my next playthrough will be. After I finish my current one, which is honestly more roleplay than anything.
That is so badass
I genuinely hated stealth in this game simply due to how absurdly fucking retarded the AI is.

"Fuckin wind, out here suplexing my friends. Ugh."
Is it possible to improve unarmed damage? Or are you stuck doing very little?
whats the heavy armor for
Only 2 suplexes? That's not even Suplex Township
How did they not notice you
i love this
Ohhhhhh RKO OUT OF NOWHERE
Lights go out. Omg 😱 omg. It’s STING! Stings coming down from the ceiling.
Damn man how were you able to sneak like that? This is my first play through and I can barely sneak around people. Also, how do you suplex?
HERE COMES THE PAIN!!
This does put a smile on my face
You could climb the cliff right after you enter the cave and get through the two gates.
"They just suplexed themselves, I wonder why that--"SPLAT
Must have been the wind.
Good lord
\[BROCK LESNAR INTENSIFIES\]
Seeing Skyrm on front page of r/all like we are back in 2011 is warming to see
Must have been the wind
Sigh. *reinstalls Skyrim*
...is this a mod? Can you legit suplex people in Skyrim?? How did I not know this...
Is this a mod, or actual kill animation?
Mage: “What?! Someone will su-“

Dragonborn: “lmao yeet”
EAT
SLEEP 
SUPLEX
REPEAT
Arguably better than playing as a stealth archer.
I like how you just stealth suplexed some dude and then he friend walks over in front of you looking at his buddy going "what happened here?." Like there isnt some large fucker in huge armor right in front of him lol. "Stealth"
“What?! Someone was- EUGHHH”
NAPS FOR EVERYBODY
Can you go into the specifics of the build? This looks like a lot of fun but I would have no ideas what to allocate my points and time into
In the mighty words of Vincent "Vinesauce" Pizzapasta:

[**SU*PLEX***](https://youtu.be/-gtk95zuGLk)
Now let's see you do that to a train.
My favorite playstyle.

Me? An assassin? Preposterous, how would I, a giant unarmed man in heavy plate, ever assassinate anyone?

*Stealth surplexes an entire bandit camp*
You wouldn't have suplexed a Train recently, have you?
Tainting the greatest playstyle by using exploits. Son, I am disappoint.
Skyrim’s version of Brock Lesnar is even morein-ring-skilled and more entertaining to watch as his WWE equivalent! Nicely done fellow
How do you get a cape?
Diabolical...I watched this 3x
Dont forget wrestler xd
This inspired me to do a "captain america" build
[removed]
that is not vanilla right?
Lmao we need an RKO mod
Mod name please. I want to suplex people
Is it a mod that makes you suplex them or is that the unarmed rear power attack? Please let it be the latter.
Chris Benoit proud af in hell :P
Suplex city.  Population?  You.
Thought this was batman arkham at first glance haha
Is this a mod? I need ir
Me:cries in my normal shout based build
What? Someone was-
I really wish Unarmed was viable in Skyrim.
Amazing game, one of my favorites. But fuck man the AI is terrible.
*Perfect-plex 

Amazing lol.
My fav play style!
Basically Batman!
Hands down the best way to play
Man, time to play Skyrim again
Someone needs to settle down
That’s like level 101 sneak how did that second guy not see you lol
Suplex city, bitch!
Lol skyrim sneak is so broken. I love it so much
Damn wind, suplexing people out of nowhere......
This is the most Bethesda thing I've seen today
Mod for RKO and you got yourself a deal
"Huh?  Must've been the wind"
What helmet are you using?
Nice mod

Is this a level above Legendary?
Seems to do what it promised, so good mod
1.eats 80 wheels of cheese

2. heart attack
I've wanted a mod where the dragon doesn't show up at the beginning and your character gets executed.
One should implement that to when one is jumpscared by some Draugr or Dwemer thing or when one eats too much fatty food.
But can you enchant a defibrillator necklace? You know, for those drauger scares and horker stew and boiled creme treat binges.
This was my original vision for the game. Thank you
"Sheer  heart attack has no weakness"
OK
Reminds me of that one Chapstick mod that gives you the Chapped Lips debuff.
[removed]
The death better be preceded by a cinematic of Alduin writing in a notebook
Well yup exactly as advertised
This looks like something from r/comedyheaven
Now you just need a Life Alert enchant.
Heart attack yes, but what about the SHEER HEART ATTACK
"You died from a heart attack"

\-"Ok"
30k upvotes on a repost that has been all over reddit? Wtf seriously
"Immersion"
Should lay off the sweet rolls.
Yeah, good. Ok.
"OK"
Has Realism gone too far?!
The kill cam better be sick or this mod sucks
Have you found Homing Nazeem
I like this mod, it works as advertised
Immersion
Can't die if you don't hit OK.
F
SHIA HATO ATTAKKU
I loved when they added heart attacks to Darkest Dungeon... At first.

Then I'd get a nice character leveled and stuff then they'd fucking die from a heart attack when the torch went out or something and it just wasn't as fun anymore.
Immersion breaking, a guy who can jog from one side of a province to another isn't getting a heart attack
The way this mod works is it sends your name and face to Kira with description of all the crimes you've committed.
This is the most voted mod related post, congrats.
But can they port this into the real life?
It’d be cool if they had a mod that gave your enemies an instant heart attack.
Lorkhan simulator
Wow never seen this before...
IS THAT A DRAGON!?!? ngh x_x
Ah, FINALLY, I’ve always wanted to randomly die from a heart attack!
Sheer Hearth Attack has no weakness...
If it made you explode, you could call it Sheer Heart Attack
Reminds me of the mod that lets your head get chopped off in the beginning and well... You can guess the rest.
Disco Elysium mod.
Ok
OK
Ok.
SHEER HEART ATTACK
Sheer heart attack?
Instant heart attack has no weaknesses!
Immersion
TBH I like how this mod is so serious, not giving a damn about anyone, just says You Died, and that simple *OK* to click.
KOTCHI WO MIRO
*Sheer Heart Attack*
Heavy activity in sub-zero temperature without adequately warm clothing. Seems realistic
Should be fake heart attack mod. Fake it when fighting Imperial guard. Then sneak attack when they walk away. Rinse and repeat.
Kira approved
you have to save like every minute when u have this mod
Haha hahaha... I love how it forces you to just say "ok" to your fcking death!

F
[Left out the best photo from the mod description](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/91148/91148-1525482720-1386734035.jpeg)
I already have that one applied in real life.
I very nearly died one night of a massive heart attack. I was that close to death 6 times. Thank god for my Drs. Anyway, having gone through it, I don't even want to put my fake characters through it. Lol
Tends to happen when you eat a thousand cheese wheels in under a second
Sheer heart attack has no weakness
Now they need to make one where you die of dysentary.
This is good, but it doesn't beat Swearing Mudcrabs.
It should be completely random. Like imagine you're 60 hours in and you have completely forgotten about the mod. Then all of a sudden boom heart attack and you're character dies forever
Jesus fuck. 

Only way to make it more realistic is making it a status ailment. 

"Blubber"

>This ailment can be gained at any point through your playthrough, eating large quantities of food in a short period of time is the only cause. When the ailment is gained, the player moves ever so slightly slower, with a -5% decrease in their stamina bar. Like other ailments it can be removed by praying to a shrine, but it also has a unique way to remove it, in that using stamina often will remove it aswell

>When you have the Blubber ailment however, it can evolve into its second stage

"Heart Problems"

>To cause this second stage, the player must continue to eat food items while under the "Blubber" debuff. A message appears in the upper corner to alert you of the change, followed by your character ragdolling for a few seconds, as if they blacked out.

>Following this event, your character moves even slower, with a -25% decrease in their stamina bar. At this stage, praying to a shrine does not remove the ailment, the only way to do so is by using stamina or a new (expensive) potion sold by some store merchants that was made to directly combat the ailment (and even then the potion has only a 10% chance of working)

Continuing to eat food beyond this point, to any degree, can cause the "Heart Attack" debuff

 >"Heart Attack" is a debuff that instantly kills you. All food can cause it, with varying degrees of % chance (an apple with 0.1%, a sweet roll with 10%, a mammoth trunk with 25% and so on)

>Any form of dammage has a % chance of causing the "Heart attack" debuff to happen when you are under the "Heart Problems" ailment,  poison is especially dangerous, while electricity is instant kill.

>And finally, While using stamina is the only form to naturally cure the ailment, using up your full stamina bar repeatedly, or in large bursts (such as strong attacks or frost dammage) can cause the "Heart Attack" debuff to occur



Also, at any random point, even if you dont have the "Heart Problems" debuff, electricity attacks have a chance of causing the "Heart Attack" debuff
OK
Walk into seemed ruins-.0001 seconds later “you died of a heart attack”
Need mod for dying by Skooma overdose.
*Insert Michael Bluth I-don't-know-what-I-was-expecting meme here*
Imagine if this was a random timed trigger.... Could go off at 1 minute... Could wait until your 100 hours in.... You never know

The dragonborn has had too many sweetrolls
Never forget to save ever again
Essential for a cold man build
Ok
I want to actually try this mod. It actually seems hilarious, like others that add unnecessarily realistic needs for Skyrim.
There's a mod idea. Loot drop from alduin. Who needs the Jagged Crown?
Does what it says on the tin, 10/10
^OK
Skyrim always reinventing the next big mod. Bravo.
Nice
Very lore friendly.
Ok
You open a chest. A NEW HAND - You died from a heart attack.
This reminds me. When my brother and I were younger we were playing Unreal, only we sucked because we were children so we used a lot of cheats.  One of the cheats was an invulnerable cheat and I recall making it suoer far into the game and then our charcater just... died... The death recap showed we had died of a heart attack.  Has anyone else ever seen that? Cause we loaded up our last save and could not recreate it.

Side note, I wanna replay Unreal now. Was the campaign worth it and does it still hold up?
When you're feathering it brother
Is it just random? Influenced by your actions? Character age? Or is it just install the mod, open your game and your dead?
Immersion
OK
I said this before, but I would be down for a playthrough with it of it means that my character has a random chance of dying. can make an interesting story
Immersion 100
I don't know what I expected.
If I was the character in that game that would be the primary way I died
You know this makes me think. This must of happened to some Extraordinary person in ancient times. Like an Alexander The Great Like figure. Someone who was a game changer and was in the the middle of doing something outstanding but then they suddenly die of something random like a heart attack... Someone who could've completely altered the world around them if given the chance.

It's extremely unlikely but even the healthiest person could succumb to a heart attack for seemingly no reason.
/r/me_irl
Maybe the best mod ever in skyrim :)
Nice!

It does make it more attractive
Hey you! You're finally awake....








You died from a heart attack
What if you see that prompt in real life when you die from a heart attack
Problem is... As far as I know heart attack were just not a thing in primitive societies... It doesn't happen until you become modernized...
They did surgery on a grape
"This is the sweetest person EVER

Nice logic.
Dies as soon as character sees a dragon... from a heart attack
Probably from all those cheese wheels y’all eat in the middle of battle.
Meridia Beacon

Oh god no
Nice move going to the top in question?
Is there a Skyrim Multiplayer editor, where you can make your own DnD Campaigns?
[ ‘He’s a black man. Nice try"
OK

Nice.

You didn't see a typo.
Darkest dungeons looking ass.
Ok
lol that’s a mod of the sub
God damn sweet rolls
this is the power of 「KILLER QUEEN’S SHEER HEART ATTACK」

Too many wheels of cheese, probably.

Ok
No mod is the best NA jungler
Sheer heart attack has no weaknesses
Not unrealistic. 

VERY good.

(Could bring a no-death run to a crashing halt though.)
Ok
oh no it kira
It's better than my own mod, the "Get Stabbed For Real" mod, where if you get stabbed in the game a knife pops out of your computer and stabs you
*ok*
Does it also come with a time traveling savior who gives you heart medicine you can choose to completely ignore and die of a heart attack anyways?
Should have done more cardio
OP, you can mod it to the hospital
Just as planned
Dang could someone please port this over to special edition I need this
Nice. I have two of them!
Nice, this is porn
*O* *K*
I’ll take a potato chip...
😂 im new to reddit and this is my first time on a community and i already love this sub lol
I'll guess that Nazeem gave you that heart attack
I wanted to endorse but something stopped working
Ok
Nice I wonder if it’s surprise mechanics
Like that mod, where Alduin never interrupts your execution, and you get beheaded.
#SHEER HEART ATTACK
Pair this up with dead is dead and you’re good to go
Hey you, you’re finally awa- you died from a heart attack.
 Your finally awake
For the role players.
This is so immersive
Is this real life?

Whats the matter? Somone should have stolen your sweatroal
Lol xd
I want that mod
Nice
Injust laughed my heart out reading about this mod and the comments. I really love the idea!
Imagine this dream I had from Elder Scrolls. Lifts-Her-Tail greets you after a long day of jerking it with Vivec. Maybe you're jerking yourself, maybe you're jerking him, it doesn't matter. He's a living god. You're honored by the opportunity. His CHIM fueled urges have left your soul empty as the Void, but you're enlightened. You return home, confused as to how anything else can compare. Anyway, this lusty maid takes you to the bedroom. You're unsure if you will find release, but you just let her do her job. "We have no butter in the pantry," she tells you. "But not to worry. I know ways to fix that." Her scaly hands grab your shaft and rhythmically bounce up and down. "I'll just make my own butter tonight." After what seems like an era, you feel the euphoria of skooma fever and god diddling bliss overwhelm you. As you finish, Lifts-Her-Tail grabs a loaf of bread. You release upon it, and collapse as your body trembles. Lifts-Her-Tail smiles and leaves you to your reverie. "Now I can enjoy this loaf in my mouth even more," she winks.

Just imagine....
*OK*
"Ok"
My grandpa installed this mod.



In real life
Sheer heart attack has no weaknesses
Ok
Kira strikes again

what I need, immersion and realism

Dude wicked. What mod is that
My favourite mod ever was the enhanced spoon mod dragon bone spoon better than most weapons below that tier (with spoon specific enchantments that made then do more DMG or other stuff like that)
[so] you’re a programmer.

new reality difficulty, you have a completely random chance of dying out of the blue from all kinds of factors, also you can catch diseases just by interacting with people
*walks out cave at beginning of game* oh no, the dragonborn, he died
Heh, I didn’t need a mod for a heart attack. [Here is the Proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/t1n4bh/so_did_anyone_else_have_a_heart_attack_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
One of my favorite mods!
They should make a high cholesterol mod with the amount of cheese wheels I eat.
Immersion
What’s the point of a mod like this?
We did it guys, our Skyrim grandma achieved 1 million subscribers!

well i hope all the new subscribes will watch her videos aswell since so many sub to her without watching. if you wish to support her then its the views and the view time that counts
I love the fact that there is a mod that puts her in the game as a follower, voiced by herself.
Was it true she had a stroke and had to relearn everything about Skyrim?
Awesome grandma. 👍
Game Rant article in 3... 2...
As a millennial lady, old ladies playing my favorite video games is literally my most favorite most wholesome thing to see about others gaming.

It’s really uncommon for their generation to try something so advanced. Especially women. To overcome a totally new interface. An incredible feat. My generation grew up with this stuff and a lot of people my age still didn’t get into gaming. Especially women.

I wish more people her age (and mine) would give them a genuine shot. They’re missing out on living in and experiencing entire different universes that the mind can get so immersed in. It’s truly a beautiful experience.
Give her vids a watch, she prefers viewers than subscribers i think bc it makes her feel like people are with her. It sounds tough bc skyrim os a boring game to watch others play but just give her a chance and she'll love it
No. _She_ did it.
The elderly scrolls
Hope she gets a cameo in the next game, perhaps as a companion? lol

The Warrior Grandma, Shir'Ley
I swear on the nine if this lady doesn't get to play Elder Scrolls 6 before she dies, I'm burning Bethesda down.
My close friend, who has since passed away, introduced me to her channel and it's been one of my favorites ever since. 


I'd like to think he'd be pretty happy to hear of this milestone.
[deleted]
"So guys we did it, we reached a million subscribers"
[Look what you made her do!](https://youtu.be/zn8M7vQimwY)
I learned about her 5 years ago and this is well deserved. She’s an amazing person ❤️
Hell yeah! She’s long deserved 1m
This is the most popular thing I've seen all week. Grandma got the nation behind her.
I’m honestly surprised to find I’m not one of them. Well, I fixed that
Well deserved
Well deserved
The one thing I noticed as of late.. she’s only getting like 1-2 k views per video. It seems like it’s more the idea of her than people actually wanting to watch her content as a whole.
Amazing 👏👏
Not that it means anything when she rarely gets above 5,000 views
[deleted]
🥳🥳
FUS RO YAY!
Proud of her
Fuck yeh Shirley!!
Did she recover from her stroke?  I remember her posting she had a stroke and couldn't play anymore.
r/wholesome
Perfect example of people wanting to support a cause the most lazy way possible. Great you pressed a button called subscribe and now feel like you did a good deed, yet you didn’t watch any videos.
I never watch her, but as popular as she is, I'd have thought she was already past a million.
I seriously hope that Bethesda makes good with the next elder scrolls game and stuffs it full of community born Easter eggs. I’d love to either have books written by/about Shirley or have a character voiced by her in the next game. She’s one of the few Skyrim based channels that I think seriously deserves it.
1 million subs and barely 5k views per video. That’s not even 1% of her subscribers. You guys are fake as fuck lmao
Awesome!
Awwww love
Yay!!!
Here's the problem:

Shirley doesn't want a million subscribers when only 10% of them actively watch her videos. She has made this VERY CLEAR and its sad people don't listen.   She makes videos out of her own fun for them.  Not for a job or career by any extent. 

While awesome she's at one million subs, I'm saddened to see her wishes be ignored about subscriptions.
Damn I remember hearing about her YEARS ago. Surprised she hasn't gotten bored
Great, now what?
[deleted]
Unpopular opinion but I'm kind of not ok with the way older people who play video games  are treated. There is amazement and a sense you think the person is unusual or badass. They are just older people playing a game because they want to. Plenty of older people play mmorpgs because they have a lot of time after retirement. My own mother played WoW for years and I know for a fact she felt the same  way I do. She didn't want to be seen as special.   
  
If you really can't imagine my perspective try thinking about a person in a wheelchair playing basketball and then a bunch of able bodied people who play basketball are just loving this guy "whooh he's just like us!" It's how you would treat a dog on a skateboard  honestly.
She does not deserve all the praise. She gives such temper tantrums when she reads a view negative comments or even honest criticism. Happened multiple times and then she swears she wont come back  yet she does. And no she is not being bullied. She behaves like a child in the body of a grandma.
I was the one millionth subscriber
But do they actually watch her?
Damn, she still alive.
Oh my god, there is a Shirley-Follower Mod :D
Ultra cool. Congrats!
Ultra cool. Congrats!
Congratulations for that.
Aaavvaaa Marrrrriiaaa
WOOT!
I'm not depressed any more:)
Let's gooooo!!
Good for her. By the time I'm old, the market will be flooded.
What a bad ass
How can I watch her content from the beginning? Her YouTube channel seems incomplete and there aren’t really any playlists to speak of.
Yay!
Good for her Skyrim grandma will reach that 2M subscribe in future
Your finally awake
Incredible
Hell yeah'!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw this on r/all and got fucking terrified
LETS FUCKKINNGGGG GOOOOOO
Focking finally!!!
Now let’s get her on Elden Ring
WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Literally about to run over to Brightwood and recruit her
SHE did it. We did little to nothing.
She was at PAX East 2022! I missed her panel! Wish I could have heard he talk her Skyrim experience!
What's her modlist?
Currently running through skuldafn which I dread but I’m watching one of her videos while I play through and it honestly makes it so much better, she’s honestly a blessing
Just what I needed to see. Been having a rough day and this made me smile. She deserves all the subscribers.
LET'S GO, GRANDMA!
That's awesome
Took the plunge,I've been meaning to do this for ages. But I'm deep into her major Bromley playthrough now and I am HOOKED.
She is an absolute legend good for her. 


Next do FroBro.
I hope Bethesda puts her in the next elder scrolls game as an npc
legend status
HELL YES
YEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!
can someone fill me in on who this is
She did a great panel discussion and Q&A panel at Pax East this year!
Congrats Shirley
I’m related to her in some way
Hooray. Can't wait to see her on Elder Scrolls 6. I wish she will Kyraneth or Mara taking a form of one of the playable races and journeys with as a companion with a quest where we will soon realize she is actually a goddess.
SHE DESERVES IT! BEST GRANDMA EVER!!
A moment of celebration for all of us, innit?!
I’m surprised she’s still alive! One million subscribers is great, but I want to congratulate her health and wish her even more of it!
Release TES 6 now, Todd Howard!
I wish the algorithm would give me notifications when she posts! 😠 it’s unfair to her honestly
Omg I forgot about her Existence
I got to admit, I HAD to go and check out her YouTube channel. I've watched an episode or two so far. She is very cool! I kind of geeked that she's older than me, cause sometimes I feel like I'm one of the older gamers myself. And honestly, even though I'm a returning gamer (after a 12 year hiatus of raising little ones, my youngest is now 9), she knows WAY more than I do in the gaming world.
Tell Shirley about Lovers lab
“Hello Grandkids”
Now then let.get her to 2 mil.

Go go go
She deserves it!
Congratulation
<--- 62 yo gaming grandma. I play Skyrim, FO, HZD,HFW, WoW, Neverwinter, etc...etc.. i love Shirley, she deserves way more attention and way more ppl who sub AND watch her vids!
she deserves a platinum plaque for sure
Congrats ! She is really a sister skyrim player!
Lets goooo
Look at Curry man, so Inspirational

The 10 seconds of Family time, before I leave again for another 3 years.

Takes a sweetroll from their bedside table

Gives it to them as a gift

"Wow, thanks!!!!"
I always feel like a bit of a cunt once I have a full household.  Like, I got married just to have a babysitter.
*no fast travel playthrough*

Where's work today honey?

"Oh I was gonna walk down to Riften, swing by and say hello to the guys at the Ragged Flaggen, then I'm gonna have lunch in the the Blue Palace, deliver a package to the Thalmor Embassy and stop by Windhelm to sign up for the Stormcloaks. 

I should be back in about 32 days."
"Mom, why are we living in poverty when dad is hoarding gems and priceless, ancient weaponry all in our back room?"

"Your father might need them some day. Now eat your Sweetroll he found in a sealed drauger coffin."
I do find it funny how irresponsible skyrim players are as parents
Oh sure, your kid befriended a normal pet. Mine scared the bejesus out of me when he showed up with a mudcrab. Sounds almost as horrible as chorus.
Hope this is fleshed out a little more in Elder Scrolls 6
That's what stewards and housecarls are for.
"I'll be back. I just need to get some milk."
I wish I could just erase all my memories of playing this game so I can start all over again, because it's been long enough for me to forget most of what I did on my first playthrough but I still remember enough to not have that same feeling of awe and exploration anymore. The first time I had kids I would play with them/give them gifts whenever I came back to my house, now I just go "yeah yeah hush gotta put these dragon bones in a chest before leaving for 5 years".
I moved Lydia into Lakeview to be my steward and left Lucia alone in Breezehome with her pet Fox 😔
I always start a family in the end of a playthrough. I imagine that my character settle downs and live peacefully with their family telling them story’s of their adventures. So when I stop playing as them they are not alone.
It especially bad if you marry someone like Farkas or Aela...and then leave them to look after the kids (somehow I don't think Aela would be doing much of that).
they grow up so never
That’s terrible.. who’s gonna defend them from giants, dragons, bandits, wolves and mucrabs
You've grown so much!!!

Ehhh Dad.... I'm here. Yes, that's your granddaughter.
I always adopted the girl in Whiterun and the other in Windhelm. Felt really bad for their backstories
“Dad-vahkiin! You’re back from the market to buy cigarettes! Are you here to take care of us?”

Uhh, sure. I think I forgot to pick up some milk though. I’ll be right back
Honestly marriage in skyrim could be better, like you should have to visit your family or they would abandon you
Thats why im hesitant to marry anyone. It's like the wife thinks: wow im married to the savior of nirn and stuff!''



Dragonborn: *comes home after months of vanishing*


Wife: by the gods youre back me and the kids missed you so much we thought you-


Dragonborn: yeah cool hey wheres that pile of dragonbones i left? Oh here it is okay bye


Wife: hey w-


*door slams*
Some dude in Skyrim: Yeah, my dad said he was going to the Bannered Mare for a drink. That was 30 years ago....
Everybody's kids always have cute pets likr dogs, rabbits, foxes, etc. And my kids *always* bring home freaking crabs 😑
My skyrim kids be like: Are you drunk mommy?  Every time you try to move something it ends up upside down on the floor.  And why do you keep jumping on the tables and kicking shit all over the place?  
  
What is fucking WRONG with you?
Whenever I play , I always make sure to come back after every mission .I am no absent father .
My kids haven't yet brought home a pet. It's been ages. Lucia had brought a fox (Kit) in my first playthrough.
“Dad/Mom! You came back to visit me!”

*me, holding a metric tonne worth of junk I need to square away* “Uh... yes! I.. sure did.”

“Did you bring me anything?”

*rummages through sack to find some food that I accidentally picked up while blind looting a bunch of corpses* “Here you go!”

“Why is there blood on it-“

“Don’t ask questions you don’t want answered.”
"Hello, my love.  Back from some adventure, I bet."  

\-Ysolda, probably
The family should age and experience should progress too.  After 3 years, you find out you’ve been cuckold.  Your kid hates you for being absent most of your life, taken up drugs and hangs with loser trolls.
Moved my kids into one of my houses and I don't remember which oops
I had forgotten that I had children. It's been years. They're probably dead by now.  Oh well that's what they get for choosing an Argonian for a Papa.
Whenever i visit my house in solitude i give them daggers or money and let them run off while i go kill someone in the city or fight dragur in a mountain.


“where’s pa?”

“last i checked...killing the court wizard”

You're a family guy
Ya gotta ask, were we really that much better that [whoever ran the orphanage, I can’t remember her name]? I mean, YES, SHE WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE, but we’re also pretty neglectful.
Well I at least stop by and see them more often than that. I admit that it's usually it's to drop off the gear and loot from my latest adventure, but it still counts that I'm home to see them and my spouse while I'm doing that. I mean they come running up to you as soon as you get inside even when they are suppose to be in bed, how can you not see them?
"Papa, you're home and I haven't seen you in a traumatizing amount of time! Can I have some money?"
It would be cool if there was a mod that aged your children if you adventure long enough.
I’d fully expect to come back and find my wife having an affair with my bard or my housecarl or my wagon driver
Well I guess my dad is the dragonborn
Entering Blackreach for the first time
I stopped visiting my kids after I got a house in Riften, got tired of the complaining
i love how popular this sub still is
You’re a good parent! I’ve never visited the kid I adopted...
What house is that?
Love it!
It seems weird but now that I think of it, it was actually pretty common in the olden days.
Child: “I love you, Dad/Mom!”

Dragonborn: “Yeah”
Who did you adopt?
Lol who else always adopts 1 boy and 1 girl
This is comedy
Is it wrong that after a while of traveling and exploring i dont remember where me and my family lived so i end up searching every household i have and i have them all
Always carry two gifts with you so you don’t disappoint them upon return.
There should be a mod that makes them more excited when we return. Especially the wife.
Do the kids you adopt age or do they stay like 8 forever
Whenever I do this, I just headcanon it to whatever character I’m using simply providing them with shelter and a warm bed, sort of making sure they’re okay, but not full on raising them
7000 steps, of course
Do you at least return with a delicious tin of fatback and weathered doll for them to play with?
At this point god knows how much time I have into various iterations of Skyrim. I go out questing become the leader of any thing ever created, solo fight dragons, single handedly decide the fate of Skyrim etc. I always make sure to adopt as when I return home, to whichever of the several places I own I'm using as my main base, my children don't give a flip about my exploits. They are just happy to see me. I always go out of my way to get them sweets/toys/clothes. It seems so perfect as they are not in awe of my character as the dragonborn, but are excited as I am their father/mother etc.
Finds a frostbite spider..."can we keep it?" No! "Here''s a wooden sword instead"
I come back to my house like every week to store my two hundred pounds of dragon bones
Ya know, they could have made it so that spending time with them was wroth it.  But they didn't.

-mom, why dad spend years out of home?
-because he cant stop of doing side quest
I finished it once, so i put a boat load of mods on there, one of them was one where you can give kids anything, i gave them a wooden sword... with maxed chaos enchantments, and it was the most op wooden sword ever(maybe) i hope she killed all the kids there, those annoying fuccs
How you get a pet rabbit
Thats why I got a wife for.
Dragonborn: "Maybe I could adopt you."

Kid: "Aw, no fooling. You really mean it?" 

DB: "Sure kid. I'll be just like the dad you never had, son." 

Kid: "Wow, thanks...pa.

2 days later

Kid: "Ma, where's pa?"

Mom: "He done told you he'd be just like the dad you never had." 😐
I visit home every few ingame days......to empty my full inventory of stolen necklaces in some random chest.
Honestly, sometimes I wish I could get inside and store rare items quick enough before they notice as the ultimate hide n seek. If my two daughters are outside, I should be able to sneak pass them. Damn, just give me the option to store gifts in their chess sometimes.
Just like my dad
Kill the rabbit, put it in the display case
Nah, I make frequent visits to drop of my dragon scales and bones til I get my smithing up!
Welp, here I go playing Skyrim again...
Whats wrong with ur dog?

Skyrim belongs to the Nords

I have never had a family in skrim
Is this dragon ball?
[deleted]
The fact they were taking Lonzo before the draft
How did you get them a pet rabbit?
By Azura By Azura By Azura! i forgot i don't see my first character family for like 6 months!
It's a random encounter. When you come back they will ask for treats, or to play games, one of them will one day approach you with a pet and ask to keep it. Bunny, mudcrab, fox, mini frostbite spider... I can't remember the others if any.
No mods. Just the hearthfire dlc
Who cares? They're adopted.
Where’s Lidya? Is she safe, is she alright?
It's such a shame that the 3 manor houses are essentially identical. Seems like pure laziness to make every interior detail the same.
I usually move the wife and kids into a house I have no intention of ever going back to.  You guys enjoy Breezehome, I'll go build a nice cabin in the woods.
Dude how come you got the normal kids mine brought home a fucking skeever as a pet not a rabbit.
Building my house for the fifth time. At least they’ll have a nice house before I leave
You give them ten seconds? Usually: I walk in punch my son in the face, kill my daughters pet, kick all the dishes off the table, drop all my stuff in the appropriate spots and, leave.
I lost Lydia for years only to find her hanging around in breezehome
Goes through kids chest and steals all the health potions
First time a showed up to my house after adopting a kid, there was a mudcrab in my entrance hall. I killed it, then my kid runs up asking if they can keep it as a pet. Whoops.
One of your children brought home a bunny. That’s nice, mine brought home a skeever.
I never got the home, family, adopt a kid part of the game.  


I just want to kill stuff.  


But, then I got an arrow to the knee.
"Dad left for some mammoth milk"
They do be playin doe
