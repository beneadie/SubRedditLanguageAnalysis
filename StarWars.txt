A personal message from Ewan McGregor.

Ewan Mcgregor proves once again why he is the perfect choice for Obi-wan
Really awkward because celebration just happened and they all had a great time. Now they have to deal with the crazies.
You can dislike a character, or even think an actor’s performance is mediocre. But if you’re sending a human being hateful messages on social media or posting them elsewhere, you should know that Obi-Wan Kenobi himself is deeply, deeply disappointed in you. 

You don’t want to be a racist or an asshole. You want to go home and reconsider your life. 👋
Just watched Moses Ingram’s IG stories where she talked about being bombarded with hundreds of racist DMs.

Regardless of those racists being a vocal minority in the fanbase, it’s good that cast members and producers like Ewan, and Lucasfilm through the official SW social media accounts, are publicly standing by her and denouncing this type of behavior.

It’s a nice change of pace from what happened during the Sequel Trilogy, where people like Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran were left to address or ignore this kind of stuff on their own.
It’s like no one learned anything from Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best.  

1000% with Ewan here. If you’re bullying any of these actors, you’re not a Star Wars fan at all and we don’t want you.
I am glad that he flat out said that people that spew hate like this are not Star Wars fans. They should not be considered a part of this community. Fuck those racist assholes.
Glad to see Ewan saying this! Sad to see bullying like this happening at all. I think Moses has been doing great so far and if you feel differently there are ways to express that without attacking the actor/actress themselves.
I love this guy, I love Obi Wan Kenobi and I love Star Wars. Nothing but happy times and moments they give me every time I watch a movie/Tv Show about it. 

I don't have friends, I barely go out, I barely talk to people and in my moments of depression and shit I always find something related to Star Wars to watch, read or play. 
Is just helps me to live. It really does.

 So it kinda hurts me seeing how this beautiful SW world has such a shitty fans. I really hate those guys.
Dub so big i had to save it in the archives
Man I really hate these vocal minority haters.
Star Wars fans are so weird. 

Y’all understand the disconnect between real life and Star Wars right? Y’all understand these are actresses and actors reading scripts? 

I swear there are some STUPID people on this planet
Not a Reva fan, yet, but this shit is crazy. Please for the love of the force. F**k off racists we don’t need you here.
Star wars cast and Lucasfilm finally defending the cast from racism

We won
And Twitter is absolutely full of folks trying to downplay this, justify it, try to reverse it so everyone calling them out is racist or just straight pretend that racism wasn’t around until Disney took over.
Watch these people somehow twist it into him saying that anyone who doesn’t like Reva is racist
Hello there you racists...


Seriously wtf is with people? IT IS ACTING.
Don’t downvote.

Angry upvote… so many need to hear this.
Star Wars on Twitter: Hayden Christensen returns as Darth Vader, joining Ewan McGregor in OBI-WAN KENOBI

Just give me Liam Neeson talking to Obi Wan for force ghost training.
If I die before this I’ll be pissed
What is happening this year man

Tobey back now Hayden
I SUDDENLY LIKE SAND AGAIN
This is where the fun begins
FUCK YES
Justice for my man Hayden
Holy fuck they just straight up confirmed Hayden is coming back too! Fuck yes! Let’s fucking do it
This and Ahsoka series bloody hell I’m buzzing.
i’m literally going fucking nuts that it’s happening
Hayden Christensen with actual good writing? Sign me the fuck up
*somehow, Hayden has returned*
Is that fucking sand they used in that teaser.
10 year old me going insane
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
Everyone liked that
LET’S TRY SPIN OFFS, THAT’S A GOOD TRICK
Everyone is excited, but like how is this going to work? He’s not the voice of Vader and Vader is wearing a mask at this point in the timeline. If he is ever shown it could only be in brief scenes with his helmet off or in flashbacks where they would have to de-age him.
[deleted]
I got fucking chills reading that lmao

I'm so glad people are appreciating Hayden now, and I'm glad Star Wars isn't forgetting him. 

He is and always will be Anakin Skywalker.
This must mean prequel era flashbacks. 

Hes hardly coming back to stand in the suit while JEJ does the Vader voice.
I’m gonna fuck myself

Edit: thanks for the silver and heartwarming award!!

Edit 2.0: thanks for all the rewards!!!

Edit 3.0: HOLY FUCK GOLD AND PLATINUM!?!?!? Now I have enough coins to fuck myself with sand
Hopefully the beginning of the Christenaissance
I am so happy for the guy.

Revenge of the Sith just took on a whole new meaning for this actor.
It really is special how the Prequels along with Hayden have transformed over the years from mocked and scorned by SW elites to now being so beloved by the fanbase that announcements like this illicit such a positive response.
Well, it's James Earl Jones isn't it? Hayden is essentially 'guy in suit'.
RETURN OF THE KING
Visible. Fucking. Happiness.
Gimme the fucking SAND
I’m crying in the club rn
There is a non zero chance we see a Maul Vader fight
Redemption arc of the century
I don't know what to do with my hands!!!!!!
I felt a great disturbance in r/prequelmemes, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in joy
THE BOYS ARE BACK!
I hope we get to see a bit of dark/in-depth Vader, like we do in the comics.  
Beyond hyped and Much Love to Hayden!
MY CHILDHOOD! 15 FUCKING YEARS IVE WAITED
Literally just lost my high ground now. Gotta get up from the floor i just fell at
Awesome.  He was a great Vader (besides the shit dialogue he had to deal with).  Watching him flip on the anger with Padme when he called her a liar was awesome...
Live action flashbacks with Ahsoka please?
This is the highest upvoted post of all time on the sub. Holy shit. That’s actually insane, I’m so excited.
[deleted]
Maybe it was planned all along....To get Hayden to return when he's much older.
We are finally going up, not down.
Womp Rats,  a new @StarWars series @DisneyPlus, follows a family of indigenous beings living on Tatooine after they have come under attack by a local farm boy on his T-16.  The series explores the family's struggle for survival and quest to find the identity of the mysterious attacker.
Am I the only one wondering how this’ll work? Vader didn’t know Obi-Wan was alive in ANH, unless it’s two concurrent stories or some thing
I'd be fine with him in flashbacks, but I really don't want Vader and Obi-Wan to meet at all between III and IV. Their duel in ANH doesn't really mean as much if they just saw each other last week.
They announced like 7 new series and I don’t know what to do with my hands. ￼
And now we have suicide rates drop to zero
Today is a good day to be a Star Wars fan!
Someone kiss me!
Prepare for my arrival
Impressive, most impressive
Had to come back here to comment on such a historical moment. I'm beyond excited and happy to see him back
HOLY SHIT I AM SO EXCITED
This is where the fun begins!!!
Wait I thought he played Anakin
Yes!!
This is the way!
Taiki making a movie, Ashoka will have her own show and Hayden is back, am I dreaming?
"Now this is podracing!"
If the opening line of this series isn’t Hello There, I’ll be very sad
Cue James Earl Jones laying down a few hours of script asap and make sure he doesn't get covid.
It’s weird people still think (or ever thought) Hayden ruined the prequels.  He was poorly directed but that was the least of the problems with those movies.  I mean, seriously, Jar Jar.  Who’s idea was that?  It wasn’t Hayden’s.
Good I actually like hayden as an actor and I feel given the right writers and director he will show his acting range.
The circle is now complete
No fucking way. We get to see our boys in action again!
This is going to be soooo good, I know Hayden is cast as Vader but I hope they have plenty of flashbacks of him as Anakin. He deserves it.
Even with the writing in the prequels, Ewan and Hayden ALWAYS had great chemistry together. This is going to be amazing.
This is where the fun begins!
Made it to the Guinness book of world records, 2020

The post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3&st=k089mt0z&sh=f2908b00
So both most downvoted and upvoted comments on reddit are SW related?
I'm sure EA feels a sense of pride and accomplishment for that.
One funny part is that EA's karma increased because of the comment.

"Why?" you ask. Because after a small number of  downvotes on a comment  Reddit  stops any more of those downvotes affecting your score. So when the EA comment became so famous that people kept voting and voting, the  600,000+ downvotes weren't counting, but the small percentage of upvotes were continually getting added to their karma, giving them a 10,000+ increase in their karma.
But. The game did change for the better as a result so double win
Reddit paid for that record to advertise Reddit.

You're posting a Reddit advertisement to Reddit.
*Twice the pride, double the fall.*
Battlefront 2 is a lot better now. All the heroes are immediately unlocked.
I downvoted that post, and I'd do it again if I could.
Crazy to think that the reddit rebellion completely changed the face of the game. The Star Wars battlefront II that we have today is the direct result of the internet coming together and demanding change for the better. We didn’t vote with our wallets, we were just loud as all hell in a forum and the result was a Star Wars game that is pretty damn good now.
"A sense of pride and accomplishment" is up there with the whole "Do you guys not have phones?" fuck-up. At least EA took the hint and fixed up Battlefront II.

Nice stats to have
We did it bois
You didn't unlock those characters through lootboxes.

ugh.
[John Oliver talked about the Guinness Book recently.](https://youtu.be/-9QYu8LtH2E?t=883) This is just the last five minutes of the video but I recommend the whole thing.
Nice.
Can I beat this record?
Down vote me
I love shitting on EA as much as anyone and downvoted that comment myself, but why in the shit is "Most-downvoted comment on Reddit" a Guinness Book of World Records category at all? I loathe all of these "Most plates spun simultaneously while listening to death metal" type of awards.
Wow, now I can actually say I contributed to a Guinness World Record.
And now here we are, and everyone loves the game. They really turned it around.
And in typical internet outrage fashion, that wasn't even correct. You never had to get heros through lootboxes
please tell me youtube rewind also got in the book
Hey, being the most anything in America is impressive right?
Oh man that was a total shitstorm.
I thought you could also unlock it by playing a ton though. Why does it say "through loot boxes"?
The intent is to provide EA with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different world records.
I would have loved to be present in the EA/DICE offices the day that happened.
This is the top post on r/starwars. Sad
Meanwhile, in the Rocket League fandom: "We're getting rid of gambling!" 

Fans: "You're ruining the game! REEEEE Epic bad!" 

I don't understand gamers.
It's mad to think that you had to actually buy heroes at launch, I remember being so excited that I finally had the 80k credits for Luke and Vader.
Wait for what? I haven't spent a penny and they're readily avaliable for 4,000 battle points. Did I glitch it or something?
To be fair, loot-boxes aside, I'm not against the idea of "play to unlock things", if it's done in a non-random way.
With so much technology added, the Guinness Book Of World Records must be getting huge.
Not exactly the best of reasons to make it into that book.
Real talk though, they saved the game and I'm so happy they did. Idk what happened and why there was a sudden shift but I'm glad
I like to think Guinness sent EA a plaque for this record like I’ve seen for some other records before. I’m sure they were very proud.
Wait that was 2017? Wtf
where's my certificate of accomplishment?

Hey /u/-amsha-,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
What is the most upvoted comment though?
Its funny, because 683k is just some shitty, outspoken minority to EA. The rest of the ignorant community will buy their shit up like candy, and thats like...20 million people. So, we're totally fucked when it comes to EA.
THIS IS SO LAMEEEE
Let's make this the most upvoted! 😀
Now lets make this post the nost upvoted to let everyone sees it
EA is the biggest piece of garbage out there. Never buying any of their games ever again. Lost a life time customer.
[Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
It's not too late.. If you haven't already downvoted you still can.
I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that I was one of those downvotes
EA is full of shit
So did 600k down votes change anything?
I bet this gave them a sense of pride and accomplishment.
It's gained points since then. It's at 667,720
I helped :)
Glad to know I was one of those.
Who the hell keeps giving them platinum awards?
Ya have to give them credit for not deleting the comment after all this time
The heroes could not, in fact, be found in loot boxes during that time.
I wish it was still the geraffes are just long horses post
r/recordyoudontwant
I’m kinda sad that this can no longer be downvoted :(
Im pretty sure it is the most voted thing in all of reddit
I hope this makes EA full of that "pride and accomplishment" they talked about.
I don’t know how they’ve gotten the new movies and shows so so right but the games so so wrong
I was there
Awh. I'm proud to be part of the many hundreds of thousands who watched this unfold at the time. I love seeing every subreddit come together with 1 goal :')

My uncle actually asked me that Christmas what popular games he could buy for his son. I remember telling him a variety of things including getting him Fortnite but I remember specifically telling him not to buy him Battlefront 😁
How does the EA account have 12,000 Karma?

It has like less than 2,000 total upvotes and literally nearly 1 million downvotes. 

Not even counting the downvotes, where did the extra 10,000 karma come from?
Downvote this comment pls
I hope this gives EA a sense of Pride and Accomplishment, Well earned.
GG EA! You're in the Guinness Book! You deserve this. You've completely earned it.
Congrats EA you made the record book! Where's YOUR sense of pride and accomplishment?
Imagine the karmic destruction on that account.
this is amusing but not top-post on r/starwars material
We did it Reddit!
"Star wars fans upset about something" 

Classic
Gamers truly united back then...
It would be cooler if it was legitimate rather than a brigade/bandwagon/meme.

A *very slim* margin of those were organic or genuine votes and we all know it.
I love going through u/EACommunityTeam comment history and seeing the insane amount of downvotes
Bullshit tho
Why did they make “videogames” one word?
We did it, Reddit!
I wish they kept this scene

In Anthony Daniels' biography he describes how this was the scene he was most proud of in Empire, because he tore down the sign in one try which was near impossible to do with the shitty gloves
IIRC, there was a room on Hoth in Shadows of the Empire where a Wampa would maul you or a Stormtrooper once opened.
I think it has something to do with the fact that George Lucas didn't want any paper in the Star Wars-universe?

It's just a wild guess of course.
Don’t Dead Open Inside
I bet they cut it, because why would the Rebels have Wampas in their fort? Especially after one of 'em almost eaten Luke. There was a whole sorta subplot if you will with them, like the monster in the closet.
Fun fact: in SWBF2 (2005), you can find this poster in Echo Base. You can also hear Wampas growling near it
I am fluent in 6 million forms of pranking your chump ass

-C3P0
It is very clunky, but it’s fun. 

The scene that I really wish would have made it into a movie is Luke building his green lightsaber. It would have been at the very beginning of RotJ before 3PO and R2 went to Jabba’s Palace. It might have interrupted the pacing, but I think it’s neat to show.
"open the blast doors..."

*"CLOSE THE BLAST DOORS! CLOSE THE BLAST DOORS!*"
This is a fun, silly scene. It shouldn't be there.

It takes place in the middle of the Hoth evacuation. It is supposed to be a tense sequence - starting from "General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four" pretty much all the way to when Luke gets to his X-Wing (or when the Millennium Falcon takes off). This whole chunk of the film is a carefully-paced, action sequence, which builds up tension (with a couple of outlets), puts the main characters under quite a bit of pressure, has quite a bit of death (of good guys as well), and has a fairly sombre outcome (the good guys lose; sure, many of them escape and survive, but their base is destroyed and a lot of them die). It's not the kind of sequence you want to throw jokes into.

There is some humour in there (as there is throughout the OT), but it mainly comes from the characters being themselves; particularly Han Solo making one-liners and quips at people - but that's what he does, and fits with his character (the more serious he gets, the more he tries to deflect with insults etc. - Leia does the same). And for this part of the time, it all happens while furthering the plot in some way. The one exception is C-3PO being dragged through the door after it shuts in front of him - and personally I find that shot a little jarring and out of place.

This shot (the wampas and Snowtroopers) requires three bits in the film to make it work; something to establish the Rebels have captured Wampas or have a problem with Wampas getting into parts of the base (iirc this was in the script at some point, not sure if it was ever filmed). Second, we need the set-up of C-3PO removing the sign during the high-stakes race to the Falcon. Third, we need the pay-off when the Snowtroopers, chasing the Rebels, open the door. That's three decently-long shots or bits of script dedicated to a joke, which aren't furthering the plot.

Finally, this sequence involves C-3PO acting out of character. Why would he remove the sign? That would go against protocol, surely? Why does he stop when in danger of being left behind? We don't even care about the Snowtroopers being mauled by wampas; maybe if it slowed them down for a bit longer and that had a clearer pay-off later it might work, or if someone other than C-3PO had removed the sign (showing sneakiness and cunning - not traits 3PO is known for). But as it is, it doesn't quite fit.

So for that scene to be included, we have to break the drama, add in 2-3 extra shots with no plot reason, have to pull someone out of character, all for a single joke where the punch line is some random Snowtroopers getting attacked by a wampa arm.

I'm glad someone said no to that scene. I wish there was someone like that working on the Prequels and Sequels to say no to some of the random jokes.
Having seen the rest of the content from what was cut, it's REALLY good it was cut. There was another 45 minutes of *terrible* Wampas-rampaging-through-base footage that went along with it
They left out the funniest part at the end when Vader strolls up and they exchange confused looks before Vader just walks off
My favorite part is the Snow Trooper at the door controls just “noping” it closed as soon as the Wampa grabs his cohort. 😂
Removing hazard signs isn’t something a protocol droid would do!

Still, love that scene and, yes, it should’ve been in the final edit.
Every single kid that played Shadows of the Empire knows about this room
He then shouts "You got punked" in 6 million languages
Is this what would be the first canonical appearance of paper in Star Wars?
Yeah, this scene adds a weird bit of detail to the base on Hoth; that it had such a Wampa problem that they just evacuated part of the base and were like "fuck it, you can have it. Nobody go in there!"  
  
To me, little flavor additions like that really bring a setting to life.
This may be the funniest thing C3PO ever did.
#releasethetrueepisodeV
“C3PO YOU FUCKER” 😂
I like how they put this into Shadows of the Empire. Scrub to 2:52 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNPAv-fyNhY&feature=share
C3P0 is way too self-concerned to even think of setting a booby trap for the Empire
[deleted]
This finally explains all of the Wampas inside Echo Base during Shadows of the Empire!
C3-PO running away has the same motions of a muppet running away.
This room was also included in the [Sega Star Wars Trilogy Arcade game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvyEQZNOm3U&t=4m58s).
I can hear the Wilhelm scream now
Could definitely see this in lego star wars tho
I just love that the stormtrooper operating the door makes no motion whatsoever to help his comrade.
“Why do we have that monster door?”  “Cause mind your own fucking business Keith goddam”
That room in the shadows of the empire makes so much more sense now.
I just watched this movie and I even saw the door
Could definitely see this in lego star wars tho
I love that the other two dudes just stand there like “huh... that was *weird*” haha
I’m gonna be honest I’m kinda glad it was kept out. It’s a fun scene but the build up it would and its result would have been a distraction to everything going on especially the Assault on Hoth.
This scene wouldn't have fit thematically with The Empire Strikes Back. It's silly, cheap, slapstick humour that belongs in Spaceballs or a Charlie Chaplin skit.
All I can hear the moment after he tears it and runs away is Zoidbergs "woop woop woop"
I can hear the wilhelm scream they inevitably would have dubbed in!
This was shot before the accident. Mark Hamill’s accident forced a re-write.   They had the beast. So they just moved the interaction with the cast to taking down Luke.  Changing the opening to what it is now. 

Orsen Wells said the ultimate filming was capturing happy little accidents.  Mark wouldnt say it was happy but accident for sure.
"No. C3PO is always scared" George Lucas.
That one stormtrooper is like “NOPE” as his buddy gets yeeted through the door by the Wampa and quickly closes it on him.
Wasn't the original scene where Luke is attacked by a Wampa only added to explain why Luke's face had a scar on it from then onwards as Mark Hamil was in an accident between the recording of A New Hope and  Empire Strikes Back?
They skipped the part where Darth Vader comes in and looks disappointed.
I laughed but it does kinda break his personality. Being a robot that would not want to break rules. 
Even translating that Sith ad hoc computer map not computer thing he had to reboot.

Does he elsewhere express breaking rules? or does?
As an aside, would this go against asimovs law of robotics? Yes right. His direct action caused a human harm. But what if he was told to remove all the yeti signs, but not WHY he was removing them? The result would be the same, dude getting yucked by yeti, but as an unknown result of the robot...makes me think.
He did not follow the 3 laws of robotics and let hams die...
This is the kind of thing I wish was added back and completed in the special editions vs some of the special edition things we got lol. This scene (add another one of wampas being a problem in the base for context) and some of the Luke training with Yoda scenes ( here: [https://youtu.be/rnXI\_LT42KY?t=50](https://youtu.be/rnXI_LT42KY?t=50) ) would have been great.  


What I like about this is that it's a welcome surprise, it's the kind of assholery R2-D2 would do, but coming from C-3PO makes it hilarious and extra awesome.
I love that 3PO runs away like a muppet
This is hilarious but it really, really does not match the tone of the rest of the scene, or the rest of the movie. They were right to keep it cut but I'm glad we get to see it!
You know, I just recently rewatched the original Star Wars, it had been well over 10 years... and I realized part of what I liked about them is the silly little jokes they had in it, that was seriously missing from the new movies. They started taking themselves so seriously, it lost the joy.
Misses part where Darth Vader comes along to investigate and without needing to say anything he makes it clear that they should keep moving and forget the guy that just got eaten
:) Hahahahaha, I always liked this scene. I think if they left it in the movie, it would've added to the escape in many ways.
It seems uncharacteristic for C3PO to do this unless instructed to by someone.
Haha this is awesome.
If you can learn some basic ASL, (American Sign Language) you can really make someone's day, especially a big Star Wars fan.

You are an amazing human being. May the force be with you always.

Edit: I am actually talking about Fluke Skywalker in this if you haven’t realized it’s not Mark. I love Mark Hamill too, but I feel this guy is a home grown hero and have mad respect for what he does.
You’re such an awesome person and part of the SW community. I’ve seen your actions for years and it’s truly amazing.
I cannot express how awesome this is
And that just made my faith in humanity just a bit stronger.
Man, you really are the best. You're like Santa with an awesome beard.

You're why they celebrate Life Day.
I use British Sign Language and this was awesome to see, didn't know Fluke Skywalker was using American Sign Language too! Kudos on you, mate. This is the way
Zach galifianakis has always been a really stand up guy
I hope Mark Hamill takes you to dinner one day & everyone in the restaurant gets very confused.
This is so pure....
Hi Fluke! How long did it take you to learn ASL? And do you have any suggested resources?
Always wholesome u/imflukeskywalker
Thank you, Sir, for what you do! Cheers mate
Sign language is like the force, but instead of moving objects you’re putting words/images into people’s minds.
Man 1st off if I didn't know better and saw you I'd say you were Mark Hamill. 2nd you are an amazing person for everything you do.
I started learning sign language but then I met someone in a neighbouring country who could also do sign and I still couldn't talk to them ..
The fact you asked him if you can give him a hug, instead of just going for it, is awesome beyond all reckognition. Impressive, most impressive!
There's a sign for "jedi"!? that's too damn cool
WHY IS MARK HAMILL THE GREATEST HUMAN EVER? Seriously, this guy could’ve made his movies and just gone off and left us all behind. But he didn’t, and he continues to set an example, not only for being an amazing celebrity and doing things like this but by being the kindest and most noble person anyone could be, regardless of the cameras are on him or not. He truly is a Jedi master

Edit: thank you all for pointing out this is not Mark Hamill, but damn it fooled me. He’s still awesome, and so are all the Lukes out there, apparently. Amazing cosplay by u/imflukeskywalker and truly heartwarming seeing this interaction
Is there really SL for the word Jedi? THAT IS AWESOME!
What’s up fluke skywalker? Haven’t seen you in a while
I just love how Boba is stoically observing the situation from behind like he's guarding the guy.
So the guy in the wheelchair made Hamill's day
I really like Mark Hamill. Seems like a genuinely good human.
I think you are a bit beyond basic ASL, but that's really awesome my dude!
Beautiful
>	if someone COOL learns sign language 

Pretty sure they don’t want me to come up to them “hey, I’m Robert, I work in accounting.. how.. do you like legos..?”
Watched this twice before I realized it wasn’t Mark. Unbelievable job! You look exactly like him and kudos to you sir for all you do.
You should all remember that mark hamill is actually one of the worst human beings alive. 

He's tried to kill the batman on numerous occasions and I'm sure he's killed a civilian or two along the way. 

Don't let his marketing team fool you, this is astrotutfing
Just when I thought Mark Hamill had long passed Ideal Human status. What a truly, nay, aggressively wonderful person.

Edit: just educated myself on this whole thing, and I must say, being a mensch at this level is Hamill status for sure. This makes me even happier — there are at least TWO Mark-Hamill-shaped people out there using their powers for good. Thank you, Fluke, for showing us the path away from the Dark Side.
Mr. Fluke Skywalker. I never reply to anything on Reddit, but I will today just to say you are an awesome human being for all the things you do. May the force be with you.
I actually thought this was the real Mark Hamill at first
I learned basic, and I mean BASIC, ASL and it has made so much impact on helping people when I bartend and volunteer at the library.

Like, I have to spell a lot of shit which takes a while because I don't know the true signs, and then of course I often need them to spell back, but seeing their eyes light up when they realize they don't have to attempt to vocalize or write shit down really feels good for the heart.
Awesomeness, over 9000!!!
It's amazing what a little compassion will do.
I think it matters a lot to make a little effort like this. Even if it’s just a few phrases, it’s something you worked on just for moments like this and I think it means a lot to Deaf people sometimes. I know a decent amount of sign and I loved the few occasions I’ve responded to a deaf person in sign at work. They’ll often either have written something down or they speak a few words with general gestures and I sign at them and the way their posture relaxes after makes me so happy. Their whole demeanor changes as we start signing and you have a friend for a moment. Deaf culture is really wholesome. I always imagine what it would be like to be someone else and I like to create these moments where someone feels more comfortable in my presence.
Damn these people always chopping their onions near my eyes
You love to see it
That Boba should be the BoBF one since he seems chill enough to not be firing at Luke... Hehe.

Kidding aside, this is wholesome. Good stuff!
That was really heartwarming. Fluke Skywalker, you are the best!
That’s awesome
Dude, everytime you post something you get cooler and cooler. Thanks for being a beacon of the light side to the fandom.
I was loving the vibe until the photo op when Luke tried to force choke me.
Mark is peak human
Mark Hamill gets a free pass into Heaven.
Woah! Thats a reaaaallly spot on Mark Hammill
Mark Hammil (sp?) is my favorite part of the Star Wars universe. Just seems like a genuinely decent guy doing his best.
That dude couldn't be happier.  Give me more of this content
Looks like you signed lvc to me for Luke.  I like may the force be with you that was a very cool way of signing
Why he had to force choke me tho
That man continues to amaze me... he is one of the best humans I've ever seen...
Yes, definitely wholesome but did anyone else catch that he was using force choke?
Bro his little noise he made when Mark hugged him was of pure joy. I love it.
But after you learn ASL you hate travelling international, as everyone signs a different sign language from you :(
You Jedi mind tricks won’t work on me but that’s okay because your awesome and that works on me every time!
[deleted]
Man Mark Hammil is so cool
Well done. You are a credit to yourself and to the image of Luke Skywalker.
Cosplaying the heroism of Luke Skywalker and the kindness of Mark Hamill simultaneously is what I see. Thanks for being on the light side u/imflukeskywalker
Lovely to see,brought a tear to my eye! 
Legend !
That was legit
I'm not sure what the world has done to be blessed with Mark Hamill....
/r/wholesomecosplay
You’re such a sweet human being this made me tear up I’m sure this meant a lot to them :c
You are a king and I cried!
You are such a goddamned class act. Mad respect.
Next level. Jedi speak many languages.
I have always looked up to Luke Skywalker as a character growing up, he was my childhood hero.

As an adult I know that as great as Luke Skywalker is as a character the person I now admire most is Mark Hamill and his kind heart and generous soul. 

You are a class act and I am inspired by all that you do.

May The Force Be With You, Always.
He understands how impactful his actions are, 

Mark Hammond is fucking awesome.
I love Mark so much now.
Mark Hamill is a fucking amazing guy, and my favorite voice actor. His joker is iconic.
Legit thought you were Mark Hamill, OP. I commend you on both your kinrldness and your commitment to the Character! Well done on all fronts.
You are an amazing human being for doing this. Not only have you managed to spread a bit of love and happiness to Robert. You managing to stand next to Boba Fett without killing him for a second time. Absolutely inspiring post. Thank you so much
Just some more Jedi propaganda. 

You know, Vader used to visit kids at orphanage during his younger years. Well…just the one time…
 You were a role model for me when I was 5, and you're a role model for me at 43.
This might be up there with one of the most wholesome videos on Reddit
Hamil is a one of my favorite humans unironically. I'm a huge star wars fan, yeah. But you wouldn't know that unless it got brought up in conversation. I don't buy merch for stuff almost at all.       
       
But Mark goes out of his way to be an awesome person and be there for fans and kids a like. Dudes a real hero.      
       
Mark, if you see this, I'm a huge fan. I genuinely hope I can meet you one day just maybe get a signature for a poster or something. Star wars helped me bond with my dad, and helped me through some tough times. You were my hero as a kid, and now that I'm older, and see how awesome you are to people, your still my hero.
[deleted]
Mark is the best. Seriously the best.
Can confirm.
I know this will get buried, but I have a severe hearing loss and know ASL.  I volunteer with a charity that takes kids with disabilities, illnesses and social or emotional problems to Disneyland.  One year, I was paired with a young boy who is deaf.  We waited in line to see Donald Duck and get his autograph.  While waiting we were chatting in ASL about our day so far and what our favourite ride was.  When it was his turn, Donald tapped him on the shoulder and signed “you and me, friends”.  His face lit up and it brought tears to my eyes.  Disney truly is magical.
There's a sign for Jedi???
The fact that after all this insanely sweet and wholesome stuff Luke pulled the force choke pose for the picture was hilarious to me.
Thanks Fluke! Now I'm crying. Your love shines bright.
Wow didn’t even know you weren’t Mark until I checked the comments, great job with the look and I love the things your doing!
The hug made me tear.
I felt the human compassion.
Robert is my cousin how did this video already end up on the subject it just got posted to Facebook today. I know it really made him so happy,  Luke is up there with Mickey mouse and Santa for him. So amazing  to see. Lots of happy tears for the family.
Zach Galifianakis is a good Luke
I just love boba chilling out in the back
Is it dusty in here?
At first I thought that was really Mark Hamill! What a wonderful thing to do. 💕
Mark Hamil for president
My brother is special needs - born with Down Syndrome and a host of neurological and developmental disorders. These moments are beyond special to people like us; they are magical because we’re told not only do we belong in this space, we’re affirmed as just as worthy to share in these experiences.

Thank you for your kindness and may the force be with you always!
Mark Hamill is such a mensch
Mark Hamill, you are a national treasure. There’s a lot of people I looked up to as a little kid that turned out to be kinda crummy people, but man, every time I think to myself, “what’s Mark Hamill up to these days?” The answer is always “ahh, still being a very excellent person.”
Anyone else think it was Jack Black upon first viewing?
That is wonderful!  May the Force be with You!
Love you dude. Keep on rockin' in the free world.
What a kind person!
This is beautiful 😭 🧡
This made me cry.
“you are a jedi” 😭😭😭😭
You may not be the REAL Mark Hamil or an actual Jedi,

But you CERTAINLY have a Jedi's heart!

The force is with you
This is absolute humans being bros material. What a wonderful human being 💛
you are truly a legend and an inspiration for what you do, master fluke!
No, you're crying
Put this on /mademesmile
That is the most wholesome thing I've seen this year.
You really are a legend u/imflukeskywalker
It's too early for this stuff! 🥲
These creatures are not human; they are bloody angels that I want to hug all of them. IDK about the guy who is interacting with this angel, but god speed him.
If anyone can watch this and not smile I don't want to meet them.
Wow. Gave me happy goosebumps. This was so wonderful to watch.
thank you luke you’re my hero
We need more people like you in the world my guy awsome job.
The force is strong with you
Tears! Two true Jedi's!
I got bad wifi right now, is this actually mark hamill?
This was an amazing moment, sir!  Much props and respect to you!
i’d rather learn sign language. American doesn’t bring me that far
I came here to laugh, not to *FEEL!*
May the force be with you, Fluke. This is fantastic, thank you for being you!
This made my day. Thank you, Master Skywalker, please keep making a difference in the world :)
Tears to my eyes what a treasure
Goddamnit who is cutting onions so early in the morning
Always good to see you around Master Fluke Skywalker, you have taught us many thing and always been genearous with the ammount of questions you have been willing to answer
You got me again. Didn't realize it until I saw your username
That is an amazing thing to do. I am an English teacher in Singapore & our school banned singing happy birthday (covid rule). So I taught my classes how to sign it instead. I need to learn more.
This is what Star Wars is to me. Sharing joy and being awesome to one another.
Such a wholesome video. Props to you!
This needs to be on the front page
Someone's cutting onions 🥺
This was a very nice gesture. Mark Hamill is a great person.
Dude I am more impressed with Fluke every day.
that's really wholesome.
The force is definitely strong with this one.
This is so cool, we need more people like you my dude!
Damn.. Someone making bantha casserole? My eyes...
Where can one start learning ASL? Any recommendations?
Have you ever done any events for Lucasfilm? I know the Rebel Legion does events on their behalf sometimes, but have you ever had the chance to do bigger things, like film premieres, etc? You are one of the very few characters who looks perfect without a helmet on.  


Love from your local Vader! MTFBWY
now I’m even more mad at Disney for not making Luke’s story better
Actually fascinates me that sign language has dialects like spoken language does and there's a difference between ASL and BSL
Mark Hamill is fucking treasure.
Thank you again for what you do in the Cincinnati area you really do add to this city
Wait…. That isn’t even Mark Hamill?!?!

Either way, this video is unbelievable.
Omg this is incredibly amazing, and I always knew Luke was the best 😊
That is so awesome I learned ASL for work
This made my heart so happy. Not many people realize the impact of giving someone a few moments of joy.  It makes a huge difference in moral. Thanks for embodying Luke and spreading joy (and The Force)!
I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I am a big Mark Hamill fan.

He really seems like a good dude.
Oh my God, is the sign for "Jedi" pulling a hood up over your head? That's amazing, I love it.
What a fucking legend.
Yoda sign language??
What a fuckin amazing man!
Such a class act
I can’t believe that there is a sign for Jedi in ASL. I don’t know much about sign language but I figured that would be two specific to have it’s own sign.
Too great! You are a great person.
Fucking legend
class act all the way
Saying Jedi in sign language is cool as fuck.
That was fucking awesome!
You're what's right with the world man. Thank you for the smile.
Just when he couldn’t be anymore badass
So fucking amazing love this Guy
You're a badass Fluke, don't you ever stop that shit!
The best Jedi and the best Joker.
Mark for da win
Absolute chad
We don’t deserve mark
There’s a sign for jedi??
Good thing Boba had his helmet on, he doesn’t want a Jedi to see his tears.
Cannot stop watching, this is all i need to see for make my day a good day.
This is so freaking wholesome, I can't.
It's people like you that make the world a better place, Master Fluke.
Thanks for being inclusive and being a great role model in the cosplay community.
I'm not crying. You're crying
Well that's just neat. :)
I'm going to cry so hard the day we lose mark Hamill. An actual inspiration
Is been a long week for myself and probably longer for everyone else. 

This legit made me cry, thank you for all of your beauty.
 
May the Force be with you.
Damn got me tearing up right before work
Ok, this made me tear up. There are good people out their
Here I am, a welder. And I'm crying. Thank God I cry under my hood like the rest of the guys and gals. Right?
That's why he's the king....and you're a schmuck
I love the signing for "May the Force be with you."
This made my day
I. Actually took asl because my cousin is deaf and I felt terrible that no one in the family really talked to them. I tried writing with them at first, but decided that it really wasn't that much to ask to learn, even though they acted like it was okay.
My god I love Mark Hamill.
We will never actually deserve Mark Hammil.
There was a thread the other day about ["If lightsabers were real, who would be worth of one?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/t2k8cg/if_lightsabers_existed_which_nonfictional_person/)

I answered [Mr. Rogers](https://www.pbs.org/video/mister-rogers-goes-washington-ycjrnx/) but now I feel silly for leaving off the man himself, the actual Mark Hamill!

(This is him, right? Or a very, very talented cosplayer?)
This is amazing! Just a random fact. My mother works at a school for the deaf that is state funded. 99% of the parents at that school do not know sign language. They literally can’t communicate with their kids. Let that sink in. Also it is a state funded school that houses students during the week. Being state funded they have all of the same toiletries and food that a state prison gets.
Can someone please teach me how to sign - "May the Force be with you"?
Hes a GODDAMN TREASURE
Spoiler for the Hawkeye series.

>! I loved how Kingpin could sign to some extent, but still needed the translator because he couldn't read as fast as Maya was signing. That's how I read it anyway. Great touch! !<
This is a gentlemen in perfection. May the love be with you alltime and everywhere.
That’s so nice of him to take time out to do that,well played young Luke lol..
Why is Mark Hamil the absolute best celebrity. That dude is so nice and cool to all his fans
Mark Hamill is awesome.
This is Star Wars is and always will be, no matter what
Can we all appreciate the power stance that Luke does during the picture
Role. Model.
Damn Mark really be throwing up gang signs like a mad man s/
I'm not crying! You're crying!
He was my Uber driver one time. He’s all about helping out the kids. His Instagram is awesome and is always looking for people to donate. His Instagram is @1flukeskywalker. He inspired me after just one Uber ride. Incredible human.
When he spelled his name i thought a comet might come crushing down or something
I took ASL in college and the smiles I get when I'm able to communicate make the $600 I spent on the classes 100% worth it
I hope I don’t sound like the insensitive ass I used to be, but can anyone comment on how amazingly wonderful the idea of “the force” is for someone with a physical or sense-related limitation? (Sorry, if I’m being imprecise with my language.)
This was so wholesome , this is the best community I have ever been a part of ! No toxicity , no quarrels , just pure celebration of Star Wars and Extraordinary human kind
Tell me he didn’t do it for money
Is nobody noticing the bounty hunter in the background?!

Hrumph...he's no Jedi.
Freaking awesome - faith restored
I’m not crying…
This is the way.
Boba Fett? Boba Fett?!?
Now I know how to sign ‘Jedi’ with the hood up.
It really made me smile💖
Mark Hamill always has been and always will be one of life’s rare and truly good human beings.
aww
Today I learned the sigh for Jedi.
After spending my time sucked into the Ukraine vs Russia news, this was like a breath of fresh air.
Give him all the blue milk he wants! Or else Boba will hunt you down.  Preferably bring in the blue milk cold, not warm...:)
Fluke, you are a wonderful human being. May the Force be with you! 😊
He seems to know it pretty well.
You're a good guy, Fluke.
the ASL sign for Jedi is pulling a hood over your head?

that's fuckin awesome.
The man. The myth. The fucking legend
This is so great! Thank you for sharing this.
Yo the ASL for "jedi" is "put your hood up"? That's amazing lmao
Mark Hamill is the best. Thx Luke for being the best of the force. Hugs
This should be the definition of wholesome
Very awesome
Mark Hammill's entire existence is making peoples day.
Could Mark Hamill be any more god damn wholesome??
Damn. That was something. I liked Mark Hamill, but now I really like Mark Hamill.

He’s a huge celebrity. He could give zero fucks because money allows people that cold indifference to others (not saying all the wealthy are like this but the cliche of the heartless rich is nothing new) but this clearly demonstrates empathy and caring and time and devotion.
My son is learning BSL currently and he loves everything star wars. Can’t wait to show him this!
I remember signing to my cousin's wife during their wedding and it was so awesome to see how they both lit up when I started signing horribly.
I hope he never dies
This is incredibly wholesome. Thank you for sharing!!
He's such an amazing person
Good guy mark ham--- wait
I always get a bit emotional whenever the line "may the force be with you" is said. This one made me happy cry legit, that is luke m.f.ing SKYWALKER. Signing that shiz in asl, I would be balling my eyes out if that were in front of me
Love me some star wars. May the force be with you all.
Good man
r/mademesmile
Did I cry? I did. This is beautiful.
Hamill is among the best
Mark Hamill is literally the most amazing person ever. I hope I have the chance to meet him someday.
That was freaking amazing. God bless your soul. You made his day and definitely made mine too. It's great to see things like this. Great job on bringing a smile to a star wars fan. May the force be with you!
Yo the ASL sign for Jedi is so cool! Is that an invented sign or is it standard?
That's material for r/mademesmile because it did made me smile :-)
Onions! Everwhere cutted onions! Who's doing that?
Class act, I am learning British sign language at the moment and seeing moments like this brings me joy.

Awesome stuff, may the force be with you,
Man I hope Mark sees this. The fact that so many think it's him speaks to his character as well, knowing he would totally do the same for fans.
Dude, Fluke, I just want to say thank you so much for what you do. You are so wholesome and you bring joy to so many people!!
Mark Hamill just became one of my favourite people in the world.
I want to start off with agreeing that I initially thought this was actually Mark Hamill, you are an excellent cosplayer/doppleganger! And also it is super amazing that you taught yourself ASL to be more accessible to fans!

But I decided to comment because I rewatched the last few seconds a few times because your last "thank you" looks like the improper use that is "f*ck you"? I don't personally know ASL but I've seen several graphics about how people will make mistakes when signing. Maybe it's because of your beard? I'm sure that if I'm right, they thought it was a simple mistake as it's probably common. Hopefully a more expert ASL user can weigh in.
Did you notice how Mark force chocked the cameraman? Curious
[deleted]
Mark Hamill seems like one of the coolest humans ever
I'm an ASL student and this made my morning.
I have a friend fluent in ASL. While we were talking to a person in the office of our apartment complex a lady walked in looking to pick up a package left for her. I still don't quite know how he knew but my friend started to sign to her. Her face absolutely lit up. Ill never forget it because I could remember how happy she looked. After she left the person in the office said they never realized the woman had a hearing impairment and thought she was just quiet.
You are right! I started to learn a few years back but got sidetracked and stopped.  I will start again today.
So nice to see someone who gives a shit about his fans. What a stand up guy.
Will somebody please stop cutting onions in here? Thanks OP, I really needed to see some kindness today.
I love that you can sign Jedi in ASL: lift a hood over your head.
Mark Hamill is awesome
That was very fucking cool. Keep up the excellent work.
You look just like him. Has he ever met you?
This is amazing. 🤍
Who the fuck is cutting onions in here??
Such a stud
I am certain this will get buried, but I can't thank you enough for doing what you do. You are a hero in Jedi's clothing and I admire you so, so much. All my love and wishes for a happy, healthy future to you and yours. Be safe, be blessed. ❤️
You’re just really cool! Love your posts!
That was amazing. Thank you for being awesome
Luke proving he's still everyone's hero
Mark Hamill is awesome!
Very cool, you made that man's day.👍👏👏👏
TIL Mark Hamill is The Best

Mark Hamill truly is a gift. His compassion and understanding of how his role as Luke and Star Wars in general means a lot more to people then just movies is a beautiful light in this rather dark world. He truly cares and goes above and beyond.
I wonder how far he had to travel for the visit and when this was. Really touching.
I bet Mark Hamill is the kind of guy that when he was coming up in his career he said to himself that if he ever got really famous he would be super generous to fans and actually followed through on it.
The world doesn’t deserve Mark Hamill. 
Mark Motherfuckin' Hamill: all around nice guy and best damn Joker voice ever.
The true Last Jedi.
What makes it so much better is how humble he is about it.  He never publicises this stuff, so he obviously does out for nothing other than kindness. I’m so glad he’s getting another big burst of popularity, he deserves it more than anyone
...grok?
Humility goes a long way. There are a lot of celebrities out there who are so far up their own asses and couldn't give a shit. They may even pretend to care, but they don't. With Mark Hamill you know it's genuine and that he's a real down to earth guy.
He was such a beautiful person... before he turned to the dark side in 10 days. Get hype!
Shit...now I'm crying. 

Hey /u/cameruso,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Twitter is the worst way to deliver any actual information
Twitter is such a great place for sharing long stories...

But yes, Mark Hamill is the best. Why did it take some of you moofmilkers this long to realise that?!
I’m so relieved to see this story and not another Hollywood sex scandal story. This made my day so much better. 
I was in LA once and happened upon a comic book shop that had Matt Groening and Mark Hamill signing treehouse of horror comics. It was supposed to end at a decent hour but the shop had miscalculated when they stopped letting people in line and it was going well into the evening. Around 7 Mark Hamill has to leave but instead of just taking off he got up and walked down the line to make sure he not only signed something for everyone but also took a few seconds to talk to them. He was a super nice guy. 
There's a group of Hollywood celebs that managed to get rich and famous, yet didn't let mess with their head. Mark's one of them.
Numerous women have come forward and accused Mark Hammill of touching their hearts. 
Above and beyond just to give a child one last memory. 
The hero we need...but not the one we deserve...
Also credit to the agent that actually followed through and told Mark--even if begrudgingly!
Mark is a national treasure. He has the ability to step back and examine his role in star wars from all angles. He can be super serious about the character and what Luke means to the fans while also being an incredibly light hearted troll who pokes fun at the lore and our rabid obsessions. He truly understand how to balance the Force. 
He was my hero when I was a kid. He still is, but he used to be too.
Kind of crapping on the agent who made the call to Mark immediately and relayed the info properly enough to get him involved...

You know, if Mark called back in 90 seconds.
When I was very young, Mark Hamill came to the town that I live in to visit an old historic Hamill family estate. I met him at the market with my mom, he was drunk as hell and wearing a stained white T-shirt. Fucker wouldn't sign my VHS. I still like him.
Lets make Mark Hamil king of earth. He blew up the death star, defeated the dark side,  helped kids and provided us with joker dubs of donald trumps twitter. He deserves to be king. Or atleast give him some kinda medal. Op take my upvote. 
I think in reality it's Luke playing Mark Hamill
We don’t deserve Mark Hamill.
Can Mark Hamill be president? Like seriously, if we have current politicians being the way they are now, how is he worse?

"Well he's not qualified."
And the current one is?

Hamill is at least compassionate and wants to bring positivity to the world. He also strikes me as the kind of guy to be humble enough to know he doesn't know everything, and would surround himself with people that are very qualified for an administration's positions.

Honestly, I would take a kind and humble person as president over an experienced career politician who's a sellout any day.
Upvoting this post is cool but here's the actual twitter thread, if you want to give points/support there: https://twitter.com/ed_solomon/status/937717304141471744
There's nothing like learning that the man who played your fictional heroes as a child turned out to be someone you can admire as an adult. It's like "yeah, Luke's not a real person," but Mark Hamill is a 100% good person, and while you can't grow up to swing a lightsaber, he's someone you can look up to and be inspired by. 
Got teary eyed! Poor kid, poor family! Props to Mark
We need to find out what Mark Hamill likes and we'll all do it
[deleted]
I hope Mark lives another 100 years.
I'm not crying.
You're crying.
Shut up.
Mark is amazing, he’s one of us, the fame hasn’t gotten to his head, he’s humble. 
I'm not crying, you're crying :'(
If you just learned that today, you haven’t been paying attention. Mark Hamill is a national treasure. Not even overstating things.
That's really nice. It's really nice of Mark to do these kinds of things, but it must also be a great feeling: being able to comfort someone like that. 
That's cute. Masha'Allah. 
Damn these pregnancy hormones! Why is it raining from my eyes???
We don't deserve him.
Beautiful. My opinion of Hamill continues to rise every time I learn more about him or hear of compassionate or funny things he's done. Also TIL what "grok" means, indirectly b/c of Hamill. 
Which one of you jerks figured out how to cut onions through my work computer's screen???
Can we make him into a saint already?
Mark Hamill will never die. He will only become one with the force that is our hearts.
Lovely story. Now if only I could get Daisy Ridley to meet me in character...
Too bad Rian doesn’t feel the same way. 
Mark Hamill is a world treasure!
cutting onions, someone is
Ed Solomon being the dude who wrote Men in Black and Bill and Ted. And was the namesake for Chuck De Nomolos, the evil sit up champion of the 27th century. 
Mark Hamill is one of the greatest human beings ~~on the planet~~ in the galaxy.
TIL the word "grok"
The dude is literally an inspiration to a few generations. When I see his smile and love for what he does it brings joy to me.  What a great guy.
r/humansbeingbros
oh
The world is a better place with you, /u/RealMarkHamill.
Why do I always end up
Reading this stuff when I have dust in my eyes?
This might be the first time I've ever heard someone outside family reference Stranger in a Strange Land. Nice.
Fucker. That hit me right in the feels. 
What a wonderful human being :) 
Phones screen broke, maybe for the better.

An elegant solution for a more civilized age.
Is it legal?
A broken screen to be sure, but a welcome one
THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE LEMONADE FROM LEMONS, FOLKS
It looks like your phone is powered with a nuclear rod... you might want to get a caner check...
This is the sickest thing I have ever seen
“Modern problems require modern solutions”
I'm gonna break my phone so I can do this.
Ayyyyyyyyy! Mine did that last September in the exact same spot! It gets really annoying after a while. Line is too bright.
Mine does the same thing but with a purple line.
That is a sick *screen saber*
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Screen the Broke?
Green is the color of a consular. Even your cellphone has a higher rank than Anakin.
The force was too strong with this one...
May the Force be with you. Always.
Kinda makes me want to throw my phone off a very high place.
This is the way
Wow, that's awesome.
Damn son that's ph fresh! Smack my phone and spill coffee on it !!!
I'd keep that phone forever, lol.
This same thing with the green color happened to my friend's phone
I love this
The force is with you Young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.
You'll be  using Mace Windu when it turns purple.
Damn that's cool! better get a Qui-gon image as well :)
is it possible to learn of this power?
Ah yes a man of quality I see.
That's actually super awesome!!😂 And if it still works, hey.
This is amazing.
Honestly way to make the best of a bad situation lol. I’d still be mad but not *as* mad
I want my phone to break like this now
So this is how this screen dies...with thunderous applause
This is the way
This is the way
OP did sand cause the damage?  I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere...
This is the way.
Whyndid I think that was a light saber for a second?
MOdern Problems Require Modern Solutions
200,000 upvotes are ready with a million more well on the way
Kintsugi implemented perfectly.
Mine did this from dropping it.  I took it into the Apple store and they fixed it
FYI, Apple replaced my screen for free, out of warranty, when something similar showed up on my phone. My screen also went from showing an issue to completely dead in a couple hours.
Brb gonna drop my phone off the overpass down the street.
Forgot green savers exist. Cause the sequels did
Great, now every porn will be Star Wars themed!
Jedi business go back to your iPhones
I’m not even a star war fan but I have that for a wallpaper if my phone screen are broken like that
You know what they say.. when life gives you lemons make lemonade
I see this happening a lot on iPhones. Is it a known defect?
Can someone explain why this green/purple defect most of the time happens at this same spot?
Alright now I wanna break my phone, I wonder if I do it right if I can get blue or red too? Who knows I might wanna switch the Jedi out
In need of repair, you are.
Damn mine did the exact same today, big green line in the exact same spot but sadly the rest is just black
I have the same thing on mine.... just purple.
Make sure you don’t press hard on it like I did
You figured this out at 4:20 didn’t you? 😂
You are strong and wise, Anakin and I am very proud of you
K I’m going to go break my phone now
BRUHHHH WHAT THE FUCK. I WAS LOOKING AT THIS POST WHILE I WAS PUTTING MY SHOE ON AND MY PHONE DROPPED AND SCREEN IS CRACKED
Are you selling it?
genius
Can you make a tutorial on how to break screens
Lemons = Lemonade
Nice screen saber!
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
Can anybody explain how to do that?
modern problems require modern solutions
I wouldn't even fix this phone. I fixed a purple line on my last phone and I'm kicking myself for it now. Could've rocked mace
My phone is cracked AF, today.

IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.
Dude, this is so sick. Take my gold.
Feature*
Screen is broken, it is not.
It’s actually an easy fix. Apple did mine for free even though I dropped it. Something do with the the LEDs underneath coming lose. Could be wrong though.
Yes, but bad that screen broke tho
Would you luke at that!
Luke's beautiful Green Lightsaber deserved better respect in the Sequel Trilogy😠
Damn
This is the way.
great idea!
Its evolution but just backwards
That's a feature!
Damn, we just *thought* we were down to the last Jedi.
LCD gang
This just happened to me yesterday! I was in a rage so thanks for making me feel better about it!
Alright, that’s pretty cool.
Tactical baby yoda for extra karma
Unknown to OP, he now only has reception on high ground.
Image link?
That is AMAZING
better mount cooling jets on the sides so it doesn't explode.
Bravo!
Not maybe, definitely
I really want to know the physics that were involved in this. You didn’t break your phone bro, you got a free upgrade.
Damn I have 2 thin green lines on the right of my s7 edge
You are strong and wise, and I’m very proud of you
Woah!
how tfffff
Must do wonders for your battery
that might have been how the green got like that

Hey /u/MotherOfAnOP,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.

How do I break my phone like this..

Modern problems require modern solutions
I wouldn't have thought of that. Genius.
Brb trying to break my phone
did you have to crop the wallpaper to fit the line?
Be right back going to go crack my phone.
This so 🧐 sophisticated!!!!!
The force is strong in this one
I think your phone is worth more now. That’s sick!
It's not going to stay like that forever. It's going to die for real in a couple days / weeks.
I see you've constructed a new screen saber. Your skills are complete.
Apple should warranty that. Its a known issue. I believe up to three years.
The ol' Motorola green line...
I see you have constructed a new wallpaper. Your skills are complete, indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen.
I had this problem with iPhone X and my screen completely died within few days. Go to apple store ASAP and get this fixed!!!!!!
You have become more powerful then any Jedi has ever dreamed of
The force flows strong with this one
Modern problems require modern solutions
The force is strong in my family. My father has it, I have it, and...my phone has it.
But the meme says that's a Samsung
That sucks and at the same time it’s so cool!
The force is strong with this one (sorry, had to)
Never fix it
I had that same issue, I took it to Apple and they replaced my phone for free. They said it’s a backlight issue and not my fault.
I have a pink line on mine! Can't do something as cool as that.
Chapeau 🎩
My iPhone XS did this too!
Bruh I will throw my phone right now to get that.
Did mods use CSS to break the left side of this post?

If yes, make it green.

Edit: Nah it seems like it's just some weird interaction between Firefox and RES on desktop. An element overlaps comments on left side for me on video posts.
Ok so how did you break it.
It didn't break, it became a Jedi
Dont ever fix this
Feature this is, not a screen broken!
This is the way
screen saber?
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber, your skills are complete.
The Force is strong with this iPhone
Nice screen saber!
Same thing happened to me when it was over 100 degrees but it’s fine now, do you live in a hot weather op?
OP FYI this is a common problem, Apple should fix for free
This is so fucking good
Apple just gave me a new phone for free because of this issue. Just go to an Apple Store
r/UnexpectedLightsaber
Can you share a link to that baby yoda wallpaper? I can’t find film-shot that fit a phone layout.
Damn, can I get a tutorial on how to break my phone like yours?
One of my favorite things about the Mandalorian was that we finally had a star wars product without a lightsaber needlessly jammed in there somewhere.

Didn't last long...
[Obi Wan has taught you well](https://youtu.be/exR2VLmzeT4)
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
Cool factor aside, assuming you had that as your wallpaper before, I wonder if the color of the line was influenced by what colors the pixels were set to when the screen broke.
Oh yours just started. Mine has been growing in width by about 1 pixel per month for about 2 years. Now I've got a giant pink line down my phone. I've gotten into the subconscious habit of moving photos around on my screen to see the whole thing.
... ya know the Death Star throne room pls
idk if you want to get it fixed but something almost identical happened to my phone and they fixed it at the apple store for free
Sell it on ebay, make money before it dies
The other background should be a tie fighter flying upward, shooting.
One does not find joy in a broken screen, but this... Does bring a smile to my face
How do I break my phone to be like yours?
It’s an old screen, but it checks out.
Light saber was my first thought. Awesome.
It would also be cool to have a phone that isn't broken.
PUSHEWWWW
How many people are about to break the fuck out of their phones trying to recreate this?
I just wanted to say that I double checked and all the references to SW were already made at least twice on Reddit. That’s including this thread.
MY SCREEN IS BROKEN IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE
Ugggh I have the same bad screen but the green line is directly along the edge
Must suck checking it at night though.
How does a green or white line like that produce such a perfect lightsaber-like glow? It doesn't seem natural
You got that idea 6 minutes before didn't you
A thousand generations of Jedi live in your iPhone now.
Hard not to call fake. As in you broke it purposely or it’s just fake.
Should've done six minutes earlier!!
Could you have done this 6 mins earlier? I really thought you'd 4:20-ed us too
Mine did that... Fuck it hurt eyes when I couldn't sleep and browse Reddit at 2am...
6 minutes earlier would have been 10/10 post
Is there a way to make your phone make the sound of a light saber powering on whenever your phone wakes up?
Hahaha super clever I love it !
*He can't do that!*
The force (it took to break that screen) is strong in you.
This is the way.

I have spoken.
Whoa how did you get the iPhone Star Wars edition? I thought they sold out!
Doesn’t this happen on Androids tho?
I've seen that happen a few times, it it just broken at that point? Screen replacement and that's it.
Maybe?
u/vredditdownloader
You didn’t just break your screen, but the screewomeen and screechildreen too.
You’re just a boy...
This is so funny I’m LAUGHING
The force is strong with this one
i wonder if there’s a mace windu for the purple lines
I mean.... You can do that with a normal screen, too ;)
Ecks dee
Love this
Hahaha dumb ass. Wait...
Brruhhhhh
Definitely for the better.
Why is it so fucking bright
If it’s an iPhone X. It’s a common problem with the display take it to apple store and it will get replaced for free if no other damage. Or leave it because it’s awesome. May the force be with you
If my phone is gonna break, break like this.
This is the way.
i actually had the exact same problem... if you want it fixed you can for either free or very cheap since there are no exterior cracks
Is it possible to learn this power?
*Immediately throws phones against a wall*
It's a feature
It's obviously broken.  The clock is 6 minutes fast.
When life gives you lemons!
I was literally actually kinda like “omg” when I first this, but it totally made me lol after that. Great post
So sad I don't have this
Yeah mine was pink
My buddy's screen has the exact same thing
Fuck how do I break my phone
This is the way.
Big PP energy.
Don't know how you can use that with that glare tho
[](https://i.imgur.com/piKBslz.jpg)

I must be on the dark side.
I need this wallpaper but mirrored. Friend of mine has the same problem and I always call their phone the lightsaber phone
Okay so what do I need to do.
Good!
Nah I’m always stoked for Star Wars.
Do you go to ASU because you're number 1 in Innovation!
6 minutes late for extra karma
Mines purple! And I hate that I never thought of this.
How do you unlock it without swiping up?
Most impressive.
Maybe it wouldn't be broken if you weren't always turning it on and off.
Strange, people always made it seem like iPhones are indestructible and absolutely perfect. I guess this proves it?
this is the way
Well Played
I’ve never seen a more appropriate time to link to r/NeverTellMeTheOdds
I consider this an absolute win!
I need that lol
When life gives you lemons
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week.
There goes my upvote!
Lines up so well. Hope it's not battery intensive
u/VredditDownloader
It took me a little more than 2 days, but I’m finally done!!!

Your star destroyer is most impressive you must be very proud.
In Homecoming Peter made a Death Star,

In Home Isolation Miles made a Star Destroyer.
That's bonkers.

How many pieces is that?
That's awesome! But real talk where did you get that spiderman jacket
Holy crap dude that’s awesome. I didn’t even notice the corvette until I zoomed in!
If some of you want the dimensions

Length: 109 cm/43 in.
Height: 44 cm/ 17 in.
Width: 65 cm / 26 in.

So yeah, it’s a massive piece.
This is sexy.
That’s the easy part, the trick is finding somewhere to display it.

(I speak from experience, having had to move several times since first building this exact model)
Now build one more, then a hammerhead corvette, and recreate the Scariff scene when the star destroyers crashed into each other!
Read the title... first thing that came to mind is " Wow, this guy is an absolute fucking machine; that's a crazy amount of work "  


Then i looked at the username  [u/blackmachine312](https://www.reddit.com/user/blackmachine312/)  


Well done man, well done!

[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/g9wk89/it_took_me_a_little_more_than_2_days_but_im/)
I dreamed of having this kit as a kid, I had a LEGO magazine subscription and would drool over it every time it was featured!
Your smile makes the pic, bud!

Must have taken a lot of work.  Too bad our Y-Wings will bomb it back to Coruscant!
Ur smile is contagious bro
Ive never seen such a big smile like that. And its deserved that you smile like that. 2 days only to make that ship man i would have been making that thing for 3 months or so
Building that in 2 days is proper impressive! Well done mate
Next is a life sized version
I want one of these giant Star Destroyers so fucking bad but I don’t have the room or the money for one.
I know this is the Star Wars sub, but nobody going to comment on how dope that Spider-man hoodie is? That's awesome as all get out! Where's it from?

The ship is pretty friggin sweet too.
2 days?! That would have taken me 2 months... awesome dude, well done.
Only 2 days?!? Holy crap that looks like it would take the rest of quarantine for me to complete!
i had one as a kid. my mom "split" it in two right before i finished it and put it away in my lego box along with all the loose pieces. I have never cried so hard in my life.
Can’t tell if that’s a huge Lego build, or if you’re just a little short for a stormtrooper.
That’s badass! I am not confident in that small table holding it though. Lol
Looks like you built an Imperial Starship, not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
I really like your table... but seriously that's amazing
Very nice, I’m 57 and love Legos have been a few sets over my time, Christmas was the best time when the kids were young and building the Star Wars sets with them, my 20 year old son got a special edition set this past Christmas
I can't tell whats better the lego set or the pure joy he has for creating it
Love it! I would advise adding some additional support in the front. After a couple months it will start to droop
That’s a sick hoodie
2 days?!?! That’s incredible. That would take me at least two weeks
Another Star Destroyer joins the ever growing fleet of our Empire. Your hard work is appreciated
That will make a fine addition to your collection.
Legend
You put more effort into Star Wars than the writers of the last trilogy
you should put that little ship (forget the name) jammed into the side of the Star Destroyer like in Rogue One
building it on that table must have been a nightmare
Did it take you 3 days?

But seriously holy cow that build is amazing!
This is wholesome
Just don't let Harrison Ford anywhere near that.
Your coffee table is really cool.
I don’t understand how it’s possible to maintain such a level of patience...

Well done!
Bruh 2 days??? You must not have videogames or any distractions. Haha that’s awesome, maybe I can beat your time but I going to need to get some money and some ultimate focus first.
1. That’s EPIC
2. How much did it cost?
3. Where can I buy one?
The look of accomplishment.
Is that table made of legos too?
At first glance the table almost looks like Lego too!
Nice work! I really miss building Lego’s. maybe I should buy some used set and give it a go once again. Love them technical sets.

Nice job! Awesome hoodie too, I love that
Damn this has been my dream Lego sets since it was released
A big ass star destroyer in 2 days? The force is definitely with you my friend
[deleted]
The look on your face says it all my friend...   More than any of us can put in to words
That’s so awesome. Never too old
#they weren’t expecting special forces
Can I come over and play with it?
What I can really relate to.., is the smile on your face. 

My dream is the Voltron set. Or the Bowser replication I've seen on bricklink or such site. Not today, but someday I'll be able to buy it.

Congrats man!!! Seriously!!

Now break it up, and see how many other Lego models you can recreate in 'Nouveau Gray'.
Dang dude - quarantine well spent right there
I remember years ago when I was like 12ish, for Christmas I got the Star Destroyer set that was smaller than this but still pretty huge for a Lego set. I spent the next week during Christmas break coming in and building that things a few hours a day and then when I got bored, I'd go downstairs and play my brand new copy of The Force Unleashed on the Wii. That was a such a great game, and I still have my fully assembled Star Destroyer. Came with a Darth Vader, Tarkin, some Royal Guards, and a couple stormtroopers IIRC.
I really like your smile and how happy you look. I bet it felt rewarding to have finished that.
I had no idea those were that massive. Nicely done dude!
Congrats dude! You look so happy, and rightfully so!
That is the face of a very happy man!
Amazing!
Damn that looks like fun.
This dudes smile just made my day.
You know what? Good job, mate. That took some time and effort.
Shit, I thought that table was made out of Legos for a minute! I was like "damn!!"
It brings a tear to my eyes. It’s so beautiful!
Cool hoodie and damn I had no idea it was so huge
by 2 days 2 u mean the whole 48 hours?
I like the hoodie man, also good job
I just like that huge proud smile, made me feel a bit happy myself on the accomplishment
Fuck yes
Next build a larger table.
Man for a second I thought that you made the table out of legos too!
Wow man amazing work!  had this set when I was a kid but my then step-dad threw it out as a punishment... Wish I could get another sometime soon!
Two days?.. I'm still looking at a box of Legos from nine years ago
That thing is massive dude! Also, I like the jacket.
How's the fingers?  Raw as hell?  I built the Overwatch Gibraltar set and maaaaaan it almost killed me.
I thought that table was also made of LEGO
Nice job but there was absolutely no sleep in that 48 hours
This is fucking badass
Your smile is amazing, comrade, you're amazing :)
He even made the small Alderanian ship from Episode Five!
Whered u get the sweater??
Congrats
You have a wonderful smile!
Sweet build!!!

Can I ask where you got your hoodie at? I dig it.
DOPE AF 🙌🏽
That’s a UCS Star Destroyer right? God damn, that’s beautiful.
That's awesome!! I like how happy you look haha :D
Damn I sleep next to one of these every night but seeing this pic made me really check mine out for the first time in years. Such a sick build, but yes - as some previous comments have pointed out, it could benefit from additional supports. The nose sags a bit over time and the bottom panels don’t stay attached at the back by the engines very well.
Bruh how is that JUST two days?? That looks like so much more time!
two days??? dude! you're amazing, that looks so cool!
Makes me nervous just looking at that. Especially after seeing Dude Perfect's video where they destroy one of these and and Spiderman: Homecoming when Ned drops the Death Star.
Dude, that's almost as amazing as that dope-ass Miles Morales hoodie!!!!
I prefer the "Venetor-class republic attack cruiser"
The look of accomplishment.
I’m so happy for you!
Awesome set and great hoody!
Do not invite Harrison Ford!
Now don’t drop it....
Better hope starkiller doesn’t see it
It’s beautiful.
What an absolute unit. Very jealous. Now go get those death star plans!
Dude Perfect built that. And then they destroyed it
What an absolute unit. Props my man big props
GOOD, GOOOOOOOD. THE EMPIRE SHALL RULE UNOPPOSED
Watch out for the rage monster
I always tell people you’re never too old for legos!
Lord Vader will be pleased
What is the name of that specific LEGO ship? Links I keep finding seem like smaller versions of one in photo
My guy!!! That's so dope!
Where'd you get that hoodie too?  I likes
That's amazing, how did you accomplish that in just two days?
I would have HOURS of fun per day carrying this around my house while making mouth generated sound effects and spouting dialouge.
Only during Corona can you believably say you built that in two days lol
Thats a face of pure happiness... i love this picture 👍👌
Your happiness is infectious
Awesome! This brings me joy. Thanks for sharing!
Don't ever show that to Harrison Ford...
this post or r/lego is the one after this on my feed, anyway great job!
Very impressive.
Dood dope! I've always wanted to do a star destroyer!
Great job. Good choice of hoodie as well.
The quarantine is strong with this one
I don't know why but it makes me really happy seeing you that happy
it makes me happy how happy he is
2 days is really fast, gj
Don't. Drop. It.
Uses Jedi mind trick: you will send it to me
nice lando
The real question is where are you going to put it??
Damn! I want a full size lego man that displays your lego star destroyer while sitting on your couch! How long to assemble the human part?
And you didn't wait five days to post this so you can post on 5/4...why? Just missed opportunities!
Woah.
Such an awesome set, and that really puts it to scale. Hope you enjoyed building!
Huge fish bruv
Impressive...most impressive.
Impressive......Most Impressive
[deleted]
Impressive. Most impressive
Only two days? That’s pretty fast
Oh it's beautiful
That's badass! Cool to see it put together!!  I'm so jealous. My work-from-home setup is currently occupying my Lego building space, so mine is still sitting in its box... :(

Thank you, sir! I need to make better life choices.
[deleted]
We will monitor your [Lego] career with great interest.
I intentionally took a week on it to savor the building process.
(ﾉ*0*)ﾉ
it looks so good, and nice smile btw :)
You look like a proud father with his new child, love it!
That's awesome! The trick is gonna be moving it to the final viewing spot.
I like your hoodie !
Congrats! And love the hoodie btw!
2 days? That would have take me 2 years. Nice one.
Thats bad ass my man
Two regular days or two quarantine days?
So how are your fingertips feeling after all that?
People can do in 2 days what I can do in 17 years? Holy fuck that explains a lot...
You are strong and wise and we are very proud of you.
How thick is the instruction manual for that thing??
My man!
This brings me great joy
Did you move it and keep it together or take it apart after ?
Awesome but where are you gonna put it buddyo
Epic
I bet the elation of putting on the final piece was glorious.
That’s a sweet hoodie
What are you planning on doing with it now? Its friggin awesome by the way!
That cost more than your couch.  I bet. .
I love LEGO
Beautiful. If I had 849.99 to Spare I would have one of them in a heartbeat man.  Especially during these bogus times. Lol.
I look forward to seeing you on Lego Masters season 2
Is that table made of lego too??

Edit: typo
Its a beautiful table
Nice, dude! That thing looks slick.
2 days would’ve taken me 2 years
I BUILT THE SAME DAMN THING AND IT TOOK ME WEEKS
I thought the table was Lego too
Every time i see this set displayed I replayed the day I finished it and one of the legs of the Table I built it on folded and it shattered.
how many times did you think a little square on the table was a lego?
Ok now I’m going to go play LEGO Star Wars
In a palpatine voice: push it
Good work Miles Morales
Nice job looks sick
[deleted]
Mind telling me the exact set model pls?
Only 2 days! Congrats bro!!!
How much did that set cost?
Pull up a Hammerhead Corvette I have an idea!
The pure joy. The accomplishment. Lego.
2 days, I will hire you
Me - **Remembers Dude Perfect video and cries*
How do I convince my wife to let me get this? Been asking for years. I want to encase it in some kind of glass container and use it as a coffee table or something. It would be awesome but the wife doesn't see the value :(
That couch looks comfy as hell
Looks so fun to build. As a 36 year old man I really should just cave in and build Legos as a hobby. I mean sure I have kids but I want Legos for me, darnit!
Fuck yeah man congrats
Amazing!
I’ve always wanted one too. But what do you do with it once it’s built? Do you take it apart or display it?
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Did you do the table too?
Where did you put it?
How much was that kit? The thought scared me lol
Woah nice work dude! Now you have a new objective: keep it away from people so they dont break it
damn my guy
Ironically, by building a star destroyer, he created a star; himself. May the force be with you, always.
That looks so hard cos all the pieces are gray
I see you've constructed a new star destroyer. Your skills are complete.
[deleted]
that is fucking cool, the jacket is also fucking amazing
2 days thats awesome, any sleep in that time?
Awesome dude, never had that one. Looks amazing!
Next post: ” It took me a week but I build a full scale functional one”
[deleted]
i’ve never wanted to hang out with someone more in my life
You see, I'd love to build one of these but I wouldn't want to keep it nor would I even have the space to. The building part is fun still as an adult, but the reason to keep it has diminished.
Wow! That would’ve taken me weeks! Congrats
so happy! :D love it
Awesome dude!!!
SO NUTS!
That’s awesome. ISD’s are the best.
Two days is lightning fast for a set that big.
I can’t wait to get that set! I’m saving up for it!
Side note: that sweatshirt is sweet!
I thought your table was made of lego at first :).   Awesome build!
Awesome! But I think you may need a bigger table
Werd to the Nerd
Did you take any breaks?! My husband built his over a week. A few hours every night. Most impressive.
What are you thoughts on suspending that in epoxy with star fighters and asteroids, make like a battle scene.
How much is that set?!?!?
King
that thing is huuuuuge.

2 days feels like an achievement and a half, well done.
Nice jacket
Good looks my guy.
How heavy is that thing? Is it hollow on the inside or solid LEGO?
I absolutely love his smile, that's a proud smile.
Is that an extra piece on the carpet?
I wish i had legos, nice job 👍
YES! That’s awesome dude! Congrats.
Whoa man! Totally jealous here! Nice build!
Nice! Where u gonna put it?
It was one of my favorite builds I’m glad you like it!
When I was 12, I got one of those foam 3D puzzles of an Imperial Star Destroyer. The only part I finished was the thrusters on the very back. Every other part looked exactly the same.

Well done, dude.
That table gives me a bad feeling.
That would take me 2 decades
I'd love to build this but I wouldn't know where to put it lol
I’ve seen this raw strength only once before
Lego is so fuckin wholesome. Nice work!
Your smile bought a smile to my face. Well done!
That smile says it all, great work!
Username doesn't check out, you're a human bro!
Your star destroyer is very impressive, you must be proud.
I'm not much of a star wars fan, but I love seeing people finish things that they obviously care about. The smile on your face says it all!  Kudos to you.
Tell me why I thought you were talking about building the table as I was scrolling by? 

NVM, don’t. Great job, patience is a virtue and your smile says everything.
Awesome!
Protect that thing man, don’t let any harm come to it.

2 quarantine days? That’s like 40 regular says
$1,000,000 worth of LEGO I bet
It’s... beautiful
Wishing I had the $800 to afford it.
The force is strong with this one
[deleted]
You should watch the Dude Perfect “Quarantine Stereotypes” video lol. It’s their most recent video I think.

I saw it today and well.... you’ll see what happens about halfway through. It might pain you to see that.
Doing self-quarantining right my friend!
Sick!!! I’ve always wanted to build the old school Death Star II that was released years ago but it goes for sooooo much online lol
Nice!
I just like the table.
damn i’ve wanted that set for so long
Anybody wanna buy me one
Goddamn dude.  Don’t drop it
Miles?
This is the first thing ill buy when im done with college. You sir just made me really jealous
I love it and wish I had one.
First batch of the day!
Death Star next
You should call Harrison Ford
Awesome!!
Thats awesome!
Nicely done Sir!!!
That thing in awesome!
The guy she tells you not to worry about:

You: https://lego.brickinstructions.com/06000/6801/main.jpg
You, my dear....are gorgeous with that beautiful smile! Happy you completed this Lego...Never too old to accomplish more Lego builds. Keep us updated!
Eric Foreman would be proud...Great job man
Now pick it up!
Whoa man, that’s so cool! I’m a bit jealous 😋
Now lets see it fly! 😏
With the star destroyer, the table also looks like Legos...
 Keep that away from the rage monster.
It would take me 2 years bro
What the fuck has no one given the gold.  Fuck it here ya go
How do I get a jacket like that?
I was gonna buy one but says 3 years and up and I don’t have that time even with the stay in place
Oh my god, you’re fucking adorable. Please don’t let anyone dim that joy.
I had a friend who was so excited to show me his finished republic cruiser set, he picked it up and it collapsed right in his hands. I being the supportive friend, immediately started laughing. He moved away though, not sure if he ever got around to rebuilding it.
please, consider making lego millennium falcon Lando's version and take a photo while dressed up like Lando! You look pretty much like him!
Dope build. Even more dope hoodie.
Once this quarantine is done. Can i come over and play legos with you?
Please tell me you spent your stimulus check on that if youre in the states.

I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.
Don’t know how long and painful it is to build that, but if you had trouble, you’ll get PTSD watching Dude Perfects new quarantine stereotypes
Here's an upvote
Impressive, most impressive
Unrelated, but I recognized your account from r/marvelstudios posts...how come you changed your old account?
Badass man
Nice Destroyer, nice hoodie!
Oh damn, that looks very hard, wish I had one of them for passing time.
It’s really impressive that you managed to construct a living human being despite the fact that you’re only a star destroyer made out of legos.
 Impressive, This will make a fine addition to my collection. Fantastic mate
Damn! Nice work!
Great Cesar's ghost... how many pieces?
Man does anyone miss the original set of Bionicles. I need legos....
Looks great dude. I bet that was really fun to build
Dude so awesome.... My jealousy is infinite
That’s awesome!  Good job man!  I’ve been building a lot with my kids recently.  I just finished Yoda.  My daughter built the Frozen Jewelry Box.  She was smiling like you when she was done.
Good shit dude!
Holy crap! That’s awesome! 👍🏼
Legendary
Love the little *Tantive IV* that gives it scale.
Stunning
Marques? Is that you?
This is the way.
Damn, two days? that looks like an insane amount of pieces
You should attach some small TIE Fighters to the outside so that they look like they’re flying past it.
For a second I thought the table was made out of lego.
Amazing...bravo!
Awesome
Yoooo that's so dope bro!!
I hate how expensive Legos are for 2 days of building.
Awesome! Love the hoodie too!
r/cr90corvetteforscale
I tried to get that set and my wife laughed in my face. I am beyond jealous. Good work.
I want that coffee table, bruh
looks great my man
Did you sleep at all?
That tower was quite the pain, well done looks great! Took me ~15 hours
$700 well spent.
I want that hoodie!
Don't drop it
I knew you could do it!!!
I have the older version of that and put it **back** together a few weeks ago because quarantine! Was going to post to r/LEGO but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. Maybe tomorrow.
Looks like Jon Jones is making the best of his house arrest! Good job, champ!
Don't let Tyler from Dude Perfect near it. That [monster](https://youtu.be/eZUKSxE2UZg?t=4m35s).
Love this. Told my wife I wanted one and she gave me that look of “not a chance”. 🤦‍♂️
2 days my ass.
all this is missing is a dog running in with a huge smile and destroying the entire thing...
Dude has mega patience. Well done
i could never be focused enough for this, good job!
That looks seriously awesome. Amazing work dude.
Wow the corellian corvette really puts into perspective the size of a Star destroyer.
This looks like my wallet hates it.
Pizza
Only 2 days??
Nice table congratulations
I miss that joy of finishing a lego project.  Also that thing looks freaking awesome!
Looks awesome dude.  Well done.
Is it kraggled?
Unreal man, !!! How much does something like that run you?
And.... the jealous meter just ruptured
Sweet jeezus that’s beautiful.  I love Spider-Man.  The star destroyer is pretty cool too.
30th birthday coming up in a couple weeks. If it doesn’t show up wrapped I’m thinking about maybe getting one of these for myself as a present...
The table looks fantastic!
Jealous! I am currently building the Ewok Village and adding in a few AT-STs to boot
Dope AF!
Kinda unrelated but you have such a nice smile!!
Damn dude that's a fast pace. I've maybe done 10 hours and I just finished the back for the engines. [https://i.imgur.com/W407zpk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/W407zpk.jpg)
2 days, fuck this would take me at least 5 years to get over how many pieces and start the thing.
Where’d you get that sweet sweater?
Awesome!!!! My brother and I have been saving up to get that set along with the Death Star and Millennium Falcon.
Tiling sucks and who ever put that thing together had allot of patience for something I'm sure most dont care to use a coaster on.
Ahh, so THIS is where Palpatine got them all from.
Watch out for Green Leader!
A little over 2 days??? That would take me months.

Edit: Also, I dig the Spider-Man jacket!
Did you build your coffee table too?!
I'm so proud.
late to the party but wanted to say fucking awesome man! Great work!
Shit I saw a UCS Star Destroyer and Millenium Falcon in a Lego store near me months ago and I was so tempted to spend all the money I had earmarked for non-essential spending on the ISD. Decided against it though so I'm super jealous that you have one hahaha Post a follow up of the completed thing being displayed!
It's awesome
Cool cool cool dude. Awesome
That smile says “ok I’m pretending it didn’t happen but when I though no one was looking or listening I was like “pew pew pew WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH”
Summed up perfectly, I hope John has a long career away from this

Having him lead a Storm Trooper insurrection would’ve been cool too
Then we found out at the end that he actually is force sensitive but it doesn't matter now lmao.
We thought Finn was special because he was a stormtrooper who rebelled. Turns out there are shitloads of ex stormtroopers
Problem was they just kept abandoning his storylines.

- love interest for Rey? Nope

- Love interest for Rose? Nope

- love interest for Poe? Nope

- possible Jedi? Kinda, but we don't even get to see it because the series ended

- leads Stormtrooper rebellion? Nah there are a lot of ex- stormtroopers

- sacrifices himself for everyone else? Nope Rose won't let him

They just didn't know what to do with his character
Who else would they get to run around and yell "REEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYY" every 10-15 minutes?
A Stormtrooper turned Jedi would have been badass.
I agree with this 100% and have been saying this for a while. Finn genuinely had the most interesting initial  backstory. It would’ve been amazing to see the character start out as a reject stormtrooper and rise to the rank of Jedi Knight throughout the span of a trilogy but nah.

It also sucks because John Boyega is actually a pretty decent actor as well.
One of many valid criticisms of the sequel trilogy, yes, what was the point of the character? It seemed like in TFA he was set to be a central character and ended up little more than an extra.
Finns original arc of disillusioned storm trooper turned rebel leader was interesting, but I feel they just forgot about it? Like towards the end something was missing. It’s a little how I feel about Padme from the prequels. Badass queen and fighter turned crying weak women that dies because of sadness? What the actual fuck? Her character should’ve been strong enough to at least survive for the kids. I know she was dead in the original trilogy so I’d rather see her die from protecting baby Luke and leia or something
It's almost like they *wanted* the audience to think he was going to be a jedi to drum up excitement.
Truth. He was probably the most fumbled character out of the new trilogy which is tragic because he has an incredibly compelling backstory. JJ took a great actor playing an interesting character and made Finn set dressing by the third movie. 

Boba Fett had a bigger impact on the plot of his era’s trilogy with fewer lines across two movies than Finn did with significantly more lines in one film.
While I like Rey, I do think having Finn be the Jedi would’ve been cooler. 

Imagine, a former stormtrooper who served under Kylo Ren, runs away from everything to end up with Luke Skywalker. The opposite of who he served. And think of how it would be for Kylo. The guy he has to fight was under his control and he couldn’t sense that he was force sensitive.
Absolutely botched every main protagonist. Shame. They should have planned out the trilogy, what on earth were they thinking?
I know it's a meme but literally all he does in IX he yell No and Rey. I wish I liked that movie but man it's just not good.
Should of had Finn and Rey be two fresh Jedi figuring out their style together. And Kylo Ren holds his own against two newbies instead of Rey “Tee-Ball Swing” Skywalker.
That’s JJ Abrams mystery box bullshit for you!
Why not two Jedi?  

Why does it always have to be one?  A second Jedi the Force chose to help rebuild the Knights?
Finn should have died in the end of the second movie and not saved by Rose. It would be unexpected and an awesome death.
I’m actually more upset that Rey technically became a Jedi in the end. While Disney would never do it, if Rey died and wasn’t brought back then I think thematically that’s better. Rey was “all the Jedi” and palpatine was “all the sith”, and if both of them had died it would have meant the end of both with the only one remaining being Ben solo, one who has become on neither side and allegiant to none. Meaning that the chosen ones throughout time have now balanced the force with no sith and Jedi left to change the tides
I originally thought the point of “the big three” (rogue stormtrooper, republic pilot, backwater junker) was that they would all eventually become force sensitive: three people from three drastically different walks of life all bond together to form the new Jedi order. Their force sensitivity would have been the result of some type of cataclysmic event (like if palpatine got resurrected by a bunch of ancient sith wierdos or something crazy like that), erego the title The Force Awakens.

My hopes were too high.
This is what the sequels were: WASTED POTENTIAL!!!!! Finn not being a Jedi, Maz getting nothing, Phasma and Snoke getting killed off early, Rose, Poe, Palpatine not being introduced until 9, that other ex storm trooper that had 1 scene with Finn, Knights if Ren
I really hope they give the sequel characters more development in TV shows or side movies, like they did Clone Wars and Rebels

The sequel universe feels so small compared to the Prequels and even the OT
They didn't plan their billion dollar franchise at all.
He was the token black guy. Fuck hollywood.
I think it’s stupid how there continues to be just one Jedi who faces down the entire overreaching hand of dictatorships. There can be more than one Jedi.
Yea they did him dirty. Introduced as one of the main stars but by the third film he just seems like an extra. Wtf.
Why not? It worked. I'm mixed and I saw a black dude being promoted as a protagonist so I got excited and went. They hoodwinked me with a "buh-buh GHOSTESES" stereotype. It was as scummy as it was clever.
Oh that's just an inclusive bait. "Hey our movie puts a minority in the spot,watch us!" And then they back off to the things that make *real* money. Don't know how someone can be surprised by this, happens all the time
I cannot believe how well the force awakens brought back the hype for new star wars films, and then they completely butchered it with the next movie and lit it on fire for the finale.
Agreed. 

I would have wanted to see his charater grow a bit more. 3rd movie should have been where he does something amazing out of himself.
Wasted potential is just the perfection summation for the sequels in general.
Something something Chinese market appeal something something
The more I think about it and the more I watch them, the sequel series was basically the GOT S8 of the franchise.
Finn, what I considered, the biggest misuse of a character’s potential ever. He had so much going for him and could have been one of the best characters in all of Star Wars, but he was tossed to the side.
Forget being a Jedi. Imagine Finn, kidnapped as a child and indoctrinated into being a slave soldier, says "To hell with this," and starts a one man crusade to find and liberate the FO's child soldier indoctrination camps and straight up hunting the insidious and utterly ruthless Captain Phasma who runs the program leading up to an ultimate confrontation on the level as any of the great Jedi/Sith fights, a fight that proves that regular beings can be just as bad ass as laser sword wielding space wizards. But no, instead we get Phasma being a jobber and Finn stuck as the comic relief sidekick to the worst written character since Jar Jar.

*cue space Jesus chained to a post in a Genosis area*  
Good job.
Yeah they did Finn dirty.
Goddamn this trilogy was such a dumpster fire. And this post just reminds me of it.
In the words of Robert California:

Disney Disney, you've completely bungled this!
I hate how the developed the crap out of Finn's character and did basically nothing to Rey. Then instead of building them up together, they just threw Finn to the sidelines and made Rey a jedi.
Even with less screen time than ray he's 100% more interesting
Because the new trilogy was a pile of dogshit.
Did you miss the whinging that went down when a certain subset of fans found or they'd be a woman AND a black guy staring in the first one.  Quiet sore that had now to do with his being demoted to nothing and Poes not dying than anything else.
i disagree i dont think he should of been a jedi, i do how ever believe he should of had a story about liberating the storm troopers rather than just deserting them
Directors didnt even let Finn ask Rey his question
Finn is equal billing protagonist of 8. His arc is a quarter of the main plot.
In my honest opinion? He’s the new Chewy to Po’s HAN, same attitude and all. 


Thank you very much! Please throw the tomatoes to the left!
I think the main trio (Rey, Finn, Poe) should’ve all been force sensitive and utilize it in different ways.
All that “Rey I gotta tell you something!” stuff was supposed to be him telling her that he’s force sensitive. idk why we gotta go out of our way to find that info, just put it in the movie.
the Chinese would've hated it.
I remember a fan theory years ago when the force awakens came out that was something like the "awakening" was through Finn and that while Rey's force abilities were gifted, they were from a natural affinity with the dark side, rather than light, which is why snoke was more concerned with Finn's awakening than Rey's. They were predicting that while Rey starts out good, she ends up turned to the dark side. The revelation being she was a palpatine but only finds that out after she gets disarmed by Finn and Kylo in a light saber fight or something then jumps to her death upon hearing the news and can't deal with it. Kylo would also have his own redemption arc, turning to the light as Rey turns to the dark. 

When I read that, not really being a big follower of Star Wars, I thought, "that sounds pretty cool." Then I found out about how the story actually went in the last movie after being thoroughly disappointed with 7 and 8 and thought they really screwed the pooch.
Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic REMAKE has been announced!

Confirmed that it's gonna be rebuilt from the ground up. I wonder if they'll change the story up to fit in canon or leave it in legends.
That’s pretty incredible. Kotor is one of my all time favorite stories in any media. I wonder how combat will be affected given more modern games veering away from the RPG turn based style that kotor originally had. I also wonder if Revan will remain customizable with Swtor still going.
Pour one out for your homies in r/AskReddit who now need to find a new answer for the weekly "what game is due for a remake or remaster" thread
What do I do with my hands
I will caution the new players that havent played and are gonna use the as an opp to jump in. Be careful of the blogs you read about the game. PlayStation Lifestyle spoiled a major plot point in the second paragraph of their post. Just an FYI in case you want to be more cautious.

Edited to be as spoiler free as possible.
Greatest star wars game of all time
ALL HAIL LORD REVAN!
I'm looking forward to that shot of Revan being like 90% of youtube profile pics lmao
Do you think they are going to canonize the story then?
I move the notion we should abbreviate this game as KOTORR. 

Luuke apporved!
KKKKOOOOOTTTOOOOORRRRR
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HOLY SHIT
Hk47 baby!!

This meatbag is getting a ps5
LET'S GOOOOOO!!! FINALLY
Please god don't be a PS5 exclusive

Edit: PC confirmed by Lucasfilm which is great, still feels bad for Xbox users. Fuck exclusives (even if only timed)
ITS HAPPENINF EVERYONE GET IN HERE
Darth Bastilla can have my babies
KOTOR II Remake too please! It’s been so long, and there are great aspects of the story to wham into the canon.
I'll sell my wife to buy a PS5 for this if it's an exclusive
This is where the fun begins
According to the Playstation blog, it’s a “console launch exclusive”. As that language usually goes, that probably means it’ll be on Playstation and PC at launch, then Xbox at a later date.
[~~Trailer~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8)

Teaser Trailer
Was the original KOTOR even on playstation? I don’t remember it being on it and I didn’t even join xbox by owning my own Xbox console till about 2008/9
Wow!!! My first play through will be like this is a brand new game!
Time to wait 25 years until it releases with TES 6, GTA 6, and Cyberpunk 2
I heard they are adding a new ending. Turns out Reven was Palpatine the whole time!
That's fantastic. Would bringing KOTOR into the modern era of Star Wars mean that it will be made canon? Perhaps with a few tweaks, if it's a remake and not a remaster?
HOLY FUCKING SHIT I NEVER WOULDVE EXPECTED THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
I wonder if they're gonna redo the krayt dragon to look like Mando?

edit: I'm watching the Playstation event and they just said it will be a remake with a new story.
https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/09/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-the-legendary-tale-remade-on-playstation-5/

Playstation Blog saying its a Console Launch Exclusive
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO KOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR
They are out of their minds if they make this a PS5 exclusive  


Edit: Hope? https://mobile.twitter.com/lucasfilmgames/status/1436066933032439824
I have never played the original and freaked out. Shows the impact of this game.
If what you have told me is true, you will have gained my trust.
I'm just worried that someone with a political agenda is going to reduce the raw sexuality of HK-47.
I'm happy/sad my friend always loved knights of the old republic and always wanted a remade version but he's gone now :(
Absolutely had better be on PC.
I was screaming during the reveal. A top 3 favorite game of all time for me. I absolutely cannot wait for this.
I'm not gonna get too excited... only ends up leading to more heartbreak in the future
Happy lightsaber ignition noises
I can't wait to purchase part one of three in 2026 for 70 dollars.
Hopefully we can finally get another game with the same lightsaber effects as Jedi academy.
Great, now make a 3rd one too
[deleted]
My friend texted to ask if I was interested in the showcase.

I said 'nah, it'll be stuff we already know about or cross-gen stuff, there's nothing they can announce that will interest me'

I was proven wrong immediately. Let's goooooo. KOTOR is up there with best star wars of any media.
So now they finally acknowledge Revan and everyone else as canon. Beautiful.
new matrix movie and Knights of the old republic remake just came all over our faces today
I can't wait to have Carth Onasi wearing ridiculous space visors again while Bastila struts around in her underwear. God I miss this game
The developer has never made an rpg and Sam Maggs is involved. My expectations couldn't be lower
I’ve never played the OG but heard incredible things. What game would be a good comparison to expect? But Star Wars of course
PS5 exclusive… *cries*

I was always a PlayStation guy. Bought an original Xbox when I was a kid JUST to be able to play this game which was an Xbox exclusive at the time. Beat it, beat the sequel, sold the Xbox (hated the original if I’m being honest). Now, later in life, I opted for Xbox because it’s what most of my friends play and I like playing games with them… and now it’s a PS5 exclusive. Just my luck. Please someone talk me out of buying a PS5…
Can someone help me to understand how this worked? It’s getting remade for pc and PlayStation but not Xbox? IT WAS NEVER RELEASED ON A SONY SYSTEM! And how did Aspyr get their hands on it? I thought BioWare or obsidian had the rights?
KOTOR has better storytelling than the Disney movies- fight me
I'll wait to get hyped until after the announcements and articles with controversial deviations from the original and disappointing platform or monetization strategy.  Then if it passes muster there, I'll still hold off, not preorder, and wait until they announce all the features and content they've cut.  Then finally, after launch when a torrential onslaught of complaint and criticism get published without the marketing filter, I'll evaluate whether it's worthwhile.

If they don't mess around, stay true to the original story, market test deviations from original mechanics, run it buy to play with all content in the original included at release, and have it on PC, it'll be legendary.

If you're holding your breath, let us know so we can have medics check in on you. inb4 marketing buries this comment.

No joke though, if they do this right then they'll be swimming in money like Mr. McDuck.
The greatest boner killer in Star Wars will be the KOTOR remake getting announced for a console nobody can buy. Big brain right there.
 Are you all hoping they keep the original combat mechanics or they they update it to something more akin the modern games like Jedi Fallen Order? 

I’ve never liked those type of games where you choose the action and the character does the rest and it’s all up the chance. I’m hope hoping you have full control of the combat myself.
When? Where?
No Xbox?! Im gonna die
I’m really excited about this. I never got a chance to play the originals.
I never played the original, but I'm super pumped to play it this time around.
Too bad it’s PS5 and Pc only so far, hopefully this changes considering how many gamers wanted this remade.
