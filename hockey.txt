Rest In Peace Kobe, from the hockey community. üôèüèª

Shit was so out of left field... It still feels weird
You just think legends are gonna live until they are old and pass naturally. This is so sudden and shocking.
First reported by [TMZ](https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1221516283671433216), then confirmed by [Wojnarowski](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368) and [LA Times](https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1221523683174281216). 
Just...absolutely shocked man.

update: [TMZ](https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1221533868433592320) is now reporting that one of Kobe's daughters was also on the helicopter and died in the crash.

update 2: [Woj](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376) is reporting that they were on their way to a travel basketball game and the other victims on board include another parent and player.
I hope this stays up. For a lot of us, Kobe was one of the first mega-stars that crossed all sports

As a kid playing basketball in Canada, I grew up idolizing two players: Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant. I tried my hardest to play basketball the way they did (obviously couldn‚Äôt because of how good they are). This is an awful day for sports

Insane. Something I would have NEVER expected to read.
Kobe Bryant changed the sport of basketball. He will always be an icon in the sporting world. Absolutely heartbreaking. Rest In Peace, brother. üòû
This is absolutely insane. I'm shook. He tweeted LeBron last night and now he's gone.
Such a tragedy. Leaves behind a wife and 4 kids, including a newborn... My thoughts are with them.
The mood in LA right now is extremely somber. You can feel the sadness in the air and tell how everyone‚Äôs been impacted by the devastating news in some ways. This is gonna be one of those ‚Äúwhere were you when you first heard the news?‚Äù moments and it‚Äôll be with us Angelenos for a long, long time. RIP Black Mamba, a legend who gained his wings today.
We just got done putting my dog down and the first thing I see is a text from my friend saying ‚ÄúKobe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù What a terrible day. Life is so precious
This one hits hard :( 
RIP to the legend
Kobe is wearing a Gretzky sweater in the pic. Today just so happens to be Wayne‚Äôs birthday üéÇ
I don't even watch basketball but yell "Kobe!" every time I throw something. Damn.
So incredibly sad. Basketball isn‚Äôt my #1 sport, but kobe was a legend. Condolences to his wife and children. Can‚Äôt believe this is real.
Thats the hardest I've been hit by a celebrity death since I heard Robin Williams died. Rest in peace you absolute legend.
Are we gonna see all hockey teams having a moment of silence for him before games?
I‚Äôm not even a basketball fan, but this took my breath away. Fucking legend. RIP.
Let‚Äôs not forget to pay respect to his daughter or anyone else on the helicopter for that matter everyone is important to someone.
I would rather lose the next 100 Stanley Cup finals than see this news today. I‚Äôm heartbroken. I‚Äôve idolized Kobe my entire athletic life. He did it right, inspired millions, and is a true legend in every sense of the word.
Even if you don‚Äôt like basketball, at least once in your life you have tossed something in a garbage can while yelling ‚ÄúKobe!‚Äù I guarantee it.
Can't believe it. Just watching sports centre this morning and they showed him showing James love on twitter for passing his scoring record. Rest in peace, legend
RIP Kobe. Kids will forever say ‚ÄúKobe‚Äù while throwing up shots, or just throwing paper in the trash. 

Your [last game](https://youtu.be/y64OsZNYhp0) was something else.
This threw me off so bad. Fuckkkkk.
Dude‚Äôs name was literally a verb for when you shot something into a hoop or basket. Not the biggest NBA fan but this hurt bad. RIP to his daughter and the other people on the helicopter too, gone way too soon.
One of the line cooks at my job, race doesn't matter but just to picture it he's a really big tough looking black guy, saw it on his phone first and started whispering no and then just broke down crying mid service. Kobe meant a fucking lot to a lot of kids growing up.
_/
So sad and tragic.  Way too young.  I saw the Lakers in Toronto with Shaq and Kobe.  Fan of the Lakers since 1980.  Saw a lot of unbelievable moments from Kobe.  Definitely a premiere elite athlete in our time.

Prayers to the family.

RIP Kobe.
Kobe was an ambassador of the sport. His name is synonymous with excellence. This doesn't feel real. RIP to a legend :(
Honestly one of the most shocking deaths this decade will see. To see such a well liked man, a legend and just overall a man who was respected across so many different sports pass away is just not right, its just not right and it doesn't feel real.
This sub is too edgy
His 13 year old daughter was also killed
Man. I keep hoping I'm dreaming. Absolutely crushed, gutted.
https://twitter.com/WayneGretzky/status/1221526681749463041
RIP Kobe. I feel so fucking bad for his family and all that knew him. His wife is now a widow with 3 kids, one being a baby. Can't even imagine what she's feeling losing her husband and child üò¢üíî
Thank you guys for this....don‚Äôt know why, but this means a lot.
I was never a massive NBA fan, only casual, but I remember as a kid watching Sportscenter before school and seeing highlights of Kobe from the night before. 

When I heard the news I honestly didn‚Äôt believe it. Aside from Mac Millers death in 2018, this is one that hit me for the mere reason of that Kobe was one of those cross platform athletes that you could reach across to anyone. 

I can also say that Kobe is probably the first major athlete of my generation to pass away. I‚Äôm 26. There might be others before him, but he‚Äôs the only one I can think of that I grew up watching. RIP!
I cant imagine what his wife is going through right now

RIP to a legend
R.I.P. Kobe. This is the equivalent of Sidney Crosby retiring and then dying in a freak accident shortly after.
This is like if Gretzky died. This is absolutely terrible for the basketball community. And for his family too, of course.
Never been a basketball fan but it‚Äôs always sad to lose a life, even more so one that touched so many others as someone so many looked up to. My condolences the basketball community and the families of those aboard.
Might have been because Kids' WB since they'd show Lakers all the time during the commercials, my mom getting us NBA Live 2004 always playing as the Lakers. But I've been a Lakers fan for years, and I'll admit hockey's my sport while basketball is a small part of my life, still always looked forward to news on Kobe, Shaq, Lebron ect.

This is truly devastating to the basketball community and sports as well, RIP to a true legand Kobe Bryant.
My most favorite athlete of all time.
Nobody worked harder than Kobe when he was in his prime. To play 3 more years after the achilles is awesome. Goodnight Mamba
Sad day in sports. Rest in peace to one of the best ever.
It's really interesting reading these comments.  I've never been an NBA fan either, yet I feel more intensely about Kobe's death than any other in recent memory.  I'm still trying to figure out why.
I can't believe it. RIP to one of the best basketball players ever.
what in the actual fuck
Chills are going down my entire body every time i see the headline. I just can‚Äôt believe it.
RIP Mamba I will still yell Kobe in your honor whenever I throw trash away
This is fucking awful. I don‚Äôt watch basketball but that man was so good at what he did. It transcended basketball. It‚Äôs heartbreaking learning about this and then finding out he had a daughter with him. I‚Äôm still in shock. RIP Mamba. You were a fierce competitor and always rose to the occasion.
Rip
Nah this is so fucked
Kobe leaves such a legacy behind. I've never been a basket ball fan, never even watched the game up until the Raptors went on the win the championship. But I knew exactly who Kobe was. I knew in gym class when sinking a bucket, or throwing away that test into the recycling bin what yelling "KOOOOOBE" meant.

Kobe Bryant left a legacy. 

#KOBE
Kobe was the largest sports figure here. RIP Mamba.
This is fucked
This is now the top post all time on hockey. Just shows how much this man meant to not just basketball but the entire sports world. We lost an absolute legend today in the sporting world, and it makes it so much more heartbreaking one of his daughters was there with him.

His wife and family are in everyones thoughts and prayers. Hopefully they can reflect on the good everything Kobe did in his time on this Earth, and can heal quickly. RIP Kobe.
I feel so bad that the daughters died RIP
41 years old, still in the prime of his life. What a fucking shame. Doubly so the one daughter was confirmed to be on the helicopter too. 

No family deserves to lose its dad and kid at the same time, man.
This doesn‚Äôt feel real to me.
It really is sad, and so unexpected, he was a legend and will never be forgotten. He's in a better place now. Rest In Peace.
RIP
Bruh. Terry Jones, Neil Peart, and Kobe Bryant?

This is about to be one helluva year.
I thought this was a stupid joke about Edmonton or something. Can't believe it.
I'm in Wyoming right now and people are somber about it here too.  He was a national treasure and transformed Basketball.  RIP to him and his daughter, and I hope the ones left behind find peace.
Edmonton!?? 

Seriously though, I'm not a Kobe or basketball fan at all, but it's an unfortunate incident. His daughter was about the same age as mine (13 vs 12). I really feel for his remaining family.
Didnt know how close he was with so many hockey players.  Ovie was wrecked when he talked about it.
RIP Kobe!
I have got to be honest, I haven‚Äôt thought about him since the stuff went down all those years ago. I was of the mind he was being blackmailed back then but who knowsü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think it‚Äôs super trashy that people are making such terrible memes and comments about a tragedy. 9 lives lost. That‚Äôs something to remember.
I was pretty excited for Kobe to be an old 80 year old man, grayed out and everything, talking shit about some 19 year old player just out of college. 

This is really a tragedy for sports. Literally one of the greatest most determined athletes ever.
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Didn‚Äôt he rape a few women?
I'm sure I'll get down voted worse than anyone in the history of this sub, but why are we celebrating a rapist?  I feel bad for all the families involved. But celebrate someone who deserves it, not a rapist.
Absolutely insane it feels like this is impossible to happen, and I‚Äôm not even a basketball guy. RIP to a legend. Sad day for sports
I'd like to see teams make up some Kobe jerseys and hang them from the rafters for a little while. 

This man transcended sporting codes..  he will always be a legend.
Seeing no mentions of it here so I'll link it

Shareef O'Neal (Shaq's son) [shared a DM](https://twitter.com/SSJreef/status/1221531785273569280?s=20) he recieved from Kobe about an hour before the crash. Then to see that he (Shareef) responded "*How you been*?" but after the crash happened is some real gut wrenching shit.
This post is currently the 2nd most upvoted post in r/hockey history. It's clear this tragedy transcends barriers between sports.

Edit: Now #1
He stayed at a resort my dad worked for a while ago.  He had in-house dining, where they send a chef over (my dad in this case) to make food.  He had two 12-egg omelettes a for breakfast.  Absolutely legendary
He was larger than life, had a magnetic presence and had such charisma. Never another like Kobe Bryant. He was like no other. He was destined for greatness

RIP Kobe Bryant
Good lord. Some of the comments in here make me ashamed to be a part of r/hockey.

That said, I was never a huge basketball fan but I respected the hell out of Kobe and his work ethic. He inspired a lot of people in many different sports to be better and work harder. RIP Kobe and everyone else who lost their lives today. So fucking sad.
[deleted]
He was a rapist.
Plus he beat those rape charges that nobody is talking about.
If you're going to have tunnel vision and bring up rape on the day of his death, you're just as much of a piece of shit as you think he is. You're morally posturing to make yourself feel special, if you weren't you would just stfu.
Never a Kobe fan but Prayers for him, his Daughter, her friend, her parent, and pilot along with their families . Really weird hearing the news but sudden losses are.  Prayers
RIP KOBE
I seen Arsenal community coming together and respecting his legacy! This means soo much from us here thank you!
The first celeb death where I called my mom to tell her. So unreal.
This is so sweet. From a completely different sport. RIP KOBE and his daughter. So sad.
One of the greatest athletes of all time üíî R.I.P
Fucking legend, üôèüèæ‚ù§
Holy shit, I can't believe he's actually dead. Awful day in sports
Holy shit.
Was one of my childhood heroes. üò≠
Me being a Celtics fan so I obviously obligated to hate the Lakers, but this news straight up dropped my jaw and was hoping that it was not real when I first saw the initial reports. Kobe is a fucking legend in the basketball world and he always give the Celtics a really hard time. I offer my condolences to Kobe's family, former teammates, and to the Lakers organization.
I was in elementary school when Kobe and Shaq were doing the three-peat. To us at school, they were gods walking. I knew Kobe and Shaq even when I knew nobody else in the entire NBA. I never even saw them much on TV. I didn't even know why I knew about them, I just knew they were so, so good. We all wanted to be them. 

RIP
I never really got into basketball.  But as a Kings fan I saw his retired numbers and the championship banners he helped his team earn hanging from the rafters of our barn.  This is a sad day for the LA sports community and the sporting community in general.

My condolences to the Bryant family, the Lakers organization, and all Lakers fans everywhere.  He was a legend and the sports world is lesser without him.
This is such a tragedy. Besides losing Kobe, his daughter and the other parent and child were also lost. So sad.
Cant fuckin beleive it, watched him alot with ky grandpa when I was younger. 41 way to young :(
RIP legend. Unfortunately just another lesson on how none of our lives are guaranteed üíî
Man. Only 3 celebrity deaths have actually affected me and Kobe is one. Augh. I feel so sorry for his family.
I always yell kobe when i throw something. It just doesn't feel the same now. Also I have never been a basketball fan but everyone knows who Kobe Bryant is.
i still can‚Äôt believe this i‚Äôm at a loss for words
I don't follow basketball or hockey, but I admire and respect the admiration of one of the greatest athletes to ever live given by this community. I'm with you. Arguably the GOAT.
RIP Kobe and Gigi. I dont follow basketball anymore but when I was a kid I loved watching Kobe play. Feels so bizarre that he‚Äôs just gone. I feel for his wife! I cannot imagine losing my daughter and husband at once.
Kobe Bryant was probably one of the few basketball stars I distinctly remember seeing on Sportscentre as a kid. 

He's a sporting legend in my eyes and it's honestly a shame that he, along with his daughter and the other passengers on their helicopter had to pass away like that.

RIP
Its now been confirmed that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was also killed in the crash.

I can't possibly imagine what his wife an surviving children are going through.

RIP
Truly awful. Prayers to his family members
Shine bright like a diamond. RIP
I honesty don‚Äôt think a bigger star will die in my lifetime. Rip Kobe Bryant.
Well fuck, I was never an NBA fan, but you fucking bet that Kobe Bryant was one of the prolific players and he was one player you knew his name. He was awesome on the court, and was a better father off the court. It‚Äôs sucks to lose one of the NBA Greats in a tragic situation and especially difficult that one of his daughters passed away in the crash as well.

Condolences to the Bryant Family and /r/NBA. 

Silver lining to the unfortunate circumstances was that he was able to witness the Eagles winning the Super Bowl: https://youtu.be/DoyzoiJcSq4

[Game recognize game.](https://youtu.be/QQWOwH62RP4)
üôè Rest In Peace kobe!!
He died on The Great One's bday
Crazy to think the death of an entertainer could make the world feel like it‚Äôs standing still. That‚Äôs what it felt like yesterday.
Absolutely devastating. Thank you Kobe.
I love that he wore the jersey properly - 3 sizes too big
Yes, let's all shed a tear for the rapist who bought his way out of responsibility.

Edit: Unlike u/flyingsponge14, I stand by my statement.
Didn't he sexually assault women?

Weird this try-hard woke ass sub would tout him around.
Kobe Bryant was a rapist
>First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year. Although this year has been incredibly difficult for me personally, I can only imagine the pain she has had to endure. I also want to apologize to her parents and family members, and to my family and friends and supporters, and to the citizens of Eagle, Colorado.

Kobe Bryant apologizing to the 19 year old girl he raped in 2003.
Some of these comments are embarrassing. No wonder we'll always be the #4 sport in America, unless the MLS passes us. Everyone is just a bitter bitch
Growing up in the LA area I was obsessed with hockey while all my friends were obsessed with the Lakers. And I'll be honest, I didn't care as much for basketball or the Lakers. But what kept me watching their games was Kobe. There was something about him the way you can just sense greatness in a person. And more than that he was such a universal role model when it comes to traits like hard work and determination. 

There were two athletes that defined my childhood that I looked up to as idols: Teemu Selanne and Kobe Bryant. Both respective sports felt so much emptier without them. The world feels emptier without Kobe now. Rest in Peace, legend.
He transcends all sports
No matter how much I hated the Lakers, I always admired and respected the way he played the game.  Always kind of thought Kobe would be around forever and always to grow old and and even mentor future players in the league. My deepest condolences to all their families and friends. The NBA is a brotherhood. The NHL is a brotherhood. Sports as a whole is a brotherhood and this is going to send ripples, no, waves, across the league. His loss is a enormous loss in every regard  and I hope he'll be remember and cherished. RIP to Kobe Bryant and the other people on that flight üôè.
His 13 year old daughter was with him üò≠ Rest In Peace, you guys.
One of a kind.
It certainly didn‚Äôt come disrespectful at all, and when I say ‚Äúhit hard‚Äù that means it hit me in a similar way to you I guess
Rest In Peace
Just stunning and sad.

Never really cared about the NBA beyond wanting the Suns to win and being happy San Antonio had a winning team, just treated it as a league to idly root for whoever had good logos or whatever when I glanced over the standings. But Kobe was *the* superstar of his era, the next Michael Jordan, or whoever you want to compare to before #23. Iconic. I feel for his family and his fans.
Should make a tribute on the side bar or the title graphic.
One of the worst days ever. Still don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not a dream.
God damn legend left us today. 

Today I won't put anything in the trash, everything will be thrown from at least 2ft with an enthusiastic "KOBE!".
I've never been a big NBA guy, but Kobe was the one dude I always loved watching.  His competitiveness was out of this world.  RIP to one of the greatest to ever do it.  RIP Mamba.
Fly high my man
I still refuse to believe this is true.
Remember that time he raped a 19 year old?
Has to be one of the worst starts to a year ever...
Kobe Bryant was a violent rapist.
The man who got me to watch basketball
RIP Kobe...Everyone please watch Dear Basketball... it‚Äôs 4 minutes, and worth it.
Kobe was a real ass dude. RIP legend
Idk what Kobe's knowledge of hockey was like but how Kobe is to of all jerseys wear the Gretzky classic Kobe move one goat wearing another goats jersey RIP legend
Sure he could dribble, but never forget he paid off a woman so she wouldn't testify about a rape.  The Donald Trump of the sports world.
Get that karma
This may not be hockey related, but honestly I couldn't imagine another post being top of all time on this sub. It speaks to how big a player you were. Rest In Peace, Kobe. My middle school days were all me pretending to be you on the court, and flubbing almost every shot. But no matter what, I still called Kobe. Thank you, and may you have a peaceful afterlife.
Does this mean he won't rape any more hotel employees?  Look it up.
Basketball is my first love and I grew up a Lakers fan.  After Magic left the game when I was 6, I didn't gravitate to another star until Kobe came along.  

He was my childhood favorite, through the middle and high school years.  I sided with him over  the beef with Shaq.  I hated on LeBron as the heir apparent.  

He had his flaws but there wasn't another player I enjoyed watching play basketball more and I guess this is what it feels like when a childhood favorite passes away.  I feel like I lost a friend.  It sucks.  

Condolences to his family and all the others.  Rest in power.
Him and his daughter too....

Fuck this hurts.
This is awful news. His daughter was with him, I‚Äôm heartbroken
Surreal pic of Kobe considering it‚Äôs also Gretzky‚Äôs bday today
I‚Äôm so heartbroken. As a dad it pains me so much. R.I.P. Black Mamba. Thanks for the parades the tears The Wins The losses and the many laughs. LA Loves you. May you and your daughter walk hand in hand into heaven.
üôèüôèüôè
Even heros die

RIP
Wait what ... oh my god, I thought it a joke at first about the Oiler jersey or something... then I read the first comment, then I googled 'kobe' ... oh.. no... no nono ... I have so many Kobe jersey's ... I admired him so much...  I'm so shook from this wow
Damn 41 is so young too. Respects to the man
are we all forgetting that his lil girl died too.that hurts almost as much as his death.RIP 24 we all ‚ù§Ô∏èu

The devil always collects.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant_sexual_assault_case
One of the most famous basketball players ever. RIP Brought me to basketball
His oldest daughter was also on the helicopter with him. Truly shocking.
I don't watch Basketball at all, but am absolutely floored by this. Reading all of the threads, seeing the reactions from some of the players, and just experiencing it all is pretty emotional. RIP to one of the greatest athletes to ever live.
'Mighty Ducks' star Shaun Weiss is over 230 days sober!

[deleted]
Good for him, addiction is a fucked up monster that is hard to beat 

1 day at a time
That's an insane transformation.
He's also got a new set of chiclets. 

https://pagesix.com/2020/09/10/shaun-weiss-more-than-230-days-sober-receives-new-teeth/
Don't relapse, don't relapse, don't relapse.

With the reboot incoming, he's got a chance. Just got to stick with it this time.
Goldberg! Goldberg!
Wow, he looks 40 years younger.
I‚Äôm 236 days myself. This is awesome and a great motivator to stay the course. Stay strong, man!

Edit: Shoutout to the good folks at r/stopdrinking! A wonderful community for anyone looking for a place to start or a place to keep going or just a sympathetic ear.
Oilers are looking for a goalie from what I hear
This is the kind of positivity I needed today
Good luck to him, and to anyone else who's on a similar journey.
Wow, last I had seen his photo he definitely did **not** look like Goldberg. I'm very happy that he looks a lot like Goldberg again. Stay strong buddy.
Just saw this guy on a few episodes of Boy Meets World. My SO had no clue who he was or what I meant when I said, "That's Goldberg!"
Quack
FUCK YA
This makes me happy, I'm glad he's starting to look like himself again.
im only on 30 days clean from cocaine, but its a big deal considering i did it on average every 2 days for 13 years.
That is great to hear. He‚Äôs starting to look like he did when he was a kid.
What a change! Congratulations to him.
Wow, I am 233 days sober today.
I hope he makes it and stays clean.
Great to see. Was certain he was at deaths door when I saw those pictures
That's amazing. He looks so much healthier, and more than that, happier. Good for him!

Also good on his friend for not giving up on him and realizing how much of this was due to mental health reasons.
GOLLLLDBEEEEERG !!! atta boy
This is an honest question, and I‚Äôm not trying to offend anyone, but what substance and at what usage rate could cause someone to look that unhealthy at such a young age (then be back to looking great 10 months later)?

Edit: in any case, I‚Äôm very happy for him and I hope this progress continues. I‚Äôm so glad he is on a good path.
"And when we get arrested for doing drugs and then get sober?!?!"


DUCKS FLY TOGETHER!!!
God bless him. Hope he keeps it up.
He looks so much better in that second pic as he was completely unrecognizable in the first. Regardless of the circumstances that led to that point it's heartbreaking to see addiction take such a toll.
This makes me super happy. Goldberg was my favourite. In undergrad I was on a ball hockey team and we all wore replica Mighty Ducks jerseys, we all picked a different character. I was the goalie so naturally I wore a Goldberg jersey.
I'm proud of his sobriety. I myself am 92 days sober and life is fantastic. I know my kids are loving this new me and the energy that came with it.
Man good for this guy. Shocking it‚Äôs the same person.
This is gonna show up as click-bait for years to come.
Josh waaaaasssss baddddd.
Nowwww Josh goooood.
Looks like at least ONE person is having a good 2020.
Crazy how much drugs can age someone
He looks 30 years younger than he did before. Happy for him.
Quack!
Way to go Shaun! Keep steppin, you're powerful!
Wow, what a turn around. I honestly thought he was months away from death when the left photo made headlines. Keep it up dude!
[https://tenor.com/view/heavyweights-happy-agree-josh-this-gif-4954895](https://tenor.com/view/heavyweights-happy-agree-josh-this-gif-4954895)
Hoooly fuck.

I work at a shelter on Skid Row in LA and now I'm wondering if I saw him pass through here during the worst of it. Glad he rebounded, christ.
I'm ten years sober and it never ceases to make me happy to see posts like this. Hope he sticks with it.
Josh was bad....Josh now good
 I Understood Myself Only After I Destroyed Myself. And Only In The Process Of Fixing Myself, Did I Know Who I Really Was. 

Wish him the best, the struggle is real.
Wholesome! I hope he sees this and sees the love he is getting! Keep going fella!
So happy to see this. He‚Äôs had some dark days for sure but he seems to have finally been able to turn it around. It‚Äôs pretty tough getting healthy again but he‚Äôs looking fantastic, so I‚Äôm hopeful he has a wonderful support network. We‚Äôre rootin‚Äô for ya, Shaun!
I just watched Freaks and Geeks and he's a semi-regular in that as well. Glad to see him looking healthy again.
Let‚Äôs go Goldberg!
Yes! So happy to see him healthy and happy, I was pretty bummed out seeing Goldberg like that. I hope he's getting whatever treatment and support he needs to continue his sobriety.
Damn he literally looks 30 years younger on the right
Good for him. It's a long and hard fought battle to stay clean, but every day is a chance for new victory
I AM GOLDBERG!!!

THE GOALIE!!!!!!!
This is the kind of good news that I would have not expected but is a fucking joy to see
Must be... good to see my big ass again!
That can't be the same person. You're saying the picture on the left is prior to the picture on the right? The guy on the left looks 65 and the guy on the right could be in his 30s. WOW
Congratulations!! Keep it rolling! We are all pulling for you!!
I love a comeback story! Props to him and hope things keep getting better.
Wow, he looks great -- like two totally different people. 

Have to give his friend Drew massive credit for helping him get into treatment and just being his friend in a time when he needs it most. It's not an easy role to have and I'm sure his support means everything to Shaun.
Maybe he can talk to Gritty about cutting the habit.
Yes! Good for you Shaun! Just know that this random stranger is rooting for you, I am very proud of you. :)
it‚Äôs stunning how the body can bounce back
Every single hockey tournament i went to, when we had to travel on a team bus we watched all the mighty ducks movies.you are an idle to so many hockey players.

Keep up the great work!
Heavyweights star. Excuse you.
He was better in heavyweights.
Josh was bad. Josh now good
This pleases me!
Finally. A happy fucking story.
Ducks fly together.
Drugs are a hell of a drug
Great save Goldberg!
I refuse to believe that is the same person. 

Holy shit. Good for him.

One day at a time.
Skinny dude on the left is a hottie with those come to bed puppy eyes
I just watched a movie with him in it last night.  It was called Pumpkin.  Perhaps the most F'd up movie ever.
Holy shit! good for him man! :D
Hell yes Goldberg!
So glad to hear it
The legend who broke a camera with his ass
This makes my heart happy
He looks amazing! This is brilliant news, I hope he keeps it up.
Crazy how the body can transform itself like that
Good to hear. Hopefully he stays that way.
Even his beard looks younger.  Remarkable how much of an impact that lifestyle has on your body.  Hope he continues to stay healthy.
This brings me so much joy. Good for him!
Holy crap, I'm so happy for him.  And for the people close to him; his downslide must have been awful to witness.  You rock, dude!
Big save Goldberg!
Holy fuck. That's incredible, never ever I thought I'd see him sober.
People without addictions see th day count and might not think much of it, but every addict knows it's a day to day fight
Goldberg?!  Holy shit. Amazing turn around, addictions a M F‚Äôer
This is good news. I was pretty bummed when those pics of him all strung out first popped up on Reddit. I'm glad to see he's getting himself turned around and I hope he makes it.
Happy to see anybody turn their life around, kudos duder
I'm so happy for him. I hope he stays clean. It was heartbreaking seeing him go through addiction and the toll it took on him.
He looks 20 years younger.
Seriously great news. I don‚Äôt care about his acting but just that as a person he has recovered. Looks so much better.
Ducks don‚Äôt say die
I wish I had it in me. Cant even make it through one day
This cheered me up. Thanks for sharing!
I *SWEAR* I read that this guy died last year. Like I really really remember reading about it on here and twitter....
Yay Goldberg!!
#CAMP LEGEND
Amazing and beautiful
The quack attack is back, Jack!
Thank god.
Damn man looks 30 year younger. Ive been ‚Äúdown in a hole‚Äù probably on the same shit before but this guy jeez. I know he must be glad hes not stressing about dieing everyday
I would‚Äôve thought the guy on the left was like 70. He looks so much better and happier now. Good for him.
Props to his friend Gallagher.  Seems that his conviction to help Shaun really helped pull him out of a terrible place. Not everyone can be so strong and compassionate.
holy shit is that really him on the left??
Yay! Goldberg's back!
Very good but needs to get to a couple year mark. I was a user and up until like 2 years I would get really bad cravings every once in a while
That is so amazing!! I'm glad for him
Fuck yes! Good for you. So needed some good news!
He made an appearance at an Anaheim Ducks event a few years back and was a mess then. It just got worse from there. Glad to see he is sober now.
My wife and I have been rewatching King of Queens recently and saw him pop up a few times. I recognized him from MD and wonder what happened to him afterwards. Then I saw this news about his sobriety and looked up pictures. Dude was unrecognizable but now looks fucking amazing.
Good for Goldberg!
Thank god, I remember seeing how messed he up looked and am happy to see he‚Äôs effectively recovered. He looks so much better.
Such good news in a hell of a year. He was a part of my childhood, and sucked to hear he was so bad off. I'm glad he's recovering, and if you see this, or anyone going through this sees this, keep it up. You got this.
No Heavyweights love?
Jesus fuck. Meth, kids. Don't do that shit.
Everyone's peter fitz if you push hard enough, Uncle Tony.
I was browsing through popular posts,  dont really watch hockey,  i have no idea who he is but well done,  what an amazing transformation and i am so happy for him
Thank god. I remember seeing a post about his condition earlier this year and it was completely tragic. Staying sober from meth is incredibly challenging, and I'm so proud of the progress he's made so far. I needed some wholesome news.
Quack
Reversed his age by 40 years it looks
Maybe the NJ native can return for a celebratory slice at Kinchley's or Nelly's.
Seriously didn't believe this post until I verified it myself.  Shit path with a better outcome.
I just watched the Might Ducks Trilogy and heard about what happened to him. Good to know he‚Äôa doing well.
He looks really good! I hope for even more health and happiness for this guy
Josh was bad. Now josh good.
Congrats to him man so inspirational
Congratulations! Good for you!
Noice
So happy for this guy, when I saw what drugs did to him it just hurt ya know?
Bravo üëè
That‚Äôs great news, he looks fantastic!
THE GOALIE!
He's got a carbo load up you know. Much donuts bread lots of bread.
Holy fuck there's no way that's a before and after left to right!? I had no idea somebody could recover like this??
LETS GO BABY!! KEEP IT UP!!
He went from 85 to 35.
goldberg goldberg.
Yay for good news in 2020 and yay for Shaun Weiss kicking butt at sobriety!
holy fuck
Holy Sheeit, quack attack is back jack
The quack attack is back jack
Fucking amazing!
Now get him into the D+ show and give him another chance!
Holy shit, congratulations man.
Good on him! That‚Äôs awesome. Keep it up
Good for him.  Must be odd that people eagle eye this guy so much but hopefully most of us snoops wish him well.
Good for him. A lot of people gave him a real hard time and completely dismissed him when this story first came out. I didn't like seeing that. I'm proud of him.
Wow. That before photo screams methamphethamine abuse. Good for him.
Meth is a life destroying drug. I found my second cousins mugshot online and I didnt even recognize her. I'll probably being going to her funeral at this point.
Damn, now THAT‚ÄôS a glow-up
Fucking right Goldberg!
Guys only 42 years old.. that photo on the left in heart wrenching.
Please keep it up man
One day at a time !! Congrats!‚ù§Ô∏è
I would like to congratulate him on his sobriety!
I am so happy to hear he is doing better!
Congratulations!!!!
Poor man
Holy, man went from looking like my great uncle to my cousin. Good for him. Addiction isn't easy
That's great and just in time for a run at the Stanley Cup!
Looking more and more like a man who can clear the back of a limo with a single fart.  Well done fella.
GOllllDDddddBBbbbEeeRrrrgggGg
This good to see. The photos were circulating all over the place when he got arrested. I was afraid that is what he would be remembered for and even if there was a change most people would remember his arrest photos. I hope this photo gets reposted to a bunch of subs, so people can see he got sober and turned his life around.
QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK
Wait...is that Goldberg? He's looking a lot better. I hope he can keep it up.
Does this mean we get a quirky bus driver for the Tv show now?
I loved him so much when I was a kid, damn I hope he continues on the road to recovery. Wish I could give him a hug.
He Benjamin Button‚Äôed himself. That‚Äôs awesome! Good for him
the Mug shot was from ***january.***  


damn he's looking healthy and 15 years younger in just 9 months!  


I hope he can keep up sobriety
I‚Äôm glad to see this. I‚Äôm remember having to escort him out of work one day after he came in not in the best of shape and was hiding behind some draping. I was crushed when my supervisor pointed out who he was. I didn‚Äôt even recognize him until he had mentioned it.
It's so fucking awesome to see, as I'm in recovery myself I always love seeing that people are working hard at being sober, plus he was a massive part of my childhood, I hope he gets happiness and a shit ton of love from great people
*Goldberg:* Careful guys! The puck almost hit me that time!

*Spasway:* Goldberg, you're the goalie. It's supposed to hit you!

*Goldberg:* Does that sound stupid to anyone else?
'Please, no more war': Alex Ovechkin responds to Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Putin deserves an Ovi slapshot to the skull
1500+ Russians were arrested yesterday protesting the war.

&#x200B;

Important to note that Putin does not have support of all of Russians. Hell, hey may not even have support from most Russians. Having spent time in Eastern Europe, I can tell you many Russians have Ukrainian friends (and vice versa).
I think this is the best we could hope for from Ovi. It actually sounds like something he'd say and not something a PR rep wrote for him.
People don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs not that easy to speak against Putin. Dude is clearly insane.

What Ovi said is very minimal but he understands that what is happening is wrong.
Yet he was still buddy buddy with him in years past. Putin didn‚Äôt just become an evil piece of shit overnight.
His whole family is in Russia. This is an absolutely massive statement for him to make and his words carry a ton of sway in Russia. Obviously he was going to say something but I can't say I'm not surprised he said this, good for him.

I don't think anyone could really expect him to outright criticize Putin. I wish he could but he wont.
War should only be waged on the ice, between whistles.
Remember where Ovi once was, launching a political movement in support of Putin:

https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2017/11/02/alex-ovechkin-launching-political-movement-support-vladimir-putin-heres-why-thats-problematic/
Ovechkin is in a lose-lose situation. Hopefully his family will be alright.
Bro - he literally said he still supports Putin, lol.
This headline is a lot more sensational than the actual interview. Alex basically said the same 3 rehearsed sentences for 3 minutes straight and only said ‚Äúplease, no more war‚Äù when he was directly asked if he wants there to be a war.

He didn‚Äôt say anything wrong, but he also didn‚Äôt say anything groundbreaking. This is a whole lot of nothing.
He avoids giving an answer if you read the article
He also replied ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my president.‚Äù to a reporter asking him if he supports Putin.
Well he said more than I expected but he definitely said nothing of value really
You guys think this is brave? He‚Äôs a huge Putin supporter, and likely just wanted to protect his personal image with a generic anti-war statement that he knew was safe. Guy‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs pro-Putin, I have little respect other than it adds to the very reasonable anti-war statements being made by public Russian figures. Fuck war, and fuck Putin
This is not a brave statement. This is not some weird "read between the lines to find out he's actually against the war" thing either. This is a business move that lets him save face in both Russia and the US. If you want to know where he stands just look at his past actions.
‚ÄúDo you still support Putin after he started the war?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is my president.‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt exactly call out Russia, if you read the entire statement. This one statement sticks out to me. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard situation right now for both sides and everything.‚Äù 

No Alex, it‚Äôs a hard situation for Ukraine.
Lol, Says this but still has his insta pic as him posing with putin.
Are people really pretending that Ovi hasn‚Äôt supported Putin for years before this?  He says he‚Äôs not political, but he‚Äôs campaigned for Putin before.  Am I missing something?
Fuck you, you "team putin" piece of shit!
Russia is 2 days into a war that the population already doesn't support. Just wait till more Russians realize that Ukranians aren't fucking around and are willing to defend their country. Could be the end of Putin as we know it. All he had to do was slightly cooperate with the west and then he could have done whatever he wanted with his billions of dollars.
Did he change his IG photo yet? No? Ok
I'm just weary since basically every Russian athlete on a world stage has said the same thing. "No more war, please" or "Please, no more war." I'm not saying its not genuine, but it is very likely that is the maximum they can say, without getting in trouble. Its just like every single one with skin in the game said the same thing, so I definitely think there's an "allowed statement" they can give. Again doesn't actually discount the truth of that statement, its just sad we'll never truly know the depth of their true feelings on this matter because its clear they've kinda been given a stock amount of words they can say without stepping out of line.
when he has to spin this to the russian media he will say "I meant no more war from the Ukraine threatening Russia" 

at least what I could tell here it was kept pretty damn vague but I imagine he can make a million dollar contribution to the Russian war effort and all will be forgiven
He wants it end soon as in he wants Ukraine to surrender soon. Ovi has always been a Putin dick-rider and he always will be. 

GTFO with this "Ovi is so brave" bullshit
If I were him I would not have spoke against the war with family in Russia, this is probably the best response he could've given in a situation like this.
Are people forgetting Ovi supported Putin‚Äôs election several years ago? He‚Äôs a likable guy, but at least for a while now has been a supporter of the Putin regime. This ‚Äúwar is bad‚Äù non-statement is 100% expected and in no way ‚Äúbrave‚Äù.
Saying "please no more war" but also still saying "putin is my president" ?
Chicken shit Ovie refuses condemn Putin.  Go Fuck Yourself ovechkin.
Weak ass statement by Ovie. Should not be surprising since he‚Äôs a Putin supporter. Ovie has enough money to never see Russian soil again, he‚Äôs not like your regular Russian citizen who is in actual danger in Russia. Condemning Putin is the only real response and a response that would have huge positive effects cause of Ovies celebrity and hero status in Russia. He could and should do a lot more. Of course this is r/hockey and Ovie will be praised regardless.
This was the biggest non-statement ever. Dude wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge Russian aggression, wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge anything. Way to sit on the fence when there aren‚Äôt two sides
[deleted]
I wish someone had asked Ovechkin how he actually wants the war to end. He all but blames people on both sides and expresses fear for his own family. His family's not in the country getting invaded by the most aggressive military force we've seen since 2003 but okay. 

In 2014 he very explicitly showed support for Putin's *last* invasion of Ukraine and parroted the party line of Putin being a liberator saving Crimea from fascism by annexing them. Putin is using the same exact garbage to justify this invasion. 

I find it very, very difficult to believe Ovechkin has earnestly changed stances on this. And I maintain that Ovechkin, as a powerful, rich athlete who reaps all the benefits and status of being a Putin ally back home, has made this statement more to obscure his true feelings on the matter from the West than to hide them from Putin.
His Instagram photo is him and Putin. Fuck you Ovi
Shut the fuck up, Schweinehund.  You've spent your entire career being a cheerleader for that dictator.
Too little, too late.

Ovechkin has been a Putin supporter for years and embolded him while the writing has been on the wall.
If you speak out against "war", but do not specify which of the belligerents needs to stop, then your comments can just as easily be interpreted as telling one side they need to hurry up and surrender.
Wow PUTIN TEAM  CAPTAIN  is calling for no more war. How about no more putin you pus%%# arse –±–∏—á.
How many fund raisers did he headline for Putin?  F*ck this guy.
While I acknowledge that Ovechkin is looking out for his family who are still there. But his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an athlete not a politician is bullshit. This is a guy who actually stumped for Putin in the last ‚Äúelection‚Äù and he also called Ukrainians fascists the last time Russia invaded Ukraine. So while I get he can‚Äôt really be too strong also fuck him. He made the bed he‚Äôs in.

[deleted]
This is a guy who has openly supported Putin and his agenda for a long long time.  It's disingenuous.
Disgusting statement by Ovi. Should be forced to come play for the Canes as punishment in my unbiased opinion.
This is about as good an answer as he can give. His family is in Russia, and this doesn‚Äôt attribute support one way or the other. Saying anything remotely resembling anti-Putin sentiment is opening the door for his family to be put in danger
>Ovechkin's Instagram profile picture is a photo of him with Putin, who gave the Capitals star an ornamental tea set as a wedding gift for his 2016 nuptials. Putin also sent a **telegram** that was read at the wedding reception.

What the fuck
This is a completely useless statement! Putin wants nothing more than the war to stop. He will stop it when he have control of Ukraine. 

If he said that Russia should stop invading Ukraine, then its different
>	Well, he is my president. But how I said, I am not in politics.

Uh-uh. 

>	In 2017, Ovechkin announced on Instagram that he was organizing a movement to support Putin. Ovechkin's Instagram profile picture is a photo of him with Putin, who gave the Capitals star an ornamental tea set as a wedding gift for his 2016 nuptials. Putin also sent a telegram that was read at the wedding reception.
The man is close friends with a psycho and still says nice things about him. How can anyone be a fan of not so great 8
"Can we fuckin' not right now?" - Ovi
I appreciate that the Athletic didn't put this behind a paywall.
I was almost hoping Ovi would back Russia so I could hate him more

Go Pens!
Woah boy - those are some strong words
Wasn‚Äôt Ovi in support of Putin in the past? This is pretty significant
In short. He wants peace, but he doesn't condone what's happening "he's my president"
He didn‚Äôt say shit, ovechkin won‚Äôt condemn a man he adores.
I still don‚Äôt want to see these rich Russians entering my country
At this point, Putib doesn't deserve to die easy he should be locked in a very public prison that anyone can visit and request light torture to be performed on him but not to the point of dying, then just fix him up just enough to survive the next day for another round
Its great that he called for an end to war but otherwise an extremely weak statement from ovechkin. He did the bare minimum. Essentially stated that he still supports putin as his president despite the war. 

Ovi deserves zero praise for doing the bare minimum.
Ovechkin was also Putin's confidante in elections. Not impressed.
A Putin friendly line, ‚ÄòNo more war‚Äô.  It‚Äôs called ‚Äòequivocation‚Äô.  Anyone who reads this as ‚Äòanti-Putin‚Äô is naive. He‚Äôs blatantly not anti-Putin. 
They are fed a different narrative in Russia than we are here, and he‚Äôs on that drip. 
If he were to try to speak to both sides (which he is a good position to do) he‚Äôd get ripped by our media, hence, ‚Äòno more war‚Äô.
Dude has kowtowed to Putin before. Fuck him.
Call your friend out.
That's a weak ass statement right there. He could go right out and tell Putin to stop the invasion. But Ovi might just be telling Ukraine to surrender with this "no more war" BS.
Send Ovi‚Äôs commie and Putin loving ass back where he can spoon with his comrade. Fuck Ovi! He does not deserve to enjoy his freedom in America after his outright love displayed for Putin over the years.
Please no, more war
Spineless. But all the fans of the team he‚Äôs on love him. Cowards.
Don‚Äôt give him too much credit. He  couldn‚Äôt say the words ‚ÄúPutin is wrong‚Äù. Men, women, and children are risking far more by protesting in the streets of Russia.
Complete chickenshit move on his part. He should grow a set.
Is it No More War to Putin? 

Or is it...

Give Up. Stop the War. Let Russia win
His interview didn‚Äôt help him today‚Ä¶
[deleted]
Do you think he meant it toward Ukraine, like ‚Äúplease, no more war, surrender‚Äù?
> When asked if he supports Putin as the president leads the invasion of Ukraine, Ovechkin reiterated how he hopes the attack ends soon.
>
> "Well, he is my president. But how I said, I am not in politics. I am an athlete and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon," Ovechkin said. "It's (a) hard situation right now for both sides and everything. Everything I hope is going to end. I'm not in control of this situation."

Sounds like he is still on "#TeamPutin", but that he just doesn't want to be blacklisted by the NHL and because he still has family in Russia. Although someone with resources like him would & should have relocated his family if this came down to the risk of them being disappeared. 

Remember that Ovechkin also claimed that his "#TeamPutin" post in the middle of Russia's 2017 election was not "political":


> Asked if it meant he supported Putin's political beliefs, Ovechkin said, "It's not about political stuff" and that he doesn't try to be a political person. The Russian presidential election is scheduled for March 18.

&

> Ovechkin posted a message in Russian on his Instagram account Thursday saying that he‚Äôs starting ‚Äúa social movement called Putin Team. Ovechkin added that he has never hidden his feelings about Putin and has ‚Äúalways supported him openly.‚Äù
> [...]
> The 32-year-old Ovechkin is from Moscow and has often been photographed with Putin. A photograph of Ovechkin and Putin accompanied the post, in which the longtime NHL star says, ‚ÄúBeing part of this team makes me proud and it‚Äôs similar to the feeling you get when you put on a Russian national team jersey, knowing that the whole country is rooting for you.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident that there‚Äôs a lot of us who support Vladimir Putin,‚Äù Ovechkin wrote in the post. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs come together and show everyone a strong and unified Russia!‚Äù

If he was only saying that to stay in Putin's good graces, he should have acted to relocate his family members. It appears that he did not.
"I'm not a politician" but you campaigned for Putin. Fuck this guy. Other Russian athletes that are not as big as ovi are speaking out.
Honestly I think way too many people are giving Ovi a pass here. It's not the statement that's the issue. This is probably even more than we could have hoped for in terms of that. But Ovi has actively recruited Russians into Putin's military. It's not like he's just some dumb athlete. He's the biggest celebrity in Russia and has actively campaigned for Putin. I say all this as someone who absolutely loves Ovi too. It's all very disappointing
It's incredibly sad that something this milquetoast is a massive statement, but it is. Respect to Ovi
He's getting away too easy. 

So he can initiate a Putin fan club to help him win elections but when things take a turn he uses the "I'm a hockey player, not a politician"-card. 

Never knew you could play hockey without a spine.
I‚Äôd just like to point out that Ovi‚Äôs statement is a whole bunch of nothing. This man has publicly supported Putin for years, raised money and political support for him, is married to the daughter of an Oligarch, and parroted Russian propaganda about ‚Äúsaving Ukrainian children‚Äù when Russia annexed/invaded Crimea. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PutinTeam

https://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6079369/ovechkin-putin-ukraine

Sources above.

ETA: he‚Äôs also the kid of Soviet athletes, so he was born into this propaganda
Ya fuck him. Enablers like Ovi have tried to help ‚Äòhumanize‚Äô this monster in Russian press for years.
Chickenshit. 

This guy is absolutely Blackhawks front office material if I‚Äôve ever seen it.
Are we sure this is what he ‚Äúreally‚Äù wanted to say? Every other day he‚Äôs sucking off Putin, just look at his Instagram. Family of oligarchs get him out
That's a weak fucking statement. Fuck ov.
Incredible, suddenly I've forgotten his years of Putin brown nosing and shilling!!! Wait, hold on . . actually I haven't. Fuck off Ovi.
#please, no more Ovechkin
I mean if Putin touches Ovechkin‚Äôs family the Russian people will turn on Putin in a heartbeat, he is their golden boy. Ovechkin has reached a level in Russia that probably precludes him from retaliation unless he was outright supporting Nalvany.
"Please, no more war. It doesn't matter who is in the war ‚Äî Russia, Ukraine, different countries ‚Äî I think we live in a world, like, we have to live in peace and a great world."

I will disagree with everyone here believing this is a big statement.

He is a millionaire, he doesn't ever have to go back to Russia, and attacking a celebrity's family isn't really in Putin's sights.

Everyone protesting last night across Russia and today has the actual risks to their life and their own family.

I see no bravery in Ovechkin at all. In fact, this sounds more like appeasing American and European audiences than actually believing Russia should not invade sovereign nations.

Bravery only exists when you have something to lose. This statement has plausible deniability to each audience. That is not bravery.
It's a good statement. But he needs to get Putin out of his fucking IG profile pic, like WTF
Please, fuck yourself! You was silence/supportive for your cruel idiot-dictator for about 20 years, after lots of wars, invasions, ocupations.
Guys a pooty boot licker. Condemn the man, not just the war.
I'm from Finland, so I'm obviously biased in this whole situation, but *"Well, he is my president."* just seals the deal for me to not have any respect for him at all. Zero. "*He is the president*" might have been enough of a cop-out, but he is still saying Putin is *his* guy, and that I can't stand aside and accept from anyone anymore.
Idk why people thought Ovechkin would voice support for the invasion. Even if he did actually support it he definitely wouldn't announce it to the world, he'd stay silent about it, he's not an idiot. He's a huge nationalist but I'm glad he still has a moral compass
I‚Äôm surprised people still like Ovechkin. The guy is clearly in support of Putin and his actions.
Ovechkin stands with Putin.
Not enough for Putin‚Äôs NHL puppet
I'm sorry, this is bullshit coming from a hard core Putin fan. This statement helps no one, Putin himself could say that he wants "no more war". Ovi is a coward for not speaking out.
All Putin associates like Ovechkin who have helped to keep him in power should be sanctioned, have their assets seized, and be deported. I don't care what he has to say now. 

As for the ridiculous argument that his family is at risk, he could have moved them to the US years ago. He clearly profited from his association with Putin. 

People have to stop thinking of him as a simple athlete that gets a pass. He's a prominent Putin associate who has actively worked to keep him in power and needs to pay a price.
What a world class piece of shit
good that he said something but people one thing to remember is that it's also a CHOICE to "leave/have" your family stay in Russia. They are allowed to leave and he can afford to pay for them to have a very comfortable life anywhere in the world (why not a big mansion in washington). So imo yes it would be stupid to say something against putin in this situation when he has family in Russia BUT don't forget Ovi himself (or his family members chose) to stay and put him in this situation as well
almost word-for-word, Ovi is repeating the Taliban's statement.
‚ÄúPlease no war‚Äù yeah ok, that will change Putins mind.
How about instead of being putins lapdog he should call him out.
Coward
You know what, screw Ovechkin, what a fuck. This is clearly wrong, no grey area. What a dope. If he loves putin so much he can go ahead back to Moscow and and give his hero a handy
I hope Ovtsa is going to take multiple hits on his face with a hockey stick. He's a fucking asshole who deserves to spend the rest of his days in jail. Fuck him!
Putin is not a President, he is a dictator. Ovi has now seen the true Putin, and hopefully will change his opinion of him... I hope.
Kind of a meaningless statement. Can be interpreted in a million ways and puts no real criticism against Putin. I get it though.
Can we PLEASE call this invasion a terrorist attack? It‚Äôs literally terrorism, especially when the head terrorist leader says they will use nukes against people 
That‚Äôs LITERALLY terrorism!

‚ÄúDepartment of Defense Dictionary of Military Terms defines terrorism as: The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.‚Äù
Yah OK Ovi. Fuck Russia.
Glad to see Ovi speak out on what happened with Russia invading Ukraine. I respect for him speaking in the circumstances that he‚Äôs been placed under. While he‚Äôs been buddies with Putin in the past, he knows he has to toe the line to not cross the line. 

It‚Äôs devastating to see what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine right now.
Putin is killing children and this spineless coward still refuses to denounce him. Fuck Ovechkin and fuck everyone who supports him.
He DOES have one of the highest WARs in the NHL this season
Putin deserves to get a slapshot to the head and balls
Need more of these celeb types to use their social channels to condemn Putin and his war crimes. Don't sit silent for fear of losing $$$$$. Take a stand against this horror. No place for war in a so-called modern age.
I commend Russians who are able to & have spoken out publicly against this mess. I was telling my sister yesterday, that social media has made us forget that not everyone has the freedom to speak out minds so freely. Social media has blurred border lines; shit these days we have VPNs to thank for Russian & Chinese memes (among other things). We need to remember that people are still being killed and/or jailed today for the simple crime of speaking their minds. 

War is never a good thing, but I'm hoping that this conflict really reminds us what we've got & not to take it for granted. And reminds the idiots that they have the freedom, the privilege to act like idiots & to wake the fuck up. They're not victims; the true victims are actively being killed & executed.
Did he change his Putin avatar tho
Then maybe take down the profile pic?
This is probably as harsh a condemnation as he is capable of giving.
It feels like we can‚Äôt do much from the outside but - Russia depends on technology just as much as the rest of us. Pressure the tech companies to cut them off. 

PRESSURE THEM THE WAY YOU PRESSURE YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS!

The St.Louis Blues have Clinched their first Stanley Cup in franchise history defeating the Boston Bruins 4-1 in game 7

The Red Sox broke the curse in St. Louis, and the Blues break their curse in Boston. It's only fair.
Gotta love how 15 F bombs in they just keep the sound on
Wow didn‚Äôt realize Backes got healthy scratched. That‚Äôs gotta be brutal seeing your old team win and you‚Äôre not even on the ice to try and stop it
Anyone got a live Fuck counter going yet? Holy shit, NBC must be cringing hard.
Ryan O‚ÄôRielly just said fuck on national tv
From last to Champions in 6 months. What a run
unreal game by Binnington, absolute unit in the crease
ROR: ‚Äúwe knew we were gonna fucking get it‚Äù [...] ‚Äúagain sorry for swearing, I feel so bad‚Äù 

Haha I goddammit I love this sport
A team that fired its coach in November and had the league's worst record around the midway point of the season  just became Stanley Cup Champions. That's fucking insane. Congratulations Blues
WHO CUTS TO COMMERCIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF CELEBRATING WITH THE CUP?!?!?!?!?!
"Fucking right!" "Holy fuck" They aren't even trying to censor them and I appreciate it. Five seconds of silence during something like this is a buzz kill.

Edit: They apologized and "turned that mic off" :(
In the year of our Lord Gritty, this post season makes literally no sense. Embrace chaos.

1 overall team that had one of the best regular seasons of all time? Swept in the first round.

Eastern conference road to the finals? Islanders sweep Penguins. Canes swept Islanders. Boston sweeps Canes. Boston loses in the finals.

Every top seed in all 4 conferences? Not a single one out of the first round.

Team that won the cup? Literally DEAD LAST in January, and had a losing record AT HOME during THIS POST SEASON.

Chaos has arrived.

Edit: why thank you for gold, kind stranger!
Lol, good on Boston for staying to boo Bettman
We now live in a world where the Blues & the Cubs have won championships more recently than the Cardinals & the Blackhawks.
On my way

Don't let the Blues beating the Bruins in game 7 and winning their first cup in 52 years, after the Bruins swept the Canes after the Canes swept the Islanders, and the Islanders swept the Pens distract you from the fact that the Lightning were swept in the first round after a historic season.
Someone has to make sure Brett Hull doesn't die tonight.
It all started with Mike Yeo being fired as head coach, then hiring Craig Berube as interim head coach. The Blues were dead last in the standings on January 3rd. On January 7th, Jordan Binnington made his first career start, and shutout the Flyers 3-0. They went on a stunning 11 game win streak, and finished 3rd in the Central. They knocked off the Jets, Stars, Sharks, and Bruins to win the Stanley Cup.



This will be a story for the history books. Congratulations St. Louis Blues on your first Stanley Cup! PLAY GLORIA

From last place to Stanley Cup champions, this has been one hell of a season! I'm so fucking pumped. Let's go Blues!
FOR THE LAST TIME I‚ÄôD JUST REALLY LIKE TO THANK THE CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS FOR NOT MAKING THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR 

Actual tears this is the last I have to post this. What. A. Season.
HOLY SHIT WHAT EVEN IS THIS YEAR????? BLUES WIN THE STANLEY CUP! RAPTORS LEAD AGAINST THE WARRIORS! AND IN THE NFL WE....well...you can't have everything..
you guys showed tits last year, don't act like profanity is your dividing line
With tonight's Game 7 loss to the St. Louis Blues:

The Boston Bruins are now 2-6 in their last eight home Game 7s played against teams not named the Toronto Maple Leafs!
Losing a SCF game 7 at home. 2011 sends their regards.
As a Blues fan I‚Äôve been waiting 49 years to say this.

FUCK STAN KRONKE
It sounds like the 4th of July outside - people shooting off fireworks everywhere. It's fucking 10pm but hey fuck em' 

LET'S

GO

BLUES
**J.R.:** How did you bounce back after a devastating Game 6?

**Binnington:** It's whatever, man.
I, 4-1, welcome our new Blues overlords!
Refs TOTALLY missed that too many men on the ice call at the end there
I love NBC for not giving a shit right now 

‚ÄúFUCKIN RIGHT‚Äù

Chara‚Äôs jaw died for this
What a fucking cinderella story from last in the league to the fucking stanley cup

Good fuckin shit Blues, way to get your first cup!
32 years old, been going to games since before I can remember. Dad passed last November. The only thing that could make this better would have been watching this game with him. GO BLUES
TURN THE MICROPHONES LOUDER
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Lightning on winning the Stanley Cup!
That Binnington saved when it was 2-0 is the single,  most clutch saved I‚Äôve ever seen from a goalie.  

Wow. Binnington was so unbelievably clutch today, MAD. MAD respect for the way he played.

I love this guy hahah
They actually fucking did it! The mad men!
Never heard so many live F-bombs as these Blues lifting the cup.  It's very very good.
How fucking annoying is it that they go to commercial while the players are taking their laps with the cup. NBC fucking sucks. I'm not even Blues fan but I like seeing that moment for all of the players.
This hurts the the Bruins chance of winning to Stanley Cup.
I still don't feel like this is real life.

NBC struggling with the F-bombs lmao
My buddy, Adrian, died unexpectedly on December 29. He was a huge Blues fan. He was only 49, so he'd never even seen the Blues play for the Stanley Cup that he could remember. He went to Vancouver to watch them ultimately lose, shortly before his death. Always upbeat despite them not doing well early in the season. 



After his death, the Blues of course started doing great. I've never been a hockey fan but started following them because of him. 



He would be so fucking stoked right now I can't even describe it. He was enthusiastic under even poor circumstances, and with this win, I don't even know what he'd be doing, probably partying naked in the street haha



Love you, Jackson RIP

This is up there with 18-1 and the baseball color barrier getting broken for the worst moments in Boston sports history.
lol so many F bombs right now, I love it
Today is a bad day for Boston, and therefore a great day for the world
This post might get the most awards in this subs history.

I know how good the Blues are. They‚Äôve been so hard to play against for years. They‚Äôve got great talent, and even though I was fortunate enough to accomplish some great things in Toronto, I never got the one thing I‚Äôve always really wanted.

The Stanley Cup.

IT WAS 4-1
It honestly hurts a lot less knowing we were completely outplayed tonight. Congrats to stl.
It‚Äôs been 5 months since Boston has won a championship. Literally in shambles right now
I wish NBC did more cuts to the crowds in St. Louis
Fuck NBC for not showing us Binnington hoisting the cup. Fuck that.
HAhaha they had to go to commercial and cut the mics because of all the swearing
EXALTATION LANGUAGE!!

There is a god
Not so fun when it happens to you is it Boston?
haha, NBC turned the players' mics off
Can someone check on Brett Hull
If ESPN cared about hockey, this would be a spectacular 30 for 30.
FUCKIN RIGHT
The Blues were dead last on my Mom‚Äôs birthday. They won it all on my Dad‚Äôs and will bring the cup home on mine. What a fucking wild run of bdays it‚Äôs been.
so many live F bombs, this is great TV
Bozie raising the cup in Boston. Must be so rewarding

LAILA GOT TO LIFT AND KISS THE CUP
Watching Marchand cry on the bench is the biggest cherry on top ever

I 4-1 like this outcome
So the key for St Louis was never go on the powerplay.
"Dad, was that a bad word?".

"It certainly was son, it certainly was".

*Wipes away tear*
First time my flair didn‚Äôt fade
Just here to say congratulations to all the OG Blues fans who have been waiting a lifetime to see their team hoist the cup above their heads. As a Canucks fan I know too well the pain of the never ending drought. Really happy for you guys, it was a heck of a run and certainly well earned. Enjoy the celebrations!! üéâ üéà

"Chicago outplayed us. The Blues fell ass backwards into a cup they didn't earn, taking cheap shots and having multiple players get suspended in the process, stealing a win from ref incompetence along the way as well."


- comment from the Boston thread, 35 points.

The Boston fans acting like they somehow have a moral claim to this cup has me very erect
This must be a huge moment for Alex Pietrangelo and his cousins.
FUCKIN‚Äô RIGHT
Pardon me but did those young men just say a bad word on TV?

TLDR: fuck
Also thank fucking god we finally beat a Boston team
And with that began Boston's 100 year championship drought.
This Blues season needs a 30 for 30. It‚Äôs an amazing story.
Marchand crying is the icing on the cake.

I'm happy for St. Louis, but I'm more just happy that Boston lost.
I love that they don't even bother censoring the F bombs anymore haha.
fucken rights boys
lmao Doc apologized for the Blues swearin like sailors
The fight between Sanford and Bortuzzo was the turning point of this season
This has got to be a testament to how fucked up Mike Yeo was.  For your former team to go from worst to first, and win the Cup the **very season** that they fired you.
Seeing Marchand cry made this entire series worth it.
Waited 2 periods to line up this shot

GO TIPS I fucking love Butt.
Hey another PNW local?
The title makes way more sense than I think you intended.
Nice.
Beck Warm of Tri-City Americans and Dawson Butt of Everett Silvertips.
Thank you for your service
Not all heroes have warm butts.
Any chance the Goalies name is Luke?
I needed this on this chilly night. Thank you.
If the goalie had been number 6, this would be picture of the decade.
Nice.
When you forget that you left your seat warmer on high in your car
You are doing gods work
It's efforts like this that will save the world. Respect
Nice! That's the dedication we need!!
Nice.
worth it.
Opposite of what you feel sitting at some older hockey barns
Incredible, we are all in your debt.
Go Tips
I used to work for the Americans! Beck is a great dude, hell of a goalie. A couple of years ago I got a shot of Carter Hart stretching next to Beck Warm. It was a Hart-Warming moment.
I hope someone saw Butt's wide open and made the pass
if only warm's number was 6
##GoTips!
There was a team that the local minor league team played that had two guys with the last names Sux and Dix. They liked to sit together on the bench.

359, what a crazy number.
Happiness is a.....
I was waiting for years for Dawson Butt to score a goal on Griffin Outhouse but it never happened because he got scratched most of the time.
I don't use the term "hero" often....
Silvertips also have a guy named "Gut" and when I saw them in Portland last month he sat next to Butt.  We yelled "GUTBUTT" allllllll night long
I was also at this game last night
Go tips! (Which is also an oddly relevant phrase)
Nice
Nice, if only the goalies number was 6
This is the most childish thing I‚Äôve ever seen. 

I love it

Dude, I was at that game.
Even if you waited a million years, it still would have been worth it.
Is that the great Dawson Butt? My friend and I originally found him by looking through a junior league fighting database. One year in our franchise mode we found him in the draft class and drafted him
Is that a silvertips player?! I recognize the jersey :-)

Fucking A! A Warm Butt makes things a more comfortable situation here.
Very clever. I'm sure Butt has never had anyone mock his name before.

This is usually preferred during a period. js

Scheifele hit on Evans

Too many Game 1 stretchers, man.
Shoutout to Ehlers for protecting Evans
Watch what Ehlers (27) does as players are piling up near Evans. He essentially tries holding everyone back from possibly falling onto Evans. Really classy play to look out for an opponent like that.
This was terrifying. Fuck sakes man.
Oof! That looked fucking awful. Hopefully Evans will be okay. Also, I gotta say that was a great job by the Linesman and Ehlers to keep the scrum from going on top of Evans.
Didn‚Äôt need to see another stretcher come out onto the ice. Especially with 1 min left. Fuck me. That was brutal.
[deleted]
Good on Ehlers and the linesman being a bro and making sure Evans didn't get trampled there
Gross play but props to Ehlers for being part of the kings guard
Scheifele was pissed all game. Not the way to vent out dude.
That was such a fucked up hit
Oh my god this is the hardest hit I‚Äôve seen since Campbell laid out Umberger.
What a useless fucking hit.

Sponsored by George Parros and the NHL.
That's fucking horrifying, the way he just lifelessly lays on the ice there. My god
Instead of going for the hit, if he dove forward with his stick to actually play the puck he may have actually done something.
on Evans' 25th birthday too, scheifele suspension incoming
What interests me is taking a look at Scheifle's whole third period. He looked deranged for the whole period. Guy was out for blood and that should be taken into account
That's a suspension and the Jets are in trouble
No matter how angry you get in a game, you never hit someone like that. Scheifele deserves a suspension for that. Just dirty and frustrating.
I can't believe I just saw Mark Scheifele, whom I respected VERY MUCH, do that. Frustration has a limit, that was dirty as fuck and brings the joy out of this win
If Kotkaniemi's soft check along the boards was "roughing" then this is attempted murder.
Hoping Evans makes a speedy recovery and wish him well. That said also hoping NHL drops the hammer down on Scheifele, that was absolutely disgusting!
Why is he going so high there. That's a play you make when your frustrated. Better get suspended.
Such an awful hit by one of my favourite players. Such a reckless unnecessary hit. Hate to see it.
[removed]
Happy Birthday Jake, have a dirty fucking hit.

What a gutless hit.
I've seen a lot of hits. A lot. Some good, some bad. And I love hard hard, fast playing, rough and tumble fisticuffs hockey. But twice now I've seen someone get ragdolled and stetchered off and I don't like it. This is unacceptable.
I haven‚Äôt seen this dangerous of a hit since Scott Stevens was in the league.
This hit made my christian role model mom swear if that's a good scale about how bad it was for any non-hockey fans seeing this
I had a ton of respect for Scheifele until this game.  He had the incident a few minutes before this and now this is the cherry on top.  Frick that guy.
League has an opportunity to actually do something here, yet I still feel like they're gonna find a way to fuck it up.
So Scheifele decided he didn't want to play in the series anymore? Or are we going $5k again, George?
Man, Tavares then this... A terrible playoffs so far. Two very scary injuries.
What frustrates me, and you can CLEARLY see it on the replay, is that you can see Sheifle's stick already in the crease. If he somewhat leans just a LITTLE on his stick for a poke check, he has some great odds to deflect the puck.Then there's still 50 seconds into a 1 goal game.

but instead he moves his stick BACK as Evans is sweeping it in, in order to make the hit.

So he had to avoid making the hockey play in order to make the hit, which he knew would be brutal because Evans was committed to the play. If you were to go in depth explaining what intent to injure means, I don't think it could be more clear.

&#x200B;

Edit: watched it again. It is so fucking clear at 1:15. He's so close to the puck, still has time to close the door and makes a clutch play but he gives no fuck about that.
It's a brutally predatory play for sure, and I'm getting real tired of talking about it in general (not just this one incident).

Until the NHL starts coming down hard on these types of things, it will just continue to happen. Does someone have to die before they take it seriously enough? Players need to realize that they are taking the health and safety of their opponents into their own hands, and if they fuck up then they need to bear full responsibility for their actions. Start throwing the book at them. Set a precedent if you want to get this out of the game, because unless you do, it will never leave.
Were sorry about Shief, but at least we have bro Ehlers holding people back.
Holy shit what a scummy fucking hit. Just a sore loser play taking advantage of a guy in a vulnerable position

He shouldn't see another game this series, but name's not Kadri so probably back Game 2
Great job by 27 on the Jets
Name isn't Kadri, $5000 fine and a pat on the back.

Next.
I wasn't sure if it was dirty or not originally but now watching this...

I noticed on the final replay that he actually could have maybe stopped the goal if he was trying to play the puck but he was purely intending to lay a huge hit from way before he got there 

Gross
I'm officially cheering for Montreal in this series. I always liked Scheifele. Now I think he's a piece of shit.
Brutal and reckless, wtf was that Scheiffle?

I really hope Evans is ok.
Didn‚Äôt agree with perry having to answer the bell for his collision, but if scheifle is back he better answer the bell. That shit was dirtier the Kadris hit.
Fuck Schiefele. 

Mad respect to Ehlers.

Also fuck Schiefele.

Get well soon Jake.
If Scheif isn‚Äôt suspended, the Canadiens are going to make him wish that he was
What a fucking loser
He‚Äôll get fined 10 McNuggets. What a piece of shit
Whelp, this series can go fuck itself already, what a clown show.
that might be the fastest a player has ever been skating when making a hit. Can't think of a more violent hockey hit I've ever seen, excluding the freak accident Tavares one.
never wanted to fight my television so bad
Massive respect to Ehlers
I've wanted to like Scheifle for so long, but that does it for me. Evans, who has a history of head injuries, gets knocked out cold and on his birthday. Scheifle is trash.
Scheifele needs to be done for a minimum of this series, and hopefully for even longer.   That was disgusting.
I hate that this was the ending of the game. Bad enough to see the EN put away the hype of that ending to the game but just brutal. Scheifele should be suspended. I'm no expert on length and the DoPS is a joke and crapshoot at best but I would not be opposed to any length of suspension for the rest of playoffs.
That was a disgusting, violent hit. He shouldn‚Äôt play again this series, but if he does because DoPS sucks, I hope Weber feeds him his lunch in a fight, because that was absolutely chickenshit.
Just saw this analysis. Looks like scheifele slows down....to lineup a hit...when he could have gone full speed to try and prevent the goal.

It‚Äôs almost like he gave up trying to prevent Evans from scoring and lining him up for the hit while he was most vulnerable (turning towards the net to score).

Absolutely the dirtiest play of the playoffs. Piece of shit.
I'm a Jets fan and I cannot stand when people do shit like what Scheifele did. I really hope he's out for the rest of the season. Zero reason for hits like that.
Not gonna lie when I read Scheifele laid a heavy hit that resulted in an injury I expected it to be an unfortunate accident but that shit was super predatory.
To the clowns on Instagram saying ‚Äúkeep your head up its hockey‚Äù... Scheifele knew exactly what he was doing on that hit, didnt even attempt to play the puck and went full on at a defenseless player. Uncalled for and he knows that hit was intended to hurt Evans.
As a Jets fan, I am deeply disappointed and remorseful over Scheifeles play. Like I loved the guy and was even gonna buy his jersey....but now I don‚Äôt even want to watch the rest of the series. Horrible play from normally a clean player. Hope he gets suspended for the rest of the series. I don‚Äôt like it but that‚Äôs what we would want if Gally or anyone else ran one of our boys like that. I‚Äôm just sad....I hope and pray Evans is okay
100% intentional! Get this dude out of the playoffs!
dirty fucking coward
Didn‚Äôt even go for the puck. What a gross play.
Whooooole lot of people in here who seem to forget that charging exists.
What a dirty fucking hit. He makes zero attempt to play the puck and just takes Evans' fucking head off by the time the goal was pretty much inevitable. If he Schiefele doesn't get suspended for that I will puke my guts out.
Scheifele after that hit has the audacity to be upset about being kicked out of the game instead of being concerned for the human being he may of killed. Hockey is truly fucked up sometimes.
This was absolutely deliberate. He‚Äôs a marked man for sure now.
Can we all agree that the ‚Äúcoasting‚Äù defense on shitty hits is the dumbest, most low-iq bullshit ever. Like, let me skate full speed and then not move my feet on a near frictionless surface as if that‚Äôll slow my momentum that I already built up. 

That was a fucking ridiculous hit.
Totally disgusting hit, hope he gets a massive suspension. Nothing but pure intent to injure. Coward
Ehlers is such a good guy, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he beat the fuck out of Scheifele in the parking lot after the game for this
Fuck Scheifele. What a piece of shit.
Spineless hit by Scheifele. Weber should have the same opportunity, since the league operates on an eye for an eye policy
Anyone that plays hockey can understand that this is a scummy hit. 

First of all, watch the video again and tell me Scheifele couldn‚Äôt poke the puck and have a better chance at preventing that goal. He chose to hit, regardless of his reasoning, and his coach and team should be mad not only that he chose to be a tough guy and go for the body instead of the more sensible poke, but that he might be taken out for a few games from the series screwing his team twice, double fisted. 

Secondly, this just violates the code that hockey players have which is genuine respect of the game and the human beings playing it. That is an incredibly vulnerable spot to be in from the shooters standpoint and regardless of him putting himself there or playoff hockey, you don‚Äôt steam roll someone full speed like that in that kind of position. That is how people get hurt and in the end, as much as people on here like to make it out to be more, it is just a game and not worth inflicting possible life long serious damage on somebody. The guilt of doing that will be with you your whole life and all for what? To make a statement? This is disgraceful.
He doesn't even try to play the puck... Just goes right for the hit, knowing that puck is going in anyways. That's just a frustrated player taking it out on the other team in the dying seconds of game 1. Anyone saying that's "just a hard, clean hit" needs to get their head checked and show me where Mark even tries to go for the puck that's already crossing the crease. Gross.
That was a brain dead play by Scheifele, and not only the fact that it was a dirty hit. Scheifele had a very clear chance had he went for the puck instead of the hit, he could have prevented the goal. His stick was inches away from the puck before throwing the hit without considering the fact he wasn‚Äôt stretching his stick out at all. With 56 seconds left they still had a solid chance to come back and tie the game, Scheifele was roughing after whistles all game, he made up his mind about the hit a long time before the play even developed.
Horrible. I'd give that a double digit suspension, but I know it's probably not going to happen.
I feel like in situations like this, with the score the way it is, just call off the rest of the game. The Habs dont need 5 minutes of PP time, the game ending should be punishment for the offending team.
Trash.
Scheifele definitely could have stopped that goal if he went for the puck instead. In the slow motion, you can observe that his stick is positioned tucked back as he lined up the hit, and then as the puck comes around the post, the stick retreats even further as the hit commences.

If he instead reached out his stick while going at that speed, then it would be unlikely the puck makes it in. Instead, Scheifele injures Evan instead and gets suspended. His goal wasn't to win the game since he felt like it was lost already, and so his goal was to hurt the other team.

The point of all these rule changes for the past decade, since the days of Matt Cooke over a decade ago, has slowly culminated towards the elimination of hits to the head regardless of the circumstances, right? In the old game, this might be a minor or no more than a major. Fast forward over decades of destroyed careers and lives, and the game is supposed to be past this. Apparently, not.

Edit: He immediately looks for the retaliation after the hit for a reason.
jesus christ that‚Äôs a thick suspension incoming
Garbage hit what the fuck Scheif
Predatory as fuck. Scheifele should be done from this series.
Was watching with my roommate (lifelong hockey player) and he was legit shocked into silence after the hit. I know nothing, but I know getting ragdolled is never good. Christ, that was bad.
I am straight up disgusted, not only is this risking someone's life and career, but ending it off with "what did I do????" face is just disgusting.
Fuck Mark Scheifele.
the NHL: advocates for vicious dangerous hits

2 players lie lifeless on the ice within 2 weeks. The NHL: *surprised pikachu face*
That‚Äôs dirty as hell. He better be done for a few games, if not the rest of the series.
if scheifele somehow isn‚Äôt suspended for the rest of this series, he is gonna get murdered the next time he steps on the ice
First couple times I saw this play I thought it was just a dude trying to make a play to keep the game alive. After rewatching it, yea he had no intention of playing the puck, was just gunning for the hit
Great for Ehlers to be protecting Evans, why the fuck isn't Schief making an effort to direct the scrum away from Evans. Even after everyone gives him space he looks like he's already trying to make his case to someone.

Fucking gross.
Scheifele was out there looking pissed all game, not particularly surprised. I just hope Evans will be ok.
worst part is shuffle could have stopped the goal. fucking scumbag
The definition of unnecessary
Fucking disgusting hit but as a Habs fan, mad respect to Ehlers for protecting Evans Body from the scrum. Terrible, terrible hit
Dude what a fucking dirty hit. Hopefully the wheel lands on some justice.
The first several times I watched this I wanted to defend Scheifele because, first, he was trying to prevent a goal, and second, he didn't really leave his feet until after contact. But the more I watch it, the worse it looks. No attempt whatsoever to the play the puck, and he follows through pretty good up high with his shoulder. Dangerous hit, and avoidable whether he's trying to prevent a goal or not. 

I still don't think this is an "intent to injure" situation, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a bad hit and should get a few games at least. And as hard as it is to have faith in the DoPS, I'd be shocked if he isn't suspended just due to the severity of the injury. 

Hope Evans is ok. What a shitty fucking way to end a game.
So there‚Äôs a minute left in the game, MTL is up by 1; the puck is in WPG‚Äôs end, Evans has a gimme goal.  Scheifele‚Äôs soul intent was to hurt Evans, no ifs ands or buts.  Scheifele needs to be gone for the rest of the series or the rest of the playoffs, if not Weber is going to wear Scheifele‚Äôs skin like a suit if he gets his hands on him
What a piece of trash.
We keep seeing these henious plays. Recently Tom Wilson, Reeves, now Scheifele.

The league needs to take a step to actually discourage players from taking cheap shots. These random wheel spins arent lessening these stretchering hits with pure intent to injure. Nobody wants to see this bullshit, the league needs to smarten up.
What's the suspension gonna be for? Headshot? Or what?
Scum
i was told i clearly never played hockey if i think players actively try to injure eachother

Omg I love that the title is sarcastic. I clicked it to reluctantly watch a talented player that I hate win a game, but I joyfully got to watch him fail. 

Thank you for this gift.
This is why you don't turn off games, Flyers were down 5-2 in the 2nd period and it ends like this. Craziest game of the year
For the people from r/all:

A shootout is basically like penalty kicks in soccer, where teams take turns on breakaways trying to score. It‚Äôs 3 rounds, and if it‚Äôs still tied in goals then it goes to extra rounds. If the team going first scores in these rounds, then the team going second gets a chance to tie it up and keep the shootout going. If the team going first doesn‚Äôt score but the team going second does, they win right there.

Brad Marchand is one of the best players in the league. This is basically like Tiger Woods swinging his tee shot and missing the ball completely. It almost never happens for a player to just miss the puck.

EDIT: This is getting more visibility, so clarification. In a shootout, you‚Äôre not allowed to stop or go backwards, and your attempt starts as soon as you touch the puck. Therefore, if you lose possession of the puck and it‚Äôs behind you, your attempt is over. Since Marchand barely touched the puck, moving it two whole inches counted as his go.

MORE EDITS to answer more questions:

- Philadelphia got a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù out of this because winning the shootout counts as 1 goal. Since Philadelphia went first and scored, Marchand had to score for Boston to keep the shootout alive, and he didn‚Äôt, so Philadelphia won.

- People in this comment section are so delighted that Marchand missed specifically because Brad Marchand is one of the most hated players in the NHL.

Imagine. You're Brad Marchand. Everyone hates you, but your team and your fans adore you. You're having a great year. Your team goes into a shoot out, it's getting to the wire. You're in the 5th round and it's your turn to go up. The other team scored so now you must to continue the game. You get on the ice, you build up speed. You know this is your moment. You near the puck and barely brush it and leave it behind. It counts as a shot and your team loses. You blew everything. Gritty is in the stands behind you ecstatic. Gritty goes home with your wife. You're now homeless. You have no money. Your ex wife took everything in the divorce and now Gritty is sleeping in your bed.

I've only watched it like 25 times so far. So amazing.
Great title
We'll get to enjoy this on blooper reels for the next 30 years, absolutely delicious way to end the game.
The Boston Bruins and blowing a three goal lead to Philadelphia, what a classic combo.
100+ Awards within 2 hours, 20.000+ Upvotes, Top post on the Frontpage, god /r/hockey hates this guy with a passion, I'm glad we can all agree on something today, what a beautiful day!
What a shootout ending. That one's going to be on repeat for a lot of people...
Hook this shit to my veins.
This is our team in the shootout, summed up in one play
Wicked smaht!
[Gritty lives for your shame](https://i.imgur.com/cbKNNSx.jpg)
Brad won't sleep well tonight lmao
This is an ultimate karma punch in the face. Ridiculed infront of thousands.
I mean, fuck the shootout, but this has to be the worst attempt ever hahaha
#Fuck Brad Marchand!
LICK THE PUCK NEXT TIME
Goal of the year candidate for sure
I saw this live and I immidiately knew this is going to be an epic meme on r/hockey.
LOL and the title to go with it
Gritty waves Marchand goodbye
Couldn't have happened to a better guy. Really heartbroken over this.
r/all we did it, Reddit
I never thought I could hear an entire subreddit collectively ejaculate at the same time.
They call that the *weasel*
Lmao
I'm going to assume by the title we finally won a shootout.

"his nose got in the way"
Top post on r/all and 100+ awards

My goodness lol
You can‚Äôt miss your shot in a shootout if you don‚Äôt take it.

*taps head*
The hockey world rejoices!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Couldnt have happened to a better guy
I dont even get hockey and I'm embarrassed for dude.
I'm here from /r/all and have no idea what's just fucking kidding fuck Brad Marchand.
no bigger piece of shit in the nhl deserves that more.
Even though I need Philly to lose so my boys can take that playoff spot (no hard feelings flyer bros, our division is just fucking insane this year)....

This is worth it. 

Haha, fuck Marchand
This is going to be voted as the best post of the decade in 2029. Calling it.
I don't think you could touch a puck softer than that while moving that fast if you were trying to do it. It's honestly impressive.
A+ title. 

I had resigned myself to watching Marchand being filthy good and instead was delighted with that piece of history!
[deleted]
I read the title and immediately thought, "Please let this be an epic fuck up."
>27 Crying Marchands

Seems about right
Waiting on Jomboy here. "Brad Marchand misses the puck: a breakdown."
I think r/hockey just collectively nutted
This was so good, I‚Äôm upvoting with my porn account
*Brad Marchand*


*20k upvotes*


*sees Philly had already scored that round*

Oh yeah, it‚Äôs all coming together
I do not think it's possible to touch the puck any less and still actually touch the puck.

If you asked a player to try that 100 times, I don't think they do it more than once or twice.

That takes some serious skill on Marchand's part.

Oh my karma....
Just commenting to be a part of history
So glad I caught this live.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Now we just need a parody in the form of those rewinding "What if?" ads.

Here's how far he moved.  This is so great.

Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy
LOL this had me dying. In Philly of all places too. This will live in infamy. I would say poor guy, but...Marchand.
[deleted]
I love seeing a piece of shit - eat shit.

God, I fucking hate that slew-footing turd sandwich.
[I love it](https://i.imgur.com/bxS6xJt.jpg)
Does this mean we can finally quit talking about Tkachuk/Kassian? 

Cant imagine how that must feel to do that in front of so many at such an important moment, yikes
This. Makes. Me. So. Happy.
I just went through every comment and upvoted like crazy. You all deserve it for reacting with the proper amount of glee.
r/titleporn

I almost didn‚Äôt click this based on the title.. but all the awards had me suspicious enough.
I saw the amount of the awards, and my first thought was: "Oh, this is going to be good.".

It was.
"Goddamn, as a Habs fan I hate Marchand. But, he does have skill and so I guess I can enjoy watching this beauty of a shootout goal..."  
_Watches clip, pleasant surprise of Marchand fucking up_  
"My God. It's beautiful."
This is the #9 highest rated post in /r/hockey history, as of this comment

Edit: it settled at #4.
Watched this live and nearly pissed on my cat's asshole in laughter lmao
Couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better player. God what a beautiful ending to that shootout.
I have to listen to Jack Edwards call on that
I love that r/hockey is united in our Marchand hate.
Beautiful ending
SWING AND A MISS!
RIGHT INTO MY VEINS. Fuck this is better than anything i've watched this decade.
You hate to see it
haha, suck on that, you rat faced jack ass.
imagine if this happened in boston
Not that it really matters but they also lost the league lead by missing out on that point.
oh my fucking god......
Lmao Marchand you fucking donkey!
You son of a bitch, you got me.
I saw the comment/time of post ratio and knew this was gonna be a good one lol
I need to hear Jack Edwards call this.
I love the sad Marchand reprise he gives with the glove there at his mouth.
I have no actual comment. I just want to be a part of history.
That's the "line change with 9 seconds left" of shootout attempts
At least Dennis Wideman got to the net
@ Sharks game last night, read the first letter of each word

I saw this message and leaned over to my pops and said, ‚Äúwhat a weirdly structured sentence.. also who the fuck uses imbibe???‚Äù You mad man.
*Sigh*‚Ä¶ fuck. 

They got us.
Me, an idiot: Fuck... the... Knicks? Haha yeah man totally. Knicks suck!
It is my birthday today so to celebrate, my friends and I went to the ducks game last night. With a 10+ ticket purchase you get to have a message of your choice put up on the jumbotron. I couldn't let a golden opportunity go to waste.
if there‚Äôs a Jumbotron HOF, this would get first ballot votes no problem

Hey /u/bharms27,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
I look forward to Barstool stealing this and posting it.

"*This fans brilliant roast of an NHL team went completely unnoticed! Click here to see it!*"
Bruuuuh bunch of madlad fishes
90% chance the Knights are gonna steal this idea next year for their jumbotron
The content I come to r/hockey for
Fuck The Knig Hts?

Edit: Jesus christ im stupid. I thought it was supposed to say Fuck the Kings.

Edit 2 Electric Boogaloo: who guilded this? Jesus of course my first guilded comment would be me making a dumbass of myself.
This is beautiful
holy fuck
We've now fully solidified the Sharks-Knights rivalry.
The most surprising thing since VGK arrived in the league: How much I like and appreciate the Sharks
off topic but damn the food at sap center is good
I haven't seen a sweet acrostic since grad school. Noice.

Stay classy, San Jose.
Holy shit 10-7‚Äôd em
‚ÄòNow Imbibe Generously‚Äô is the most jammed in statement of all time
It was you!?! You legend üôå
Based Sharks
hot damn we made it to r/all, knights/sharks is the talk of the town again (moreso us missing the playoffs but regardless lol)

grats OP
This is legendary
Sharks about to go on summer vacay
You‚Äôre an absolute, certified r/MadLads
lol, touch√©. one good thing about us missing the playoffs is it reignited the rivalry against yall and our shared distaste for deboer and spott
lmao. this is actually pretty funny. well played sharks. see ya next season
as a knights fan i respect this. lol it's quality level trolling. way better than 99% of the slop that gets thrown up on r/nhl
Slow clap
Shoutout to hockey. The only league where this kind of shit happens. lol
Damn op, well done!
LMFAO, OP you're a legend
This has gone viral. Well played - Sincerely, a Knights fan
Brutal, savage, wrecked. Absolutely dunked on.
I missed the K and shit almost got real for a second.
How to bring Kings, Ducks, and Sharks fans together.
If those Vegas fans could read, they would be very upset
What is the Sharks-Kings rivalry then, chopped liver?
I can‚Äôt tell if someone is gonna get fired or promoted
I am Impressed, and I applaud you sir. Actually pretty hilarious.
We are but peons not even worthy to walk in your shadow.
As a vegas fan, thank you for a quality troll
Fuck the knights üòØ
I fucking hate you you brilliant bastard. Happy birthday!!!
As a Knights fan I‚Äôm not even mad. This is some classy shit
Fuck you shoresy!
Yesssssssssssssssss. Sharks for life.
I'm definitely behind, when the hell was it suddenly popular for everyone to universally hate Vegas
FUCK THE KNIGHTS. SAVAGE.
That‚Äôs so fucking hockey üëå
Their jumbotron guy is definitely a mod in r/shitposting
I need a Sharks jersey now
Lol fantastic.
Yeah I like the clever hiding of the secret message with the first letter of each word because NOBODY on this planet would come up with a word salad message like was displayed on the scoreboard without something else to it.
F U C K  T H E  K N I G H T S
so reading it letter-by-letter, my brain said *fuck the ka-nigh-its* and so then it automatically turned into Monty Python which, I have to be honest, made it even better.
Omg amazing.
I must admit I can‚Äôt figure out the hidden message, help please
I may be Vegas fan. But this is great. Well done OP well done üèíüèíüèí
H I S T O R I C
For once the word Epic to describe something fits appropriately
Fucking legend who did that. They have no chill
Classy
Whoever thought that up; bravo, sir/madam.
Excellent work. Now if only someone can update us on the Sam, Mariah, and Jason saga, my day would be complete.

I went to an aquarium in Vegas back in 2019 when they were playing the sharks in the playoffs and there were all these signs near the shark tanks like "dear San Jose Sharks, please change your name, you're embarrassing the rest of us - sincerely, the Sharks".

Love this new rivalry
clever as hell‚Ä¶ I love this sort of stuff
Love to see the shark tank on r/all
Lmao. I‚Äôm not even mad. Well done.
Love it. also happy birthday. Also flair check... again.....
Niceeee... I am an Avs fan so I got nothing to add here but... niceee
That‚Äôs fucking amazing
Fuck the knights
Fuck the knights

I seriously had to type that out
If that's real, that's the coolest thing I've seen in scrolling on Reddit for 1 hour today.
Get fucking meme‚Äôd on Vegas holy shit lmao
The East has more competitive teams, but the West has the spiciest memes
The 1 sharks fan who released it is like Im on the way to reddit
Wow I‚Äôm slow
‚ÄúFuck The Knights‚Äù - Yes
[Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/10/schwarzenegger-sticks-it-to-assemblyman-acrostic-style/29206/).
Sus
NHL Newbie here, why people are hating the Knights?
Fans of 19 OHL teams right now getting some creative ideas ready.
Well done, good and faithful servant.
This was absolutely legendary
Lol. I hate both teams but that‚Äôs hilarious.
How indigo should the oval rink's ice change?
Knights never illustrate good humor towards poor ole worthless evil rivals.
LMFAO W
Real shit.

Why does basically *all* of hockey hate Vegas? Like, what did they do?
That's amazing, great catch
Fuck the knights
Genius.
lol, how incredibly salty! Thank you for the consideration
SoCal hockey ü§ù NorCal hockey 

Fuck the Knights
Unpopular opinion coming, but DAE think Vegas bad now?!
I assume they were play Vegas?
Fuck The Knights!
Vegas Golden Showers.
You sir are the hero the pacific division deserves. Fuck the knights!
Some 11th grader got an internship running the Jumbotron and made the most of it.
Wtf did we do! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hiw do people notice this sh1t? I would never notice it.

Do ppl actually look for this? Serious beautiful mind sh1t goingon
Props where it's due, lose to VGK on the scoreboard 11 of last 12 and like 72% of the time overall, but definitely 1-0 on the jumbotron!
Lmao nice one
That‚Äôs awesome
Don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre saying fuck them. If they didn‚Äôt choke every fucking time in the post season it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. 

Am a sharks fan since they were the Oakland Seals
Probably a coincidence üôÉ
I initially missed the K, stopped at the G, and came to the comments like ‚Äúwhat the fuck?!‚Äù
Geesh! That is 100% NOT something you want to spell out loud. Do this one in your head!
Something all hockey fans can agree on
This is incredible OP.

God damn I love hockey.
fuck the knights
Why the Knights hate from the Sharks? They have some kind of history?
F U C K  T H E  K N I G H T S
Absolutely amazing
I welcome the Sharks' hatred, and this kind of chirping can be fun...

but god knows if it were the other way around the general response would be "omg Vegas is so petty" and "stay classy, Vegas"
But they‚Äôre playing the ducks
Ok? But they are playing Anaheim not Vegas.
**FUCK THE kNIGHTS**

For anyone else who was trying to work out what FUCK THEKNIGHTS meant.
I guess you gotta get your digs in where you can, when your play on the ice doesn‚Äôt do the talking. Hey, you got that one President‚Äôs Trophy though, right?
San Jose Sharts posting cringe, sounds about right
Rent free
wtf? Fuck The Knig, Hts?

edit: ah fuck the knights, im a dumbass
Freakin unreal! Clever! Knowing that hockey enthusiasts‚Äô keen nature is getting hyped to shenanigans
It‚Äôs a but much, no?
Go KNIGHTS Go!!
The Tampa Bay Lightning have been eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs after being swept by the Columbus Blue Jackets

62 regular season wins

0 playoff wins
I always pictured our first series win as a dramatic Game 7 over Pittsburgh but I guess this is ok too
LOL who gets swept in the first round????
Who had the Blue Jackets sweeping the Lightning in their pool?  Anyone?

YOU FUCKING LIAR
/r/CatastrophicFailure

EDIT: [I couldn't resist.](https://streamable.com/2bqe0) Credit to /u/twistedlogicx for the highlights.
Just like we all predicted
By far the biggest first round upset in the history of the NHL. Kudos to the Jackets they‚Äôre playing some great hockey!
Let's look at the stats from this season

Devils

* 0 playoff wins

* Won draft lottery

Lightning

* 0 playoff wins

* Not even in draft lottery

Who really had the better season?
President‚Äôs Tr0-4hy
Two regular season points separated Jarmo Kek√§l√§inen from looking like a complete idiot and completely changing a franchise.

Mad respect for the balls. Cheers to you Columbus. Congrats, but dont stop there. Go get it.
Everyone: Lightning in 4

The Tampa Bay Lightning were the first team to qualify for playoffs. Now they are the first team out.
SWEEP. Prepare to be memed for the next 10 years Tampa.
So next time I should flip a coin when I make my brackets, got it.
["Look at how they massacred my boy"](https://i.imgur.com/hDgTpft.png)
THE COIN WAS RIGHT
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Lightning

&#x200B;

You now have the worst/most embarrassing playoff performance in the history of Hockey! Perhaps even in world sporting history!

&#x200B;

You will be continually reminded of this fact for the rest of eternity.
We dropped from first in the entire league to 27th but at least we didn't choke as hard as the Lightning
WILDCARD BITCHES

YEEEEEEEHHHHAAAAAAAWWWWW
This is the biggest upset in NHL history
GODDAMNIT BOBROVSKY YOU'RE A LOOSE CANNON BUT I'D BE A DAMNED LIAR IF I SAID I DIDN'T RESPECT YOU. YOU'LL MAKE SERGEANT FOR THIS.
Eat your own hat u/WMino
Thanks in advance Tampa

-other teams losing in the first round after being favourites to win
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of brackets suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
I'm sure there'll be lots of memes.  But I'm just happy for the Blue Jackets fans.  20 years without any playoff success, and what a way to break through.
This is why the NHL playoffs are the best post season in sports.
What the fuck just happened?
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exaggerating, that is the biggest first round series upset in sports history.
Historic season.  Historic exit.
TRUST THE COIN
FIFO
To the people who said they were going to eat assorted things, time to pay the man
THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY FUCKING LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GIVE ME ALL THE MEMES

If you'd have told me a month ago that the Pens would get swept in the first round, I'd have said "ehhh, maybe but probably not"

If you'd have told me a month ago that the *Bolts* would get swept in the first round, by CBJ, I would have punched you straight in the mouth.
https://imgur.com/9Or2M6G
Going to be an awkward awards show when Cooper wins the Jack Adams, Kuch gets the Hart, Vas gets the Vezina ... eek
Where were you when the Blue Jackets swept the Bolts? I was here, patiently awaiting memes.
I was there at the beginning. I remember watching the press conference announcing CBJ. I‚Äôve been to so, so many games throughout the years. Usually losses, but we still cheered and supported.

I remember making the playoffs for the first time and getting destroyed by the red wings.

I remember winning our first playoff game and how sweet that was.

I remember our epic win streak a few years back and how disappointingly that season ended.

For me, this is truly historic. It feels like we already won the cup.

One of the best moments in my life.

I‚Äôll never forget this.

Just. Wow. 

Wiping tears from my eyes. 

Wow.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and all the awesome comments!
The regular season exists solely to cause Edmonton Oilers fans to contemplate suicide.

It serves no other purpose.

Hey tampa fans. There is no shame stepping away from hockey for a little. 

Its going to sting for a bit but its just a game and the frustration you feel will go away. 

It not your fault. And dont blame anyone except who was involved. Its easy to take your anger out 

Good luck next year

This is the first time in Vegas Golden Knights' history that a #1 seed was swept in the first round
I hope this makes teams go out and sell the farm every deadline
I can't tell you how much this win means to me. I grew up in Columbus and just started watching Hockey 10 mins ago.

Yzerman stepping down at the beginning of the year makes sense now
Cannon good. 

Bolt bad. 

upvote pls
#1 on r/all in under 15 minutes. Absolutely incredible
This series is just a very elaborate ad for the new Space Jam movie
Has this big of a flop in the playoffs ever happened? A team with a historically amazing regular season just... not showing up?
speechless. To win was one thing, to sweep shows that columbus really wanted it that much more
Stamkos Choking > Ovi Choking

EDIT:  I was more talking about the endless narrative that Ovi couldn't get it done despite the fact that he could still produce.  Stamkos just likes to go on vacation early when April comes around.

This thread is a non stop train to the top of r/all and the best r/hockey all time
Hi r/all, OutOfTheLoop? The Tampa Bay Lightning came into the Stanely Cup Playoffs with a tied record for best regular season wins with 62 out of 82, entering with the first seed bracket. Columbus Blue Jackets just barely made it into the playoffs,.securing their 8th seed place at the last minute on their last couple of regular season games. The 8th seed Columbus have just swept their series with Tampa 4 games to 0, against a Tampa team considered the best in the post cap era. One of the biggest, if not *the* biggest upsets in NHL history.
I'm just happy Kucherov doesn't get to play any more hockey.
As I sit here in my year 1, original Ron Tugnutt jersey, staring at the final score in disbelief, tears forming in my eyes, I now understand the meaning of sports. My four year old, who I introduced to hockey just this year, is jumping up and down in sheer, genuine joy. Even my wife, who is normally stoic by nature, is ecstatic.

Twenty years without a playoff series win is the line people are using as another reason why this is so historic. But that's only half of the story. Relative to other franchises in every sport, that's not too terrible from a timeline perspective. What makes this historic for me as a fan is that it's our first playoff series win in our entire existence.

I feel like we won the Stanley Cup tonight. That may seem ridiculous to fans of more prestigious clubs as they count the accomplishments of their teams' histories. But for me, this one tiny blip of success is a mountain of joy that I will remember for the rest of my life.
Holy shit

Never seen anything like that
Tampa Bay locked their sub LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No disrespect to the jackets, I'm a firm believer that Columbus sweeping them is a huge fluke and robs the Lightning of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few days in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the Lightning play great hockey it's just not fair.

If the Lightning lose again I will face that the Jackets deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Lightning and the NHL.

Tampa's historic season was all 4-0

As a native Columbus, Ohio citizen:


Fuck I guess I gotta watch hockey now

While we are all congratulating Columbus, let's not forget to also congratulate Tampa Bay for their historic regular season and their even more historic playoff run.
They should redo the series in case it was just a big fluke^^/s
Fade me, shame me, I am committing toaster bath.
Congrats Blue Jacket fans.  This has to feel incredible after everyone was writing you guys off before the series even started.

I'm legitimately speechless, but you guys did it!
I cannot think of a more shocking series outcome in NHL history, at least not recent history.

Is this the biggest collapse in sports history?

Record setting season followed by being swept by a wildcard team in the first round

SWEEP THOSE FLAIRS
Not even Notre Dame could steal the title for worst collapse of the week.
It's okay Lightning fans, we Canucks fans know how you feel after winning the presidents trophy in 2012. Oh wait nvm we didn't get swept LMAO.
Everyone‚Äôs bracket is now fucked. If anyone tells you there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt, they‚Äôre lying.
[deleted]
Well, that was embarrassing.
I haven‚Äôt seen High St. like this since OSU won the Natty. Please don‚Äôt mace us tonight, Columbus PD.
In a record setting season for the Lightning, they go out in historic fashion as the first time to ever be swept in the first round after winning the President's Trophy!

Congrats guy!
Biggest upset in NHL History?
Conglaturations from Urinatingtree coming any day now...

Congratulations Tampa! You get a special addition to your flair! Just not the one you wanted.
