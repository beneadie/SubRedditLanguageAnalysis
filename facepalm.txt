Cops pepper sprayed their own Senator without realizing he's an authority figure

Actually they did know. 


He's given interviews where he explained how he id'd himself before getting sprayed
How is that guy in the white shirt wearing his mask? Wtf
That cop behind him didn‚Äôt even fully unfold his N95...
the only authority they recognize is their own.

nvm that is borrowed.
[removed]
That‚Äôs the picture that will get him elected in every campaign he runs for.
It seems their solution to police brutality is more police brutality. They're doubling down on something that clearly isn't working.
This is scary. 

Hong Kong riots started started around 6 months ago and it felt like a world away for America, but here we are.
How is it even legal for the police to pepper spray people who are not armed or violent?

The first amendment guarantees citizens the right to assemble.

Every one of these cops should be shitcanned.
I feel like everyone on earth is in the Bad Place right now.

Edit: I feel like some people are not getting the reference. It was meant to be a light heartened joke about a show.

Edit #2. This was never meant to be about the riots specifically. Therefore, your living outside America isn‚Äôt relevant. Again, it was a lighthearted joke about how things are going in the world. Riots, pandemic, global warming, natural disasters, fires, etc.

Perfect.
I'm Dutch and I'm trying to understand the position police officers have in the US. It seems to me they answer to no one, they have no boss, are not accountable for anything and they see the general population as the enemy. To me that sounds a lot like a hostile, occupying force. A domestic enemy.
It shouldn‚Äôt fucking matter who he is. They just attacked a peaceful protester. It‚Äôs happening across the entire country and I can‚Äôt believe people aren‚Äôt more outraged.
They don't know who he is, and they don't care. They're literally drive-by pepper spraying and beating the shit out of bystanders. Whether or not you're an elected official means nothing to the cops.
We investigated ourselves and found no evidence of wrongdoing.
[deleted]
They are arresting based on color, not status. Duh.
If whoever is reporting this as misinformation wants to provide a source, be our guest.
Isn‚Äôt it obvious? Certain police departments are running their own show now, and EVERYONE is in their way.
There is so much wrong with this that doesn't need to be said. That said, is the mall cop version of trump wearing a woman's pad as a face shield?
He went there specifically to try and keep the peace.

They should make all chief of police an elected position that can be recalled. If the chief can‚Äôt keep their officers in line, then they should take responsibility.
This is starting to be a #metoo movement but for police violence.  And now that politicians tasted the police methods, things will start to change soon..
cops: "well he's black isn't he?"
Without realizing he's a person\*
Let‚Äôs not pretend they didn‚Äôt know who they were. They just don‚Äôt care.
It‚Äôs basically cops vs everyone at this point.  It‚Äôs going to get bad but this shit has been brewing a long time.  If every American isn‚Äôt outraged at the sight of this shit, I don‚Äôt know how to persuade you.
They attacked him because he is black. It is what it is: disgusting.
At the start of this I thought cops can't be that bad. I am beginning to no longer have the same opinion
Since OP doesn't link to an article: 

http://bronx.news12.com/story/42192118/state-senator-says-he-was-pepper-sprayed-handcuffed-at-barclays-protest
Didn't he openly state he was their senator?
Jusus fucking Christ, America!

i don‚Äôt t understand why all these cops are doing this shit to peaceful protesters. its literally in the first amendment that you have a right to protest. i guess the constitution doesn‚Äôt fucking matter any more now does it.
Despite this evidence of abuse, they're still going to continue hiring cops with IQ less than 100, and not screening out the power-tripping psychos.

Well, the big problem is exactly how do we change a broken system Protesting is not enough, it is just a drive to try to make it happen. But how it will happen is open. We can't just allow change to be set by comfortable cliques behind closed doors. Maybe we need open hearings and mandated allowing public inputs, rules changes, internal culture changes, and punishment for breaking rules. A problem then will be criminals deliberately taunting LEOs, but cameras can help on that.
He¬¥s black so he is bad. police logic at it¬¥s best.
Dem cops is bout to get der asses stomped
How the fuck does someone accomplish this?
All they saw was his skin color.
In a very darkly comedic way, it's fun to watch the police repeatedly stomp on their own cocks.
Oh boy what a blunder.
Jesus Christ America are you determined to be the laughing stock of the planet in 2020 or what.
I'm glad they're at the protests, and I'm even happier that they're getting pepper sprayed. Actions like that increase the likelihood of change, both legislatively and procedurally.
*sigh*. So do we go the hypermilitaristic route with these cops or just wait it out?
Pretty crazy how even the leaders of these states are powerless to do shit about cops. You might see one or two get fired every now and then but nothing systemically changes.

Maybe the cops just have databanks of blackmail lmfao
"That's what he gets for being black."

That's the new GOP motto, the new police state motto, and the new MAGA motto.

I can't believe things are getting this bad in America.  Trump needs to man up and do a speech soon, trying to calm the nation, and start us on a path to healing.

I don't think he has it in him though.  He has zero empathy.

This is the best title of the year
That one cop that was lying down was just resting.  The others wouldn't let him lie down.  They should be locked up for resisting a rest.
‚ÄúYou have no Power here.‚Äù

When you have been through a week of Wacken, then you learn to accept the mud as your friend rather than your enemy.

THE MUD WIZARD!
[Mold Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mold-earth) that‚Äôs a pretty basic but clearly highly effective cantrip :P
Twice they thought they had outsmarted the wizard by throwing away the pages he had torn from the Grimoire of Squelch, but in the end he had memorised the spells required to walk atop the bog, and they sank beneath the mire.
You can tell it's not the States because the Wizard hasn't been tazed or shot.
Grew up on farm, lots of mud.

There is a way of walking through mud, how you step, move the foot that keeps you from losing your boots.

You do not get trapped in the mud.

As a 11 year old watching my Mom walk across the mud and I got 3 steps and lost a boot, I was quite irrate.

She then taught me how to move through it 

She knew I had to lose a boot, and her not before I would learn. As I was a smart ass.
And they were laughing at him at first for getting a Ph. D. in Mudology instead of Thaumaturgy. Who's laughing now?

Some people here are commenting with very out of context information.   

First, this protest is against power company RWE clearing the village of L√ºtzerath in the west of Germany for mining lignite.   

Lignite mining has been a thing in Germany for decades and apart from the lagerst√§tten in the West there are more in central Germany near Leipzig and in the East in Lusatia/ Lausitz.    

Before Power Company Rewe got the permission to clear L√ºtzerath to mine lignite there, they signed a deal with the government saving another 5 villages from being destroyed and also a set end date for the mining of lignite in the area in 2030. They‚Äôve also bought the whole place and got everyone previously living in L√ºtzerath a new home in the neighbouring city. You could criticise the deal (for example why set the date for the end of mining so late, lignite mining is dying anyway because it‚Äôs not as profitable anymore), but in the end it was a set contract. Mining the coal under L√ºtzerath will not make much of a difference, if at all, in the emission of CO2 because of emission certificate trading - if RWE doesn‚Äôt buy the certificates to mine in L√ºtzerath some other company will buy them and mine elsewhere (or rather, use the certificates to produce emissions). L√ºtzerath being mined or not will not make a difference.    

Still, I think the protests are important and have a point - we have to end lignite mining as fast as possible or reduce it to absolutely necessary minimum and massively increase investing in new energies and nuclear.   

This protest in particular has absolutely nothing to do with nuclear energy though so all the comments here about that are a bit confusing.
A wizard is never late, he arrives precisely when he means too.
I thought the mud wizard part was a joke üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Is this where that coal mine is that is swallowing up towns? I‚Äôve been reading about it in the news here in Australia.
This is hilarious
The Mud Wizard of L√ºtzerath

&#x200B;

In a village small and neat,

Nestled in a vast and muddy seat,

There lived a wizard strong and bold,

The Mighty Mud Wizard, stories told.

With piercing eyes and shoulders broad,

A formidable figure, never moored.

Long brown robes and spells of mud,

With earth magic scroll, there he stood.

At midday, a threat did come to call,

Riot police and war beast, standing tall.

The villagers trembled, unsure,

But the wizard stepped forward, a reassuring blur.

With boots of mud mastery on his feet,

He stood firm, a sight both strong and sweet.

The police charged, but down they fell,

Their struggles vain, as they sunk and dwelled.

The villagers cheered and hailed his name,

Their protector, forever the same.

With him they knew they'd always be

Safe from harm, eternally.

From that day on, the wizard's fame,

Spread far and wide, a hero without shame.

In the villagers' hearts, he'll always stay,

Their defender, on that fateful day.
Thin brown line.
The Hussites against the Crusaders, battle of Sudomƒõ≈ô 1420
They take on the wrong wizard, beware of powerful mud wizard
Mud Wizards never get any love. Everybody cheers lightning wizards, and witches who can cast love spells, or all the fucking Merlin clones.

I don‚Äôt blame them for just going around fucking up people‚Äôs days with that sticky clingy mud that  is like 10% farm animal droppings.

You go Mud Wizard!

EDIT: I didn‚Äôt realize he was protecting his village. He‚Äôs going easy on those cops. I‚Äôd hit ‚Äòem with a mud slide
Muck the police
Mud wizard. Not the hero Germany wants, but the hero Germany needs.
Amber Heard's lawyer objecting to his own question

At least the guy have learned one thing in law school.. definition of hearsay ü´£
I object your honor, this is devastating to my case!

Any lawyers here who can tell us whether this lawyer is a clown or not?

I'm not looking for off the cuff redditor takes, I'm interested in a professional opinion of this lawyer's constant hearsay objections.

Is this a court case or a television skit?
This lawyer is an idiot.
See Johnny in the corner losing his shit laughing at this idiot...
*But YOU asked the question*

*O... Ok*
Pretty sure this guy only practices bird law or he has really small hands
I love how Johnny immediately cracks up.
I knew Amber could destroy her own acting career but I didn‚Äôt realize she could destroy her lawyers‚Äô legal careers as well. What a talented lady.
Ms Heard will be shitting in her lawyers bed next I reckon.
‚ÄîTo be clear, Hearsay objection is *not* appropriate. The witness was starting to describe something he did not witness himself.‚Äî

Edit: There are much better explanations of what is happening. I was deleting my comment but wasn‚Äôt sure if that would delete all the great clarifications and corrections below. 

The lawyer could request the hearsay evidence be stricken and ask the witness to answer the question asked.
I OBJECT! Why? ‚ÄúBecause the truth is devastating to my case!‚Äù

Your Honor I OBJECT! ‚Ä¶. Because it‚Äôs devastating to my case!
Did this fuckin dude really go "O-oh" like he forgot!? Did Amber disconnect their brain from its stem by throwing another bottle at them too? Holy shit if Depp loses this somehow itll be baffling
You can object to a witness's answer to your question...

This particular one does seem to be poorly handled, but objecting to a witness's answer, whether it's your question or opposing counsel's question is fair game game and common I imagine.
everyones making fun of this guy.  but i mean...how many of y'all would act perfectly knowing that your career is being watched by millions of people and no matter the outcome can affect your career. there is a lot of stress and pressure on this guy.
I‚Äôm dying laughing at this one. It‚Äôs my favorite clip so far from the trial.
Im sure very few of us would want our performance at our jobs to be televised like this....im on Johnny's side but i also feel for the lawyer....he just doing his best....
He's objecting to the answer. Not his own question
"Hearsay?"

#"MY BROTHER IN CHRIST YOU ASKED THE QUESTION"
He's not objecting to his own question. He's objecting to the witness saying that "Doctor Gibson SAID" which is technically hearsay, but since he asked the question, he opened the door for this, which is why the judge calls him our for being a dumbass, presumably because this is not new information for the lawyer himself.
This guy has said that so many times he is now stuck on repeat.
I think he was trying to point out that the dude had no first hand knowledge of how Johnny's finger got cut, but he came off as a dumbass lol. If he held his composure and taken his time, he could have got his point out more coherently
When the police say if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be provided for you, they mean this guy
That's objecting to the answer, not the question. Nothing particularly facepalmy here, though it's difficult to imagine an answer that wouldn't involve some amount of hearsay.
If she can‚Äôt afford good lawyers. How is she going to afford to pay Depp $50M üòÜ
Does nobody here understand that a lawyer can object to the answer to his question if the answer goes against the rules? Hearsay isn't allowed in testimony, wtf is everyone here on!
How dare I say that! Objection!!

Pimp recruiting fails
umm getting hella std‚Äôs for 36k
These dudes that casually suggest women should just sell thier bodies fucking shit themselves when you remind them they have a perfectly fuckable asshole and could easily do the same. They don't like being reminded of that.
That's tax free though!
Better scale that up to 10 a day.
Stay in school kids.
To be fair it's $36,600 in some years......
Bitches with degrees also know getting a shit ton of stds aint worth it
yeah ladies, lets be prostitutes, isn't that a power move?
Just fuck ten guys a day. There problem solved!
Just fuck 10 guys a day for 100 bucks each. Easy money
OP should consider taking it up the ass once a day for $1.99 per day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶big money on a yearly basis. Bitch prolly not getting paid for it now.
A degree, or just passed grade school math
Pimp math
So 10 guys a day 100$ each will get you 365,000
If she fuckin you for $100 she probably not that hot
It's not just his calculus that sucks.  Suggesting that women all become prostitutes‚Äîat any rate‚Äîis sick.
Two things

1) I‚Äôm sure prostitution has a lot of clients but 1 per day is surely a lot more than average, especially for 1 person.

2) ‚ÄúBe your own boss‚Äù? Bruh, you are literally **telling** women to sell their own bodies. What kinda boss listens to random perverted dudes who can‚Äôt do math.
That's $36,500 minus the checkups and treatment for any STDs that might show up.
Still more than what i make
That feeling when the punchline still makes more money than you....
Which is still more than the average teacher.
$100 is crazy cheap though. $1000 is honestly still a bargain. You sell that shit for $1500 a pop, or even $2500 you will have yourself a year. Damn, did I just become a pimp?
Plenty b*tchs with degrees not making $36,500 either
Remember kids, your stupidity will stay on the internet forever. Think before you type.
Still more than a teacher in US
And herpies
Also, taxes?
I mean, that's still 100 bucks for 2 minutes of work
Still though, make it 200 and it's actually a pretty reasonable living. And still a reasonable rate (I assume)
This also belongs in r/iamatotalpieceofshit
Bitches who completed fifth grade can do the math. That is when you learn decimal points. In fact, with a calculator a much younger child could figure it out. A hundred a day is poverty-level income.
Can't spend that 365,000 if you're dead, drug ridden or sick with STDs, hell as soon as you get an STD ain't no one paying you shit for your "work".
Which is still better pay than minimum wage.
Bitches don't even need a degree to figure that out lmao
It might only be $36500 but that's still $10000 more than I get a year and I have a Masters degree...
Wait until she hears about taxes
OK, as a cab driver, I have had a few ladies in my cab who were, as they prefer to call themselves, escorts.  They are, as a rule, nice people, some are, for lack of a better term, "higher class" than others.  One that I gave a ride to on a semi-regular basis, and had no problem talking freely about her business, had a master's degree in journalism, and was considering going back to school for another degree.  But according to her, she made good money, and enjoyed what she did, so was in no hurry to get a "regular" job.

In talking with them, I get the impression that $100 would be on the low end of the scale as far as a "date" with them, and some of them (including the lady with the graduate degree) would not even consider meeting a guy for that amount.

The "higher class" ladies would probably start around $500 for an hour of their time, and go up from there, I know the lady with the graduate degree said she charged $3500 for an overnight stay, with dinner at a nice restaurant, and dancing/movie/show/other activity also paid by the client **required**, not just banging away for the whole night.

I don't know how many people she saw a year, but I suspect certainly less than one per day.

Some of the other ladies, who were not among the "higher class", told me that most of their day was spent texting or talking on the phone to prospective clients, but a couple told me that most of the time, those prospects ended up ghosting them, so a lot of time trying to reel the fish in, but not a lot of success.  Sometimes no success at all.  Plus all the risks that go along with allowing such intimate contact with strangers.

And before anyone asks, no, I don't have phone numbers, nor will I give any clues about who they are, or how to get in touch with them.  I'm not a pimp, and don't want to have any discussions with law enforcement about these ladies.  I don't have a problem with what they do, and I personally believe the laws in the majority of the US regarding sex workers are backward, short-sighted, and stupid.
And 300thousand will go for all the STDs, medications, alcohol and therapy.
Who the fuck wants to work 7 days a week?

I'm gonna need to open a running tab for multiple daily deliveries of pizza, protein shakes, Gatorade, tiger balm...
No, but doing two guys a day for 200 each and paying half in expenses/taxes amounts to a respectable 73k a year.
Still making more than alot of people with degrees then.
Still not bad for 5 mins work a day.
I mean instead of 8 hour work weeks you have to work maybe 15 to 30 mins a day XD not bad trade. and if you need more money you go into over time XD

I've seen this tweet posted so many times. I wonder if the original person was just being funny and knew full well that the math was wrong. But since this was screenshotted and shared so many times, everyone just assumes now that they're dumb
That's like 30 miles of dick a year.
But if you‚Äôre really good at fucking you can charge $500 and that‚Äôs not a bad living.
Dumb broke ho trap to turn them into prostitutes
Dude just invented prostitution
At this point it's fiscally irresponsible to not be in sex work. Pretty sure prostitutes go for way more than 100 and it seems like easy enough work. Not to mention all the money you see strippers and pornstars making on the internet.
A minor quibble.  This could be easily resolved by charging $1000, or fucking 10 guys a day, or somewhere in between.  4 guys for $250 seems like your best bet
$36,500 is still crazy though, right? For like ten minutes out of your day. There‚Äôs a big social stigma against sex workers, but I really don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs any different from people serving alcohol or food‚Äîexcept it pays a lot better! People should be free to do whatever they want with their body
Damn 1 guy a day?? Those are rookie numbers! You got to pump those numbers up!!!
I‚Äôd fuck one guy a day for $100. Straight male here willing to take it for the team.
It‚Äôs obviously a 10 year plan ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Don't forget the 2 cents (there are 365.2 days in a year, the .2 representing leap years)

Weirdly enough there are fat blue haired ‚Äúlesbians‚Äù with gender studies degrees out there making six figures as ‚ÄúVP of Diversity and Inclusion‚Äù or some BS like that

My grandma is paying $100 a month for 300g of whey protein isolate because it "helps prevent cancer". I told her she could pay $25 for 800g of the same thing on amazon, but she doesn't believe me when i tell her its the same thing and would rather believe the person that is trying to sell her the product. I gave up. I hate how easily people can be influenced.
A friends elderly mom is refusing because she heard it causes infertility.  Regardless of if it does, she is post menopausal.
I worked in water quality for a large US metro-area. I was responsible for monitoring the water quality of over 2 million people (not me alone, but I was part of the department). My father in law told me that by drinking city water I was endangering his daughters health due to the chlorine. I attempted to explain to him how the dose-response relationship works and how we constantly measure chlorine and chlorine byproduct residuals to ensure they stay below a level that would adversely impact the health of people. He went on to explain to me that ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs present and you‚Äôre measuring for it, surely it‚Äôs a concern. If it‚Äôs a concern it‚Äôs bad for you‚Äù. It was at that point I had to walk away, knowing I wasn‚Äôt doing any good by continuing the discussion.

Edit: I no longer work for the same utility and actually run my own consulting business now, but I did at the time of the discussion.
My father in-law announced he's leaving his wife of 40 years to move to Indonesia because Trump lost the election (we are Canadian btw üòê). So yeah, I'm right there with you.
One hopes that those "doctors" can be identified and reported to their medical associations.
My aunt genuinely believes the Pfizer vaccine is actually an attempt by Bill Gates to implant trackable microchips in people.


She's not allowed to watch our kids anymore.
The Dunning-Kruger is strong with this one.
My mother told me that Steve Jobs was actually murdered by the government because "rich people don't get cancer."

I explained that the most basic mechanism from which cancer arises  is normal to all cells and is impossible to stop without killing the host. She refused to believe me.

I'm a cancer biologist.
You have to understand that you and the other thousands of researchers are part of the establishment which is controled by reptiloids. /s
My mom, a nurse of 20+ years is now touting anti-vaxx conspiracy theories all over Facebook and to all her friends/fam. RIP.
"Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein‚Äîor even just a piece of a protein‚Äîthat triggers an immune response inside our bodies." - cdc.gov

I see why they think that. It sounds like that. But just a little bit further down the page it says "The mRNA never enters the nucleus where DNA is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions."
Genuine question. Can someone eli5 why is this happening? Why do people believe random stuff from the internet over a relative? I know about the dunning-kruger effect, but it doesn't seem to apply here
Do parents just never trust their kids professional judgement?

Mine don‚Äôt hesitate to correct my legal input with something they remember from law and order or a church friend.
My father in law is convinced that quarantines and PPE do not effect the chances of a disease spreading. He is literally married to a epidemiologist.
I‚Äôm an ICU nurse who takes care of covid patients. My older sister is also a nurse. Our father has multiple graduate degrees, so by no means uneducated. But my father still is adamant that covid is a hoax, and at the least just another flu that the government is blowing out of proportion to make money. I‚Äôve given up providing him with actual evidence that his conspiracies are unfounded, let alone personal experience that covid is brutally killing people in the worst way to die, because he just ignores it in favor of unsubstantiated online articles by ‚Äúholistic medicine‚Äù and anti-vax egg heads.
He saw it on the internet. Therefore it must be true.
I feel for these people. I work in financial advice, creating the rules that 300 financial advisers follow and my parents still think they know better
It's true, the covid-19 vaccine will alter my DNA and it will be the same as HULK or maybe Magneto
Perhaps the most upsetting part of this year has been learning how many of my friends and family are total, complete, morons.
I can absolutely sympathise. I've heard my wife arguing with her parents over Skype when they tell her she should be taking all sorts of "complementary medicine" to prevent COVID, and how the vaccines are all a scam by Bill Gates and "Big Pharma" which is why they won't be having it.

She spent 10 years as a post-doc vaccine researcher (albeit a vaccine against a bacterial illness) - so obviously has no understanding of the situation.
Wait!...So you are saying the vaccine changes your DNA?  Sweet!, can I choose?  I see this as a tool for the future.
My father has a PhD in electrical engineering and I have always appreciated his rational thinking and empirical way of knowing... then trump came along and he has lost his grip on reality and fact and bases his decisions on feelings and faith.  I feel your pain. It‚Äôs like voluntary Alzheimer‚Äôs
But you see, Ed, for him you will always be the reason their daughter became such a disappointment
My fellas folks believe the G in 5G stands for gigahertz & my bloke is a telecoms engineer with a degree and no matter how often he tells them it stands for generation, they keep saying about all the bad energy the 5 gigas are giving off. Sigh.
Sometimes I am hopeful when I realize that stupid people can have smart children.
Reminds me of my work (giving legal advice to companies on Customs matters in the USA).  

Importer wants to import a bunch of stuff from China. I tell them to not forget about the massive tariffs that Trump put into place on most stuff from China (which Biden is keeping for now0.  They tell me "nah, China is paying those, that's what Trump said".  I tell them that's false.  

Fast forward a few months later, and they get massive bills from Customs for said tariffs. They come to my office, exacerbated, asking if the bill is real and if they have to pay and why they should have to pay since China is paying the tariffs.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
They don't want the truth they want the story that back up the 'truth' they want.
Oh, yeah, the old YouTube research thing. Can't believe people take it at face value, but then, we have an astonishing number of evidence.
I‚Äôve had people in my family tell me that they won‚Äôt get the vaccine. They believe the vaccine has tissue from aborted fetuses. Not making this up. I‚Äôm dead serious. And they completely 100% believe this shit. See what religion and spending 20 years of listening too bs news will do to you boys and girls. Stay away from it.
‚ÄúBut I saw someone on a screen say it!‚Äù
You can‚Äôt reason someone out of a position they didn‚Äôt reason themselves into.
My husband literally studies epidemiology yet somehow he‚Äôs the one getting lectured by his parents, my parents, and even my boss about the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that mask mandates were just about controlling the population. Those 5 people have a combined total of 3 high school diplomas and 0 college degrees. My husband and I both have master‚Äôs degrees and he‚Äôs currently pursuing a PhD. It‚Äôs so disheartening how they‚Äôve become programmed to distrust any and all experts and science unless it already agrees with them and their simplistic view of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚Äúpatriotism.‚Äù
With ‚Äòtwo doctors‚Äô. Not two doctors.
I was an Air Traffic Controller. If anyone else is old enough to remember Y2K? I had a friend who was CONVINCED that all the airplanes were going to fall out of the sky at midnight on Dec 31 because of Y2K. Ummm, NO! That is not how planes fly and even if every single computer system on the aircraft failed? They would still fly. The pilots would not be happy and would be looking for the nearest airport to set down but they would not immediately crash. But WTF did I know?
Same generation who were so easily convinced that Sadam had weapons of mass destruction, and that marjuana users should be put in prison.
My ex‚Äôs mother thought covid19 was made in a lab. My ex cited me telling her off when we broke up. 

Honestly it might be for the best...

Edit: she wasn't saying it was some accidental release from a lab, she was saying it was a biological weapon...
I feel like it is an obligation for parents to believe that their children's degrees are worthless.
When I was I kid my parents told me that "people on the TV can fly" to teach me that not everything I learn on TV is real.

These days I use "people on YouTube can fly" to do the same to people around me... including my parents.
lemme guess its two dudes in white coats wearing stethoscopes with a big shelf of important looking books behind them?
[deleted]
My family believes Covid-19 is real, but it's a secret bioweapon made by China to assassinate world leaders and hence, they are attending a family-wedding in defiance of China.

I'm not sure how the logic adds up if you believe the disease is real. But at least they said they will wear masks.
I keep arguing with antivax folks and they keep pointing out this ‚Äúone doctor in Germany‚Äù or some nebulous ‚Äúalliance of doctors for truth‚Äù or some other such bullshit and when you question why the would choose some doc in Germany as their reliable source of truth over the scientific consensus of thousands or qualified people, they just say ‚ÄúEveryone else is funded by Big Pharma‚Äù and end the conversation.  It is fucking infuriating having to deal with stupid people.
Confirmation bias is one hell of a drug for the uninformed.
I'm sorry you dad is an uninformed person  maybe you should make a youtube video and show him.
Hopefully you ended the conversation with "well if you'll excuse me, I gotta go alter your daughter's DNA, if you know what I mean *wink*‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not surprised. I work with nurses that don‚Äôt believe in the vaccines or even believe in covid. It‚Äôs amazing how truly stupid people can be.
There will always be stupid people
I feel this in my RNA.
‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù almost always means chiropractor for these kinds of ‚Äúdocumentaries‚Äù.
Not a Dr, but I play one with my kids sometimes. Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to talk to your father in law.
My Dad looked at me like I was a complete idiot because I tried to explain to him that Dr. Frankenstein and his monster wasn't real. When he was in the Air Force he and some of his buddies went to Frankenstein's castle in the early 60's and the people their told him all about the weird experiments they witnessed. I'm the moron.
My dad thinks Biden let China into Texas power grid  so they could take it down so he could look like a hero. ü§°
That might be like saying clipping your toenails changes the size of your feet
*Two people acting as doctors.
Cool, so if I commit crimes then get the vaccination, I'll never be caught?
Has OP tried putting a video on Youtube? Because that's what these people really trust.
"Doctors". Anyone can say they're a doctor on YouTube.
lol. Does he worry when he eats a lettuce leaf about the trillions of lettuce DNA and RNA molecules he‚Äôs putting inside his body?  Is he concerned he will become green & leafy?
Facebook is bad, but Youtube is where the real indoctrination happens.  Humans are much more likely to believe something they see than something they read.  I call them Misinfomercials.
I suggest you smuggle a top secret pill out of your lab that protects those in the "inner circle" from the chromosomal effects to your loved one.  The fact that it resembles a Tictac and leaves their breath minty fresh is just a happy coincidence.
[deleted]
I don't know. I got vaccinated and I keep hearing these voice. It is saying resistance is futile. I feel the need to be around other vaccinated people. Maybe live in a commune
My mom routinely tells me her Google search is as good as my research. 

I have grad degrees in information science and research degrees on how people search for information. Plus over a decade in the field. 

But no. You‚Äôre right, our searches are equal.
Father in law clearly hates you and doesn't believe a word you say
Sounds like my dad telling my husband (who is a doctor, works with Covid patients) that it is a ‚Äúscam-demic‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt exist
No joke for a minute: That's expected from older people. Y'all seem to forget that their generation grew up learning that the TV/Radio will bring the real news out, they believe that whatever comes from the tv or radio must be true, and they port that feeling to the internet.  

They dont realize the internet is not moderated, not controlled, and that literally anyone can say whatver crazy shit they want to say and theres nothign to control that. They don't understand that most of what's in the internet are jokes and lies, they take it all as truth.

This, paired with the social bubbles social media creates, turns into all this... shit
"I don't need a microchip to track me everywhere I go and listen in to what I say and be controlled by Bill Gates."


Listen dude, you haven't noticed it yet but you carry a pocket computer with a unique identifier and a microphone while using apps and websites with targeted advertisements and curated content. They don't need to inject you with a mandatory tiny microchip to track you and sway public opinion, you and your friends and family did it to yourself.
Wait til he hears the earth is round and goes around the sun
Cute. Since RNA leaves the double-membrane nuclear envelope instead of entering it. 

Maybe he‚Äôs a special human with reverse transcriptase? I‚Äôm sure Dr YouTube and Nurse Facebook can easily verify this.....

My blood boils at such ignorance. 

Better an in-law than your spouse though.
I have big balls, people told me getting the vaccine would shrink my big balls but I went and got the vaccine injected straight into my big balls which proved to them I still have big balls.
Ok but do you have a YouTube channel??? Exactly.
2 out of 3 doctors agree, getting sick and dying to own the libs is a great way to go.
The funny thing is about some of these conspiracies is that the end goal is never really thought about. To whose benefit would it be to change our DNA and how? To make everyone obedient mindless slaves? Who wants to rule a world full of mindless slaves?
‚ÄúNever argue with a stupid person. They will bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience.‚Äù
A patient of mine today said she was allergic to the COVID vaccine. I asked her if she'd had the first one yet. You can guess her answer.
My grandma refuses because she saw some shit on fb saying they put "chips" in them... she doesnt even know what a chip is or how computers work, cant figure out her own phone... says "its in the bible, a revelation"... wtf actually.
society.
Sucks, I‚Äôm in a lockdown because of people like your father.
Scientific name = poison

To be fair, apple is scary enough to keep the doctors away.
I buy the n-Pentanol free apples. Namaste
Wait, apples have alcohol?




Edit: lots of people saying 'don't you know about cider?'. The level of alcohol in cider is not present in an apple when freshly picked. You have to ferment the sugar in apples for that. What was interesting that, even before you ferment apples for cider, there was a trace amount of alcohol in the fruit.
It's like how you can cause panic by saying there's "dihydrogen monoxide" in the water
All these Chemicals in apples? I bet it's a GMO apple. This is why I buy only gluten free apples and wash them in essential oils before eating them - Karen
Science is the devil!
wait till the anti-vaxx folks find out water is a  single molecule from explosive hydrogen gas
These are also the same people who will buy rocks from Gwyneth Paltrow to stick up their yahoos. 

Having a chemical name doesn‚Äôt mean something is bad for you. Having a ‚Äònatural‚Äô name doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good.

Snake venom is all-natural, organic, pasture raised and you don‚Äôt want it anywhere near you.
I‚Äôm scared of what I don‚Äôt understand
I hate the new buzzword "chemicals" as if it's a bad thing. I think when a lot of people think of the word chemicals they think of bleach, ammonia, and lye and think "I DON'T WANT THAT IN MY BODY."
What's the difference between poison and medicine?


>!quantity!<
I avoid all molecules.  My diet is elementary
Anti-vaxxer jokes are just like kids of anti-vaxxers.

They never get old.
I remember when there was that lawsuit brought up against LaCroix for their flavoring ingredients not being natural. It turned out they just used the scientific names of essential flavoring oils.
So apples don't contain water or any salt?
People often forget that literally everything is made of chemicals, in one form or another. Just because something is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for you, and if it‚Äôs synthetic, it‚Äôs bad for you. Cyanide can be found in lots of plants, including apple seeds.
I‚Äôm not sure I would like to be injected with an apple...
Wait til they find out about dihydrogen monoxide!
Chemistry scares the hell out of some people, but it's pretty useful if you want anything to *matter*.
Remember when we had a shot time where we like science and scientists. Let's bring back those days.
Why did you blur Luke's picture in the second screenshot but not in the first? It's mildy anoying, but then again im just too picky.
Knowing the chemical composition isn't even a factor for determinating whether something is safe to ingest.

For apples, we don't consider chemical composition or the parts the sum to the whole - we just consider the whole. For vaccines, we consider animal and then human trials for **both** efficacy and safety.

The "here's a list of chemicals, therefore you know it is/isn't safe" is simply fallacious reasoning. And it's a fallacy started by anti vaxxers. Don't feed into it. 

Tl;Dr: The **science** is based on human trials: we gather statistics on efficacy, mortality rates, side-effects, etc. Knowing the chemicals within a compound is useless information in effort to determine whether it's safe OR effective to eat.
You only find scientific names of chemicals in two places: Laboratories and the ingredients section on food packaging.

Also, anything can sound poisonous if converted to scientific names.

What if I told you that every pastry had (2R,3S,4S,5R,6R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-\[(2R,3S,4R,5R,6S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl\]oxy-oxane-3,4,5-triol in it? You would probably freak out. This chemical is just flour.
To be fair, apples are what got us kicked out of the garden of eden so don‚Äôt be so quick to judge.
This reminds me of a random 60 Minutes piece I saw when I was like 9.

It was about Girl Scout cookies, and the guy read the ingredients. "Flour, sugar, water, RIBOFLAVIN?! I dont know what that is, but riboflavin? I dont want some artificial chemical, who knows what it could be."

Its vitamin b. Girl scout cookies are fortified to make them healthier.
The skin of those things is riddled with toxins.
"I only accept natural ingredidents, like water"

"What about dihydrogen monoxide?"

"Eww no"
to be fair (I fully support vaccines btw) an apple is safe to eat, not necessarily to inject
I'm a chemist. Most of these listed chemicals aren't safe to inject. The people in this thread bashing those who are 'afraid of science' are just as dumb. If I saw this post, I would be concerned because either 1. my prior understanding of the safety of vaccines was called into question or 2. the person sharing was sharing misinformation. If I was suspicious of the first I would have done a search to find credible scientific sources to see if that that was true.

It's a little fucked that this guy shared misinformation in his original post (claiming it was the composition of a vaccine) just to make a point.
My favorite is monosodium glutamate. Some people read the name and think it's literally satan, but if you look at the molecule, it's a glutamic acid (an aminoacid) that lost a hydrogen ion that was replaced by sodium. Of course you shouldn't be eating much of it because it has sodium, but it's perfectly safe as a condiment.
I would be like "I don't know, how much are you using of all of these?"
"Dihydrogen monoxide."

"Eww, that sounds chemical, get that shit away from me."

"Crack."

"Hmm that sounds like a nice non-chemical name, let me inject that."
I wouldnt want an apple injected into me
Apples are dangerous: they turned newton into a lizard man! Then he invented gravity so he could indoctrinate everyone with his globe earth model!
To be fair, I wouldn‚Äôt want an Apple injected into my body either.
Everything is chemicals. Anything is poison in the right amount.

ETA: TBF I wouldn‚Äôt inject apple juice into my body.
Source that it is a chemical composition of an apple?
My best friend gets terrible IBS from eating apples. His body does the objecting for him.
It's crazy to think,

- chemist named these biochemical compounds

- anti-vax people look at these names and view them as "scary"

- but they dont believe the biochemical people when they say it's safe. 

It's like if they if they named it something cute would it help? You go along with their naming but not their science behind it?
"No NO that's WRONG. Apples are natural. God wouldnt put man made chemicals into them. See? This is what I've been talking about. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!"


^^^^^^^dont ^^^^^^^make ^^^^^^^me ^^^^^^^regret ^^^^^^^not ^^^^^^^putting ^^^^^^^a ^^^^^^^/s
I really hate companies that advertise on the premise of "CHEMICALS YOU CAN PRONOUNCE!" It really feeds into this type of bs thinking from science deniers. Just because you can't pronounce it doesn't mean it's harmful or even artificial.
That's why the scientific name for snakes is noodleous dangeri
I am certainly not opposed to the presence of ethanol in my blood.
My favorite are videos of people boiling soda and the sugars caramelize and burn when the water evaporates and they're like "THIS IS IN SODA"
Sounds like a lot of people never paid attention in chemistry.  Do you know what these "chemicals" are?  Be careful of all of those "chemicals" with names that you don't understand; fun fact, pure water is also a chemical compound.  So just because something is a chemical, does NOT inherently mean it is bad.  Maybe read up on them and find thier more common names, if they have them, or just better understand chemistry and biology.  Don't let ignorance steer us in the wrong direction, make sure it is at least an informed bad decision.
He forget cyanide. üòÖüòÖ
Just passed o chem, this shot terrifies me.
To be fair, I wouldn't let you inject me with an apple.
1-Hexanol is also one of the chemicals that generates the smell of freshly mowed grass.
Camphor is in practically every topical pain relief product from Tiger Balm to VapoRub to BenGay
That's why the scientific name for snakes is noodleous dangeri
I injected an apple into my deltoid muscle and I'm fine
can't believe how many are arguing that you shouldn't inject an apple in your blood stream ... the question was "have in your body" for christ' sake ...
Bahahaha haha.  That‚Äôs how you apply logic to these morons. Unfortunately they are ignorant enough to come up with something to explain anything away. With or without facts.
r/murderedbywords
100% of people exposed to dihydrogen monoxide will die.

It is a chemical so corrosive that is is known to scientists as "the universal solvent".
Ethanol?
Vaccines should be forcibly mandated to everyone!!!
[deleted]
Guys dont drink H¬≤O it's poisonous
[deleted]
but what stuff is normally, if that is something. in a vaccine?
fuck that 

apple ingredient list doesn‚Äôt even say electrolytes
[deleted]
None, because they protect me from diseases.
That was so well planned out
Did he just break down an apple to a molecular level? Shiiiit....
There's this dumb anti-vax mom that I have added on Facebook who constantly posts anti-vax shit and Corona virus conspiracy garbage. And recently apparently her loser baby daddy shot a Chihuahua that went into their front yard because they felt threatened. I see them as everything that is wrong with the US as far as citizens go
That's why I hate all these food companies trying to use the line "made with ingredients you can pronounce"

Like, wow. I'm supposed to limit what I eat based on what idiots are too dumb to say?
Explains why we‚Äôll over half the chemicals are flavonoids
To be fair I wouldn‚Äôt inject an apple
Reminds me of the time that American said that she wasn't sad about "homo sapiens going extinct"
Apples have ethanol? Damn no wonder I like them
Forgot [dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody)
I‚Äôm sensitive to apples. Make me want to vomit and diarrhea. So, basically, yes.
Get fucked haha
Have you seen snow white? That shit is poisonous.
To be fair, I wouldn't want anyone to inject apple juice into my veins either...
Ignorance + stupidity
I love this.
But if ‚Äòan apple a day keeps the doctor away‚Äô, an apple is a vaccine.  Checkmate atheists
Luke is fucking savage. I like Luke.
Doubt. Apples consist of mostly dihydrogenmonoxide
That list is just a bunch of carbohydrates. I guess high school chemistry wasn't her strongest subject.
 Netflix  has a special on anti vaxxers and I don‚Äôt get why. Their beliefs are dangerous and doctors vehemently oppose their mentalities as it pertains to vaccinations.
To be fair if an antivaxer asked you to inject apple juice into your veins would you?
Wait so vaccines are made of apples?!
I once asked my mom what she thinks of "Sodium-Chloride" - she answered with disgust "chemical bullshit. I don't want to deal with artificial poison"
She didn't know what to say when I told her it's regular old salt. Same thing when I told her to hand me over some dihydrogen monoxide
the USPS is not a business

The USPS would make money if congress would let it.
I get so sick of people putting down the post office. It‚Äôs an honorable way to earn a living and they provides necessary service. Some rich fucks just want to abscond with all their equipment and either sell it off or take it over.
> No one says the military loses $750b a year

I say that.
Apparently a lot of people are unaware of the financial burden put on the post office so that it fails on purpose. Such as having to [pre fund retirement ](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2019/congress-is-sabotaging-your-post-office/) pension by 75 years, and treating it like a piggy bank.
Why wouldn't it be viewed favorably? I get my mail. I can track any packages I'm expecting online. I'm pretty satisfied with the service the USPS provides.
Another example of a service that, if it didn't already exist, conservatives would think was the most extremist socialist bullshit they'd ever heard. "You want the *government* to subsidize billions of packages and letters a year rather than leaving it to lucrative private companies like FedEx? How are we ever going to pay for that?"
~~I believe it's technically a government owned and run business,~~ but that should not be a reason to get rid of it. If we can throw billions of dollars at defense every year we can afford USPS, and that's from a veteran. If you could see the nonsense the military wastes their money on for military non-combat related things.

Edit: Can't get a good source for the first line to prove/disprove.
It wouldn't even "lose" money if it didn't have pension savings requirements several orders of magnitude more severe than any other business or government agency, designed specifically to hamper their performance.
Crazy how we spend a shit ton on the military and the troops still get the most cheap things possible
I've always marveled at the fact that you could mail a letter for the cost of a stamp either across town or to northern Alaska. I understood, even as a child, the wisdom in this. 

If private groups take over this will change. All the well-connected corporations will want the money-making urban areas and will shun the rural areas. Strange that Trump supporters in rural areas don't realize this.
To be fair, USPS was completely self sufficient before the US government actively started sabotaging it.
Excuse me, 720b on military?!?!, how much money do you guys have to blow?
As a European, I'm surprised more people in America are in favor of paying tax for a postal service than a decent healthcare system.

EDIT: apparently the usps is not funded by tax, but I still find it strange how more people are in favour of a government-owned postal service than a good healthcare system.
Economy isn't The Economist's strong suit.
Do people not get that they pay for postage?
>No one says the military loses $750b a year.

Maybe people should start saying that.
maybe we should talk about the military like that...
Well the postal service actually accomplishes something on a daily basis. Most of the military just prance around acting tough.
When you control the mail, you control information
Which is why the UK government sold theirs off & they're doing the same with our health service. Never underestimate a money grabbing wanker. They will get rid if they think they can make some lovely share money.
To me, if nothing else, the USPS is an insurance policy.  Having a logistics system that has the capacity to reach literally every single building in the United States of America every single day is valuable.  When Trump was on his kick about organizing the military for the purpose of vaccine distribution I just thought to myself...why? We have an in place logistics system that is super fucking efficient, and touches everyone.  Once the government has the vaccines, they could have it in the hands of the entire nation in literally a day or two.  Or imagine there was a need to distribute arms in the event of some sort of invasion.
Most Americans can afford and many already have their own guns so we should stop funding the socialized military.
What happens to the billions in pension and health money if GOP gets their wish and post office gets privatized.?
This isn‚Äôt true. The United States post office is supposed to be self-sustaining. They are supposed to pay for itself through stamps and other delivery costs.
Except the military actually loses money, like literally. The Pentagon doesnt "know" where 22 trillion of it went over the last few decades..
The military loses $750 billion a year.
It wasn‚Äôt losing money until Bush made it lose money on purpose by forcing prepaying benefits for 75 years lol wat
The military loses HOW MUCH a year?!
The USPS only loses money because the government has been intentionally crippling it for years

If the government allowed it, the USPS could be making a profit by the end of the month. It would literally be that easy
I‚Äôm willing to bet money that if you calculate the economic benefit of USPS, then estimate the tax revenue from that economic benefit, it would more than cover the amount of public funding USPS gets.
It‚Äôd be like saying light houses lose money annually. They‚Äôre certainly helpful (I‚Äôm not sure how helpful in this day & age of electronics, but apparently they‚Äôre still in use), but just because they cost money to maintain doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre a failing service. Also, Aug 7 was National Lighthouse Day!

The US Postal Service has some apparently ridiculous funding requirements for their retirements and is tasked with serving low-population areas, so they shouldn‚Äôt be expected to be cash cows. Government isn‚Äôt a business.
God damn libraries are money pits too
Exactly this... people who think the USPS should be run like a company are completely out-of-touch with why it exists in the first place.
You dumbfuck, You do realize USPS would turn a huge profit for the GOV if there wasn't a mandate from Congress for USPS to pre-fund future retirements for 75 years in the future?
Apparently people don't understand how stamps work. 

I know this is gonna be downvoted like crazy but the United States Postal Service actually "receives¬†NO tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations."

This is partly why FedEx, UPS, and Amazon use the USPS to deliver local parcels, despite having the resources to deliver it themselves. 

The USPS is dying. They are severely underfunded, understaffed, and receive no government assistance to continue operating. Sure they have an annual revenue of 70 billion dollars, but their annual expenses exceed their revenue by nearly 4 billion dollars annually. This is why you receive so many junk ads in your mailbox, is bc that postage keeps the mail carrier service barely treading water. People sending flat mail such as letters has dropped by 31% in the last decade, which is a massive revenue loss. And due to lack of funding they've even closed 4% (1,300+) post offices and have had to let go of 11% of their total workforce (~80,000 employees) while trying to expand more delivery points, which shot up by over 8 million locations.

The USPS had requested a relief bailout (like many other dying capitalistic businesses) and was frankly told "No." They were told they "could open a loan or have nothing at all", and Trump said he would veto any relief effort to bailout the postal service. We as a nation could easily save the USPS (if it's not too late) by privatizing the USPS and opening them up to international markets and make the playing field level and equal with UPS and FedEx.

Exactly! I had a discussion with someone who thinks public transit should be eliminated by saying the city should subsidize car purchases. Well, it's NOT for-profit It's a service to thousands of people who take the bus. It's a lifeline for disabled people, immigrants, people who don't drive, women, poor people, etc. Also, by taking the bus, you're helping the environment by having one less car on the road!
It operates as a business to self-fund, however Republicans sabotaged that structure years ago by requiring fully funded pensions including for new hires.  Now they‚Äôre gutting it completely.
Stop fucking phrasing it the wrong way. Frame it properly: 'The post office was vastly successful financially, until Republicans stepped in to make them pay out 75 years worth of future benefits, or a few billion dollars. At once.'
Now what if we give USPS guns too?
i do. the american military budget is farcical. we could solve every problem on earth, AND expand into space, with what is being *wasted* on the military.
With their increase in shipping prices it feels a little bit like a business.
the US makes a ton of money from the military through a process known as imperialism. ive got some literature to read if youd like to learn more
The USPS loses money because of a bill introduced by Republicans many years ago, that requires the USPS to pre-pay the pension of any employees, and it's the only government entity that has to do this.  If it wasn't required, they'd actually turn a healthy profit every year.
I do. The military loses $750 billion a year.
The military's loss of $750b per year is weapons manufacturers' gain.
but that's money that could go towards more corporate bailouts!! think of the yachts 400 people can only have 7 of...
I do think USPS needs a refresh. No reason for six day delivery. Maybe transition to cluster boxes as much as possible, instead of door to door delivery. Having someone ‚Äòwalk‚Äô a postal route, six days a week,  is fucking ridiculous. Especially considering that 90% of mail is bulk rate garbage. Really, it‚Äôs more like 98% for me.
Where does the military lose it though?

Asking for a friend.
I‚Äôve been disappointed with The Economist lately. I‚Äôm starting to see their bias a lot more now.

For example, they had an article come out about how kids need to physically go back to school, even though it‚Äôs not safe. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve never taken an online class before. I‚Äôve been taking online classes for years and with today‚Äôs technology it‚Äôs not a big deal at all.
Why do people constantly talk about the government like it is a business? A business and a government have completely different purposes
Seems like every news outlet is trying to justify tearing apart the USPS. Rip America. Sorry we let a bunch of pieces of shit tear you to shreds.
I don‚Äôt really like the usps but they‚Äôre fine I guess
I do
And that‚Äôs the freaking Economist
[removed]
I thought he said ups not usps for a moment
No one says it, but they really fucking should.
You guys are getting fucked both ways, then they ask you to pay for it.
Of course, as a service it was making money until the Republican controlled congress under Dubya hamstrung it in 2006.
I mean, the DoD loses soldiers, ships, planes, missiles, nukes (17 actually, *not cool at all*),...

But it is all spending, no losses.
The military is a loss, though
Also we at least get some benefit from the post office. Bombing brown people hasn't ever benefited anyone except the people who sell bombs.
People should say the military loses $750b a year.
Hear hear
Maybe we should start saying the military loses 750 billion per year
So how about, you know, reeling in on some of that military expenditure?
Is there waste in the system? Absolutely. Tons of it. But I'm really glad the service exists. Instead of ripping it apart, we need to call up the legion of Industrial Engineers to clean it up.
I always see these polls like ‚Äú43% of Americans don‚Äôt support mail in voting‚Äù or ‚Äú51% of Americans don‚Äôt support travel bans‚Äù but my question is, where TF are these polls being taken? Because I‚Äôve never taken one in my life
Just like healthcare
What a great response!  Thank you
And it costs that much because it's required by congress to pay pensions out 75 years in advance for all employees.
But seriously the military does lose billions every year.
Maybe progressives should reframe the narrative and start talking about the military in terms of annual losses.
Maybe we should start saying the military looses billions of dollars every year.
yall should be saying something about the military
It's a facepalm about the state of affairs
If they want to stop the postal service, let's trade off Admendment 2 against Article I, Section 8, Clause 7¬†of the Constitution.
The argument shouldn‚Äôt be if it‚Äôs profitable or if it‚Äôs a valuable service but whether it should be a privatized or subsidized? I think there are valid arguments on both sides. This requires much deeper discussion since it‚Äôs not as simple as USPS is good or bad. 

For example, if it were privatized then it would be much more efficient however the rural areas may see increases in costs. 

I think a national security argument could be made in favor of the USPS to some degree. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for businesses to have to compete with a subsidized service, especially in urban areas where Amazon, FedEx, UPS, and others would be able to provide better service while also making a profit. 

Edit: Not to mention that anything subsidized is then exposed to political influence and manipulation as we see today. My stance would be to dissolve the USPS to let free markets work while regulating the market as needed for oversight.
Was The Economist always fishwrap?
r/murderedbywords
Yeah, but bombs and terrorists and stuff.
Okay but the military doesn‚Äôt charge for their service.  

But if they would like to cut costs and increase revenue charge regular rates for junk mail advertising.  If that drops service from 6 days to 4 then so be it as no one wants that shit anyway.

Hmm. A lot of downvotes but not one counterfact.  What are you perceiving?  The USPS can be revenue neutral, as intended, by doing something so simple.
The service hasn‚Äôt kept pace with the times.  Daily mail delivery is crazy for most people. It‚Äôs mostly stuff that goes right into recycle.  If someone wants daily let them pay for it.  Only the government would lose money at a service that brings people mostly things they don‚Äôt want at a too frequent interval.
I hate reddit oh my god bro
And honestly it's not even a particularly good service sometimes. There are constant fuckups.
The phrasing med me to think that the article was referring to money lost in the sense that they lose a lot of mail
The article is [here](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/08/08/the-postal-service-has-become-vital-to-americas-elections). Unsurprisingly it's not as "hurhur it's a service dumdum" as many people here are making out.
[removed]
Why are we charged to ship packages and have to buy stamps should be free then right?
Billions in losses, o no.
The military is the only thing enabling our current economy. So you could say the military generates a multi-trillion dollar profit every year.

You're admitting that government programs can be totally mismanaged and wasteful. FedEx can make billions in profit, but god forbid the USPS breaks even..?

this is funny cause usps is pretty much a privatized service that literally borrows tax payers money to make billions.
*The U.S. Postal Service lost $8.8 billion in fiscal 2019, more than doubling its losses from the previous year.*

At this point the USPS is just mailing it in.
We should say that! If we didn‚Äôt pay for food and water, the military would be force to loot and raid Canadian and Mexican cities, expanding the influence of America, saving a bunch of money, and making us way cooler.
Yay üôå lets go in debt for no reason, because "it's a service"
‚ÄúIf masks were necessary we would have evolved one by now‚Äù lmao

Or glasses, or have ever gotten medical care.

Shaun knocking them out with 5 words
Clothes, cars, SMARTPHONES...

All essentials to evolution
isn't technology like masks really just human made things to accomplish the same thing as evolution: help us survive
Someone should tell whales and dolphins to evolve some gills already.
This is the modern day equivalent of "If man was meant to fly, God would have given us wings."
If clothes were necessary we would have evolved some covering over our skin but what do I know lol
you dont need to censor Shaun's twitter handle we all know who he is lol
The skeleton has a YouTube-channel. Pretty chill dude.
Man for some reason my brain was thinking ‚ÄúNeil deGrasse Tyson‚Äù and my dumbass called myself a dumbass for such a thought.
I guess his brain didn't evolved. Sadly we protect stupid people. By now they would have died out.
why are you censoring a verified name?
Shaun!
Well I just flew in and boy are my arms tired. . .

You know, from the wings I evolved.
Every species eventually goes extinct though, we have the intelligence to design things to try to prevent this as evolution might be too slow. I guess some people would rather just die.
This is the same reason why I refuse to wear an oxygen tank when scuba diving.            /s
I'm astonished someone this stupid believes in evolution, tbh.
If oxygen were necessary, we would've had our own oxygen generator inside of our bodies by now. #letthatsinkin #dmnimmigrantstaeknawajaebs #owningthelibs #[rickroll](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
By this logic we‚Äôd all have toilets attached to our asses
Shaun, legendary as always
But Neil, our airways have built in masks. The slime protects against bacteria, and a mask for your face is just an "upgrade" to your natural defences. Wear a mask, dammit!
What a long winded way to say "I don't understand evolution".
Neil is not the smartest toe in the shoe, is he?
Why wear a jacket when it gets cold? Surely our bodies will have evolved to protect us and keep us warm when it's -20C?
Is that Shaun? Why did you black his name out? He needs more attention
I'll live 3 miles from the nearest school so my kid will evolve to a car
But barefoot is better... 

Stronger ligaments and bones and joints is always better and it prob prevent lots of foot disease, plus if you run you don't touch the ground with the back of your feet reducing impact on your knees but forced to do so with most shoes.
Half of the world didn‚Äôt wear masks during the bubonic(black) plague...Yes I agree the masks are annoying but if you don‚Äôt believe in them at least have the decency(if there is any left in the world) to wear one for those who do worry about it.
people can't be this stupid they just can't
The stupidity of that statement is mind boggling.
Alright Neil, take off your pants then.
We evolved a mask for pandemics: it‚Äôs called the pre-frontal cortex.
Master level trolling
This is even 100% funnier cuz of how casual the question is lol
Virtually the entirety of human history is "evolution didn't give us this advantage, so let's build it ourselves"
Um... People can survive without shoes.  Many indigenous still do not wear shoes.
We actually did evolve "shoes", in fact most people who grow up / live barefoot have very rough, solid foot soles that let them walk around on rocks and such. Of course, shoes still prevent you from the odd pokey branch or pointy rock and regulate your body temperature, which is always nice.
Bro we evolved to rely on tools. If humans didn't use things our naked, squishy asses would be so low on the food chain lmao
Neil, do you drink fluoridated water and wash your hands and cook your food and not eat carrion off the ground?
I always like how Shaun calls people by their first names. I mean, I guess it‚Äôs sort of expected since he just goes by Shaun.
I don‚Äôt think this dude ever actually developed folds in his brain
You guys haven't evolved a skin like mask over your face? Oh....

*Skin mask release* 


Next evolution I'm getting an exoskeleton!
If planes were necessary we would have had wings by now
The response  completely blows him out of the water, no further comment is needed!
Does Neil walk around naked, and barefoot? Also, don‚Äôt give this man a vaccine because as he stated, he doesn‚Äôt need it if he hasn‚Äôt evolved to have it.
Wait a second, I'd recognize that skull anywhere!

Shaun, you beautiful, British, monotone bastard. Any content with Shaun in it is immediately 10/10
Imagine feeling the need to black out Shaun.
Shaun is just a powerhouse. I love the guy.
The virus isn't real. The human body has a way to shut that down.

"If we needed masks before now, people would have been getting sick and dying of illness. Wake up, sheeple."
I mean our dicks are naturally sheathed.  Evolution just hasn't had the time to get to our other head.
r/murderedbywords
Wow, Neil has gone off the deep end. Who is saying that masks are necessary for our species's survival? Literally no one thinks all humans will be wiped out by covid. We just think the natural burn-over death rate is too high to tolerate without action.
Neil, you‚Äôre fucking stupid
As a matter of fact. Neil does not. Neil doesn't have to. 


HE IS A HOBBIT

A proudfoot in fact. No a proudfeet.
I bet the Dinosaurs thought the same thing about an asteroid deflector
This is why the US is so fucked.
I love how the tweet he quoted or reference has since been deleted.
well, tbf if you condition your feet to act like shoes from a young age, you should be fine, right?
Pandemics have always existed, before medicine was a thing some people would die, some would live and then this people would continue developing. Thing is, if this happens now with our level of social dependence, I'm pretty sure almost no one would survive on it's own given society would collapse. What I'm trying to say is, use masks, respect medical doctors, and hopefully you won't die a painful death.
Neil do you wear trousers?
I think I just lost hope for us. I think I'm going to root for Covid now
I mean what this idiot is describing we actually have, our nostrils have a filtering system with the hairs and mucous membranes, so yes we have evolved to have a built in mask, except it does not work for every microscopic menace.
Is there some prize for stupid that he's trying so hard to win?
I sure do love my organ thats purely devoted to picking up internet signals
Is that the legend himself, Shaun?
Just like my meat, his argument got broken by a shoe
r/ShitAmericansSay
Why are your balls still external when your ancestors been getting em kicked in for centuries?
We evolved a big brain that knows how to make and when to use masks.
I feel physically and mentally ill after reading this.
We shouldn't have cars, if we really needed them we would have grown wheels on our feet and knees and would be driving around as God intended, had he infact intended, which he didn't, and thus cars are of the devil. Disney movie or otherwise.
Both of these have actually sorta been implemented in us anatomically. However, the artificial ways are better. 

Our nose hairs filter out some things. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs bad to wax the inside of your nose, and it‚Äôs best to breathe through your nose. 

Our feet can develop to have much tougher skin on the bottom. I have cousins who have a farm and they just walk through the forest with bare feet. Now, their skin on their feet is like leather.
Darwinsim giveth, and darwinism taketh
Yeah... wearing a piece of cloth on your face is really hard.  How fucking weak are these people?  What if they had to face real problems like poverty, homelessness?
What a dumb fucking idiot.
If stupidity was a mountain, we just found Everest
it‚Äôs almost like the human species creates things to make things easier...like the wheel or literally anything else
on top of that this idiot thinks an entire species could evolve in less than a year. on average an animal takes at least a million years to change their features to adapt. most of these hanges are unnoticeable. This takes even longer with humans at approx. 6 million years. please just wear a mask. I was today years old when i found out guys could be karens.
$5 says that he doesn't believe in evolution anyway
I bet this guy runs around naked
/u/nekkototoro in case you didn't realise blue check marks are classed as public figures so they don't need to be censored.
Neil, even though I want to like him, continues to disappoint me time after time
So wait does this mean I don't have to wear clothes anymore?
If clothes were necessary we would have evolved them by now
"Chip, in the 21st century Dunning-Kruger will be weaponized by politics".
Typically for a species to evolve a new trait many have to die from the disturbance that caused the need for the trait. So who knows, maybe Niel's great great grandchildren will have evolved masks after 99% of their genetic code has been wiped off the earth.

Or, he could just wear a mask, because even though he didn't, the rest of us evolved this cool "intelligence" trait which has helped us survive disturbances like disease.

If 2020 has shown me anything it has shown me just how disappointingly stupid human kind is. I know its not all (or even many) of us, but it is much more mind blowing than I ever thought.
To be fair you don't really need shoes. I grew up in the himalayas without them and got leathery tough hobbit feet.
Nose hairs are kinda a built in mask but i think most people trim those away.
I don't use cars because if traveling at 60 miles an hour was necessary people would have evolved motorized wheels by now.
That‚Äôs what your nose is for.  It was not designed to stop genetically modified shit.
Are we getting [Poe'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) here?
Why is he using a device connected to the internet to make his post? It's unnatural, wE sHoUlD'vE aLrEaDy eVoLvEd iT oThEr wIsE!
I know this isn‚Äôt the point and I agree this dude is straight up dumb. But I‚Äôm just throwing this out there, we don‚Äôt need shoes. Before shoes were created, humans had healthier feet and far less foot and leg injuries related to movement.
I bet someone read that and was like ‚ÄúTHATS FACTS RRIGHT THERE‚Äù

That‚Äôs the funny part
I hate the "it's not natural argument." 

Whether something is natural has no effect on whether it is good for you. Cars aren't natural. Pen and paper aren't natural. Soap isn't natural. toothbrushes aren't natural. 

It makes no sense that natural and unnatural have good and bad connotations respectively. Naturalness has no bearing on health. 

If living an all natural hunter gatherer life was the best, then people would still do it. You know what people without electricity say? They don't go, "Im so happy without these lights as distractions." What they actually say is, "Wow it would be so much better if we could see at night!"
FYI: **This guy, Neil Clark, is a hardcore pro-Russian op-ed columnist on Russian state media websites like RT and Sputnik.** He likes to repeat all of Russia‚Äôs lies about various events, like the MH17 shootdown, the Skirpal poisonings, etc.

Useful idiots like him can only be used by foreign forces due to their stupidity.
Jesus fucking Christ. 
The absolute stupidity of these cretins is staggering. 
In a weird way it‚Äôs comforting to know I‚Äôm not this dumb and therefore must be on the right side of history in this debate.
Considering most people wear glasses... shouldn‚Äôt we have evolved internal ones? So... not shitty eyes?
If house were necessary we'd have grown a shell like a crab.

Clothes aren't necessary either.

I invite this guy to go live like a cave man. Shouldn't be too much of a change.
If cancer wasn't necessary, we would have evolved to fight it.
Isn't it sad that he hasn't said anything political yet we can all tell with perfect accuracy that he is a republican, just by how dumb he is?
Clothes in general? Phones? Technology? Fucking fire? HELLO!?
If human beings were meant to go to war, we would've evolved guns, swords, turrets, and grenades.

If human beings were meant to travel faster than 10mph we would've evolved wheels, internal combustion engines and the ability to drink gasoline.

If humans were meant to fly we would've evolved wings.

If humans were meant to write we would've evolved with graphite fingernails and skin that shedded into sheets of paper.

If humans were meant to use submarines we would've evolved nuclear reactors and bodies able to withstand extreme pressure.

If humans were meant to go to space, they would've evolved a fuckto of things beyond my comprehension.
If it's a legit virus, your body would just shut that thing down
Bet this man doesn't wipe when he shits
Humans evolved the ability to have dexterity and intelligence to solve for immediate issues, allowing artificial adaptation to ensure survival. Sometimes something is too rough to handle with your bare hands. Did we evolve super tough burn proof hands? No. We made and wear gloves.

It looks like that intelligence dulled a bit for some of these dumbasses, but luckily there's plenty of people to pick up the slack. 

Same idea idiots, just put the fucking bit of cloth over your goddam faces you insatiably stupid morons.
Up until I was 12 or so I refused to wear sun glasses using the exact same logic. I thought my eyes would get used to the brightness. They didn't lol.
He does have a point.  If people can "evolve" glasses and contacts on their face and forks and knives on their hands, surely they would've "evolved" masks by now if they were important.
Okay he's done it, the DUMBEST possible argument against masks, I'm done.
using this logic, we don‚Äôt need clothes either
Why'd you bother censoring the names? I know who both of those people are.
I think Neil wears shoes, but I wonder who ties them for him....
How are these people this dense? 

Yes, the human species might survive a pandemic, but wearing masks and isolating and doing what the "govt propaganda" says will mean millions of dead instead of billions.
If this was 1903, this guy would say "If man were meant to fly, God would've given him wings".
Ima be always naked from now on because i havent evolved clothes by now
No, Neil is a Hobbit obviously.
Just wait until we evolve to not needing clothes. You‚Äôll be able to unzip a flan of skin and pack your dick into it like a fanny pack
Fucking love Shaun
Jesus.  The ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚Äúrights‚Äù this country has is gonna ruin it
Do you want to evolve masks? Because this is how that starts - everyone not wearing masks, then that flappy faced guy starts looking pretty good.
To be fair we don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù shoes
he better be running around naked, not have a house, or use any technology of any kind...

humans build tools. thats what we evolved to do. masks are a tool. you are a tool.
As a follow-up question: if you do wear shoes, who ties them for you?
My mom told me, similarly, ‚Äúyour body is a temple for God. If he wanted you to have your ears pierced you would have been born that way.‚Äù

Weeeeellll I‚Äôm also gay as hell... I was born that way. So by her logic, God wanted me to be gay then, right?
Neil doesn't wipe his ass because if that was important our asses would wipe themselves
Covid has made me scared to go outside. To an extent because I don‚Äôt want to catch it, but more so because I‚Äôve realized how many morons are walking around out there and procreating.
Clean kill.
we evolved boogars and nose hair...and a fucking immune system
 If food was necessary for survival, we would have been photosynthesizing by now.
Fuck I hope they're an American - I'd have asked about guns not evolving, or bullet resistant kevlar skin not evolving.
Carrying a protest sign doesn't protect your feet but apparently carrying a protest sign makes you immune from viruses(according to the press anyway)
I'm actually impressed that the dumbass at least concedes that evolution is a worthy argument, even if he shows no actual understanding of it....
It's always the amount of likes these posts get that bothers me the most.
If eating were necessary, we eould have evolved food in our stomach by now
Not only do we speak.

We have to wear masks cause we overpopulated our habitat and we have to

'express that 'we matter' and or of some worth' to other memembers of our species because every one wants to KILL each other over a GOD that does not exist and HATE of someone that is another color for any or NO reason has to exclaim that they matter ....  S A D
All these clowns say listen to the science and experts, then a scientist says something you don't like and he's stupid. Bunch of clowns.
"it's not natural" he says, as he gorges on artificial everything.
Unpopular opinion, but shoes are kinda fucking us over. Check out a book called born to run
The response is absolute gold though.
I can't believe I have to live in a universe where people think not wearing a mask will cause the evolution of Humanity. Its even worse I'm not making this shit up.
So I guess he has never heard of nose hairs before...

"[Nose hairs trap dirt, viruses, bacteria and toxins until we blow them out, sneeze, or swallow. "](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-12/fyi-whats-point-nose-hair/)
Hold on lemme just evolve a flesh mask real quick
It‚Äôs a simple spell, but quite unbreakable
We‚Äôre trying.  
For physical filtration, evolution has so far only been able to come up with a combination of snot and nose hair, though...
The biggest surprise is Neil believing in evolution
He doesn't need clothing too because he's got a full meat skin suit on.
I guess we should run around naked too.  We haven evolved clothes and the government tells we have to.
You guys haven't evolved shoes yet?
Omfg I thought this was Neil deGrasse Tyson and I was really concerned
We have evolved a mask, inside, it's Calle immune system, but it's always good to assist what's already there
If moving at 60+mph were necessary, we would have evolved to have engines and wheels on our body.


But my gimpy ass still hobbles to the car on a regular basis
Neil, do you wear any clothes? Yes? YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT SHEEP DONT BE SO GULLIBLE BY DOING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING
Man I love Shaun
Bruh
Does food grow in your hand?‚úã
Well its impossible for humans to evolve so people shouldnt tweet things that are stupid
The immediate response to the post is perfection.
Perfect response. What a goober
Destroyed in 5 words. Nice
You only evolve something if you constantly need it for 1000's years. You don't just grow a flesh mask when you get the cold.
He clearly doesn‚Äôt know how long it takes to evolve something like that
Except we did evolve masks....nose hairs filter the air that passes through your nostrils.
TIL shoes are necessary to survive
I mean, this is technically true right? 

Masks are not "necessary for our survival as a species". 

I think that might be what he is missing. A fire department is also not, neither are police, neither are hospitals . . . 

honestly it's pretty hard to think of literally ANYTHING that is "necessary for our survival as a species" that is a physical thing we have. we could survive in caves w/ fires and drinking nothing but rain. I would imagine. SOME humans would live.
Shouldn‚Äôt happen in a developed country

Because I live 50 miles from Ontario, I was lucky enough to get insulin from Canada as often as possible.   Thanks, Canada!  While my own country let me down, you were my True North, Strong and Free!
Imagine if drug dealers sold insulin. 

That‚Äôd be some Robin Hood shit.
I honestly can‚Äôt get my head around it all. Such a baseline measure of a first world country - to be able to keep the population in healthcare. I know I‚Äôm blessed given I was born into a country with the NHS but I would rather wait on a list for non urgent healthcare than have to make the choice between insulin and electricity. It‚Äôs one of the biggest killers of the ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù to me.
Being disabled in America is a nightmare. Thousands of dollars spent for the doctors to tell me I wasn‚Äôt having seizures when I already told them multiple times I Don‚Äôt Get Seizures.
My mother has been a diabetic for almost 50 years.  If my dad hadn‚Äôt been in the military, she‚Äôd probably be dead now. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much life saving medication costs in the country.
I live in Australia, earn 60k a year and get access to universal health care, I pay $800 a month in tax

I can't imagine living on the American system
Insulin in Canada costs $75 to $120 a month if you dont have insurance.  Free if you dont earn enough to pay for insurance.  The USA is not the richest country in the world. It is the poorest country in the G7 by far.  If you measure assets of he average person ( including government health care).   America is only rich if you average in the wealth of the top 1% and they dont share and they dont pay taxes.
The people who discovered insulin refused to profit from it. They thought it was too important. So why does it cost so much in usa?
Insulin costs about $50 to $70 per patient, per year to produce. Banting and Best gave up the patent rights for free so it would not be withheld from people due it exorbitant prices... Yet here we are, 2020 and the age of Big Pharma.
The real death panels were already here.
I recently learned that medical tourism is a thing. This is why.
Uk: ¬£9 per prescription......if you can afford it. If not its free. Or ¬£100 for a whole years worth. 
Any drug. Any time. No insurance. No deductible. 

For Americans that $12.
A good friend of mine is type 1.  This scares me shitless, she is 23 now.  I do hope things change in the next three years
Jesus h Christ, I throw out full vials, pens, cartridges all the damn time. (It‚Äôs law, I have to as a nurse) üá®üá¶
A friend of mine, 44, female, an attorney, just lost her battle with type 1 diabetes. She went into a coma, because she had to ration her insulin. This, because covid shut down the courts, and because she wasnt working, her health insurance was canceled. Her employer shut down. 

She died, because of coronavirus, but it wasn‚Äôt the direct cause. 

Our healthcare system sucks. And Trump wants to cut it back, all the while, he gets the best care available and downplays the virus.
Walmart has cheap insulin in a pinch. No prescription needed. When my husband couldn't afford his pens we had to use it for a bit. Called his doctor and explained what was going on. Dr gave him the dosage he needed.
A woman who lied to get her kids healthcare was recently sentenced *up to* 27 years in prison.

edit: added "up to", as if that changes the underlying point
What the hell I thought he lived in America. Is it America or the richest country in the world? They are not the same place
His name is Alec Smith and he deserves to at least have his name spelled correctly. He was a good friend, a good man and a great father.
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT
The entirety of insurance and healthcare in the United States is one big fucking racket. Completely littered with greed and the desire to fuck people in the ass for every dollar they can get.
$13,000 a year in out of pocket costs w/ insurance, or $15,600 to just pay cash.  It's like what the fuck is the point of insurance
But...but... Trump said that he made insulin as cheap as water.

He wouldn't lie would he?
/s
Sounds like we need some anti trust and campaign finance action.

Perhaps a sprinkle of term limits and nixing of the everlasting healthcare for them are in order too.

Remember when the dude who invented insulin didn't patent it so everyone could have affordable access to it?
I've said it before and I'll say it again. I am sure  people will argue but the U.S isn't a "developed" country. It's still has the death penalty, Healthcare isn't universally available or affordable,  No paid pregnancy's leave, the justice system is corrupt. The government isn't functional. I like living here but it still far behind.
What happens if you go to prison? Do the government pay for your meds?
Curious why his payments were so high; with that salary wouldn‚Äôt he be able to get a subsidized plan through the government exchange for a lot less? Turning 26 he was open to enroll whenever he wanted. I had a plan a few years ago that i bought out of pocket, completely unsubsidized too, directly from the insurance provider, it was a PPO plan with I believe a 5000 deductible, and that was ‚Äúonly‚Äù about $200 a month. 

US healthcare is fucked up, but something about this story isn‚Äôt holding together... I‚Äôm reading more about the story, all I found substantiated was that he and him mom searched for plans, and she says this was the best option they could find. That‚Äôs not in line with my experiences at all, and it‚Äôs not like they can charge him more for a pre-existing condition. I feel like a dick for saying this, but it kind of sounds like they didn‚Äôt look very hard for options...

That said it‚Äôs FUCKED that that situation could even arise, and the insulin game is completely unethical. I‚Äôm just very skeptical about this story at face value in a post Obamacare US healthcare system.
I'm wondering what State he was from? I too am diabetic. I live in NY. We have Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus. If you qualify for Medicaid, you have no premium. After that there are 3 tiers of premiums. The higher your income, the higher the tier. When I had it, they were $9, $15, and $119/month. Everyone in NYS qualifies. Now I couldn't afford my ridiculous premiums through my work either. So I went on this insurance. I had a choice. Then my insulin was free or $5/month if there was no generic. I honestly thought most if not all States had this kind of program.
Are we great yet?
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but didn‚Äôt the person who discovered insulin want it to be very cheap? Or am I living in a fantasy world/thinking of something else?
As an Australian I find your medical system shocking. Even worse is that not everyone is for Medicare for all. I mean there are many things I find surprising but this is the 1 thing you really need to get behind. Too late this election but next election make sure you are voting for someone that will provide you healthcare. From the outside looking in it looks like prioritising pharma profits over lives.
Insulin in Sweden is free. Period. One of few medications that are 100% free for those in need of it. I'm quite lucky to have it that way, and more diabetics should have it that way.
If we didn‚Äôt have the patent laws. as most other countries dont, insulin and epi pens and other drugs would be astronomically cheaper.
It doesn't. It's time to stop pretending America is developed.
If I were in a position to have any authority to do anything about such incidents, I couldn‚Äôt have been able to live with myself after seeing these. Poor guy. I imagine the despair he must‚Äôve felt when he started rationing his insuline. I‚Äôm sorry bro,all that wealth and they couldn‚Äôt keep you alive.
I live here in the old USA and I must say...we are a well off third world country. They only thing we have going for us in all reality is that oil is sold on the American Dollar. If that ever changes we are goners.
I'm in the UK and this would cost me nothing, for life (though luckily I don't need insulin). I only recently discovered in the US you have to pay for ambulances. This is atrocious.
I thought insulin was as cheap as water. That's what Trump said at the debate so it must be true.

/s
As an outsider looking in from a demonstratably better country why do you guys put up with that shit?
As a an ex diabetes educator, we need more information about this story. To the untrained ear it sounds horrible. But I really need to know the full story. I wouldn't be surprised if he was already in poor condition before he got off the insurance. Does anyone have more information on this sensationalized reddit post?
Blame conservatives who do vote and liberals who don't.
It's not the country that's rich. Its just few individuals. And they will get fewer with time.
"richest country"? My ass, u mean richest 1% who don't care about you....
Maybe one day the us will learn from the EU
"They call it the American dream because you'd have to be sleeping to believe it!" - George Carlin
It's truly laughable that America STILL sees itself as the greatest nation all the while shit like this keeps happening. Take a look around and see where you can learn..
America is not a developed country. All other developed countries are social democracies. America is the only one that isn't and it cannot provide anything for it's people. There are 3rd world countries with better standards of living for people.
The numbers is just absurd in the US. 

I pay (in Sweden) roughly 200 USD per year for my health insurance. And medication like insulin is free in Sweden. All other medicines has a maximum yearly cost of roughly 210 USD. If your medication costs more than that per year (prescription medication) the government pays for all the costs above 210 USD.

Land of the free you say? US is a undeveloped country with a first class paint job.

Shithole
‚ÄúWell if he was planning on having diabetes he should‚Äôve got a better job!‚Äù ~America
As a type 1 diabetic at the age of 25 ( Diagnosed at 3 years old ) turning 26 in a few months.. this scares the shit out of me. And I'm working in Healthcare as a Medical Assistant. Is this my fate too??!?
I didn‚Äôt realise this happened in Qatar
This is fucking insane
In my country the government will buy the medicine for you if you can‚Äôt afford it. If you‚Äôre low income you can ask for government support, and everyone will get a higher and higher percentage refund depending on how much they spend on medicine. 
Needles, pokers, blood-glucose measurer (even the new ones that are installed in the arm and can read your blood-glucose levels without poking) you can get for free. 
Insulin will cost 50$ for an average month supply before personal discounts and refunds are counted. 

It‚Äôs sickening that people have to die because they can‚Äôt afford basic medicine that are readily and bountifully available. A country that doesn‚Äôt invest in its citizens wellbeing will be the downfall of it self.
This makes me sick
Do you guys not have bootstraps?
Too bad, tough luck. That's what all the MAGA punks say.
Excuse my simple mind but what's stopping me who lives in a country with affordable insulin to mail a few vials every month to those who can't afford it in America?
M4A.

No substitutions. No compromises.

Anything else is criminal or immoral. Anything but M4A is trying to insert profit motive middlemen into the equation.

Healthcare is a human right. We already pay more than anyone for less access, less quality.
In case anyone was wondering like I was:

This simultaneously infuriates me and breaks my heart.
THANKS TRUMP
That‚Äôs fucking tragic and entirely believable. Even if someone made this up, I‚Äôm a 26 year old male living in America and I just got cut off from my parents insurance. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to afford my own, pay for my inhalers, and get an anti depressant subscription. And let‚Äôs fucking hope I don‚Äôt get injured while I have none. This country doesn‚Äôt give one single shit if I live or die, they just want my money. And I am depressed every day knowing that I‚Äôm nothing more than a taxable body. Rant over. Apologies.
Trump said it was a cheap as water in the debate?
And here in England if you have a condition which will last for life even if you work you do not have to pay for the prescription.

Glad I live here and hope the Tories dont privates our NHS.  I'm more than willing for my taxes to go to peoples health and schooling than the MPs getting another pay rise.
makes me upset to think about the number of friends i have who would still be alive if they were born in almost any other country besides the US.
The US is just a 3rd-world banana republic which tells itself that it's the GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD so much that it believed its own bullshit.
America‚Äôs health care is fucked. 7-8 years ago my younger cousin (who was 8-9 at the time) started having major heart problems. She needed surgeries and was in the hospital and rehab for months. Luckily we live in Canada but my family was saying how if we were in America, the amount of money it would have cost would have made the family bankrupt. 

The sad thing is that the same thing happens to many people south of the boarder and just because the idiot politicians, so many Americans die unnecessarily or they go broke trying not to die. 

People shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between bankruptcy or death.
No matter who wins the presidency in November this will not change.
Bro this is absolutely fucking disgusting, Bernie sanders was really your only hope but you blew it
Alot of people commenting seem to be a bit ignorant. Being disabled is expensive.
I‚Äôm not diabetic, but I am an American teenager who‚Äôs about to graduate high school and has no idea how she‚Äôll pay for anything. I‚Äôm sick (incurable brain disorder) and my medications are expensive. Scans at the hospital are expensive, as is bloodwork, neurologist appointments, and surgeries.

I really want to go to college (my end goal is to become a chemist; I love chemistry and just the idea of working in a lab makes me smile), but my grades aren‚Äôt good enough to get me an academic scholarship and I‚Äôm no athlete, so getting noticed for sports isn‚Äôt going to happen. You get the idea. My plan for now is to take a year off after I graduate high school to figure things out (get okay financially, figure out what college I‚Äôd like to go to, whether I‚Äôm staying with my mom or if I‚Äôd be able to get a studio apartment or something like that‚Äîetcetera).

This may sound selfish or self-centered, but I hate that a country that‚Äôs so wealthy and supposedly ‚Äúthe best‚Äù would have such terrible healthcare. I‚Äôm doing as well as I can, but the fact that even after insurance my mom is still paying hundreds of dollars per bottle... Well, it fucking sucks, to say the least.
It's sad that my Canadian cat with diabetes got the insulin it needed but this man couldn't.
The USA is a joke and all Americans should be embarrassed.
Everytime I see a post about diabetes and America I find I'm so incredibly thankful to be loving in NZ. Added bonus, our prime minister listened to experts in regard to covid instead of ignoring a global pandemic.
Republican = Insane
That's just utterly heartbreaking. It's shit like this that makes me wish the NHS was a world wide service to save people like him.
Third world country USA.
Or you could just elect Bernie to office, have socialized medicine like all the other 'advanced nations' on the planet, and actually 'look out for your fellow man'.

&#x200B;

In USA the sick and dying are worth far more than those that are healthy.

You are an exploitable resource, the Golden Udder of Income...and you are all equally milked in turn.
Come on Americans, just harden up and stop being so scared of universal healthcare, its awesome. Seriously.
And then people say "Healthcare is communism"
First of all That guy could have went to a Walmart. They sell old school insulin, without prescription BTW, for $25 a vial. It's not the best solution but it works. I only use 2-3 vials a month.  So for 50-75 a month he would have been fine.
Gotta stop the Big Pharma company's from slightly changing insulin in order reapply for a patent. Technically it's legal but it doesn't allow for any competition. Inherently anti-capitalist.
The worst part is that it only costs upwards of 130-150 dollars to produce a year's supply of insulin. Frick capitalism.
Currently there are 7.4 million people who require insulin in the USA. If you multiply that number by 1,300, which im assuming is the average cost per month, times 12, you get the annual cost of insulin for the entire country,  115,440,000,000 PER YEAR. Medicare for all isn't feasible unless you deal with big pharma first. Posts like this are fucking stupid. Other countries can bargain pharmasutical prices, if we could do that the price for medicare for all would plummet, but idiots think that we can print money out of thin air apparently.
People like to say this issue on this is health insurance and how the gov should help pay and shit like that... but no one mentions how big pharmaceutical has a government created monopoly and is funded massively by our taxes... we‚Äôre asking government to help pay for drug that are so expensive as a direct result of things the government has done... instead of asking for the government to pay for these expensive drugs, why don‚Äôt we start asking the government to stop doing the things that allow for these drugs to get so expensive?
$450 a month??? WTF??

I'm in Canada and I pay $150 a month for private insurance so I have dental/prescription drug coverage. My dental deductible is $25 a year and I have no idea what my drug deductible is, but it's small enough that I don't notice it. I cannot imagine $450/month and $7600 deductible. It is literally a business model designed to kill or bankrupt you. Whichever comes first.
This shit is fucking infuriating.   I lean right and the pharma companies are even beyond conscionable...   things that have been around for 30+ years and have paid off the R&D that went into them 100 fold.    Shits stupid    No business has the right to do that the government needs to do something when it comes down to shit like that.   Not just pay for it.   Punish those who exploit the weak and sick... vile ass dogs
The pharmaceutical companies are really bleeding people dry. It‚Äôs an issue all right.
The US is the laughingstock for the entire developed world. It's not a mocking laugh by this point. It's like the awkward nervous laugh you do when someone tells you something too personal that gets you uncomfortable.
‚ÄúRandom picture of a guy with words on it bad about USA. Must be true. Must upvote‚Äù

-all the bots in this thread
you realize this is because there is a monopoly on insulin production....

In our biology class we genetically engineered bacteria to flouresce under uv light, and insulin production is also genetically engineered....

IT costs like pennies to make but one company owns it. Free market enterprise and competition is the only way to lower the price of insulin... Allow random people to manufacture it in their garage and get it fda inspected..... prices will drop.

Us is not the richest country in the world. It‚Äôs a fucking 3rd grade country as well. There are like 50 country‚Äôs that have better standards to live in. It‚Äôs just Americans don‚Äôt realize that cause to them their nation is the world, they have no clue about the actual world. It‚Äôs very similar to North Korea when I think about it.
Same...

That's what happens when you view politics as a sporting event.
At this stage there's really no point in pretending. This is who we are as a people.
They can't even admit that he didn't even live up to hardly any of his promises. Where's the manufacturering coming back, Where's coal, Where's Mexico paying for the wall?
They blame the last 4 years on the other side. The two parties are living in different realities, there's no common ground based in fact.

Did Mueller's report find no wrongdoing by the Trump Campaign in 2016? Depends on who you ask.

Was impeachment a hoax? Depends on who you ask.

I can't believe there isn't a consensus on impeachment. One of the biggest political events that can happen, and an entire constituency of a party is digging their heads in the sand. It baffles me that people can still be so ignorant about the impeachment and not care.
Reminds me of a quote. 

‚ÄúTake the most average person you know. Half the country is stupider than that.‚Äù

They don‚Äôt have the education level to tell they‚Äôre being duped. The ten least educated states? Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky, South Carolina, Nevada, New Mexico, and Tennessee. Of those, Nevada is barely blue and tbh I‚Äôm not sure why New Mexico is, but I appreciate it.

I‚Äôll save you the look, but every single one of the top ten is blue.

This country needs education BADLY.

To be honest. If he does win again, the laws should be changed to make his behaviour legal for everyone. Re-electing him is basically admitting that Americans are okay with it.
As my parents put it ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre terrified of Biden-Harris, they‚Äôll destroy the country, so we have no choice‚Äù
...yeah, I don‚Äôt get it either. It‚Äôs very hard for me not to argue
Well... They feed off the misery of others. The 230k dead from covid-19, children in cages at the border, regular news of cops killing black people with zero consequences, white supremacists being given the lock and load order, the casual cruelty and overt racism / sexism / xenophobia, the glorification of a sexual predator with two dozen credible allegations against him, domestic terrorists planning to kidnap and murder a govenor... This is all good, in their eyes. This is justified. Because the left is the problem, the left is the danger. So whatever vile, reprehensible, evil, selfish, petty, destructive and childish thing they do, it's fine.

Because owning the libs is so much more important than working to actually make the country a better place for everyone. They live the scorched earth mentality, and they have lived it since Nixon. If they must burn the world for five more minutes of power, they'll throw their children in as kindling.

They just don't care. It's all about power and nothing else matters.

Edit 1 ; Thank you all for the gifts. It is sad that such a comment would receive any kind of reward or award. These are strange times. The very worst of the US culture is in full view. What was insane and unacceptable 30 years ago is now mainstream. The party of Lincoln is now the party of Nixon. The rise of the violent, intolerant right is real and it is happening right now.
Then you remember the Fox News fantasy world draws a bigger audience than CNN and MSNBC combined.
They *really* hate being told that they're acting like assholes--seriously, I think that's a bigger basic chunk of this than a lot of people want to admit.
But according to the right america will be even worse with biden as president so we know what were dealing with here.
Biden just won Wisconsin! And the incoming votes are predicted to be mostly Democtats.
Jokes on you, he was actually talking about Destiny
I didn't expect Paul to pop up here.
The other reason is that Dems have been terrible at messaging and playing politics for the last 4 decades. The Dems are incompetent.
They don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs doing it. As long as it‚Äôs a republican
Biden promised to go back to Obama era politics and perhaps that was the glitch. Perhaps the 50 millionish Americans that slipped into poverty under the financial crisis are thinking "yeah sure, more of that please".  Their kids are old enough to vote now which might be bringing their number up some

Do not ever forget that Obama's cabinet was filled with Citibank and Goldman Sachs people.  He not only bailed the banks out but remember what it was like having to sit back and watch those same bankers get bonuses while people were losing their homes and livelyhoods?  Obama did that and those folks are still bitter as all hell

Instead of a promise to go backwards Biden should have  talked about the future and made a plan for it that led with policy.  Good democratic policy.  Instead he sidled up with Bush era republicans. Remember that Biden and Obama together helped make over 80% of Bush Jr/GOP tax cuts for the rich permanent.  They're all buddies.

What I do not understand is how any of us can be loyal to either party at this stage.  This mess is all about a controlled opposition and we allow both parties and their masters to play us all for fools...every time
I mean if you look from the average person perspective. Someone who doesn‚Äôt use reddit or Twitter, the only really bad stuff they will see is what has happened this year. Not everyone sees how much of a piece of crap trump is, for the simple reason of avoiding the news with how toxic it is.
 Because a large portion of the people who would normally vote against that have been turned off of the idea that they *need* to vote for the lesser of two evils. Trumpnis obviously incompetent but he appeals to basically *all* of the Right wing. There's a significant portion of the Left wing that is extremely disaffected by Democrats. What's worse is that the Democratic party doesn't seem to care.
It's because of learned helplessness, apathy and indifference and a total lack of critical thinking skills.
Agreed. If Biden wins, it will be a hollow victory.
Ideologues and zealots. They believe anyone claiming to be "conservative" is governing by the handful of core principles they believe in, such as "government that governs best governs least" , Run the country like a business, don't give handouts to welfare queens, ban abortion etc.  Regardless of whether those principles work, regardless of whether there's actually such a thing as a welfare queen,  regardless of whether the candidate actually adheres to those principles.  Their brains can only hold on to 2-3 core issues, and their brains can't accept data that contradicts any of them, there's literally no extra space/computing power left over.  It's completely delusional.
RIGHT?!?!
Last 4 years? How about since the early 80s
The hundreds of millions allocated for cyber election security was never spent. Hmmm wonder if that could have been a reason???
Is american stupidity and delusion a new concept to you? They always choose the conman.

This is why you people need to get rid of electoral college ...
Nevertheless still wondering how it is possible for him to get more than 40 % of voters. Only answer is radicalism
Death. Cult.
Ummm I absolutely can believe that they would want the average of the last 4 years.  When most of them are white and don‚Äôt have to deal with racism or rich or upper middle class and don‚Äôt have to deal with the issues of poverty, when your children are in bed not being held in a cage and you glance at your high performing stock investments.  Yeah I can absolutely see who half the country still wants to vote for him, especially because most conservatives don‚Äôt at all see the coronavirus as his fault.  They don‚Äôt think he could have done anything differently and that covid shouldn‚Äôt factor into why you should want to elect trump.
My God... I have been saying this to myself since last night.
Amen
Im an outsider but I can‚Äôt help but laugh. I see all this hate to the current President but the race is so tight it actually seems like more of you are voting for the Party than what you‚Äôll are putting on. 

Hate or not. But its the Truth 
Or theres only the Blue Party that is represented here or brave enough to talk smack about the other Party. 

Either way you‚Äôll country and the infighting just a laughing stock to me.
