I'm 17 years old and just finished building this 14.7" f/2.89 Newtonian reflector telescope. Despite its stubby size it collects roughly 2500 times more light than the human eye and is bigger than the scope at my local observatory.

I had absolutely no idea one could build a telescope of this size and scale at home, but this is awesome! Just, like whoa, incredible, man.

[How to make your own telescope and mirror](https://stellafane.org/tm/index.html) - Very easy plans, you can build your own scope for a few hundred bucks and with basic tools. Mirror is a little harder but I've made a 6" with little difficulty - while it is time-consuming it's a perfect project to work on at home!

Also if you're interested in building a scope check out /r/atming, have posted some good resources there too

I really want to stress that anybody, and I mean *anybody*, can do this! Telescope making and astronomy are no harder than building a PC and look how many folks do that!

Okay, some more edits since this is pretty visible:

* HIGHLY recommend joining your local astronomy club. Even if you can't physically visit right now there are still tons of great resources you can access and folks you can meet! Plus a lot of clubs can really use the cash - astro is kinda a niche hobby!

* This scope is NOT usable for astrophotography. Isn't designed to be.

* Over 210,000 upvotes - thank you all so much!

* Thanks for the gold and awards, kind strangers!

Again, TYSM everyone!
".. bigger than the scope at my local observatory."

That's a pretty damn good science flex if I ever saw one.

Edit: My first award, thanks stranger! But if anyone feels like they want to give any awards, give it to the man of the post because he definitely deserves it!
Thinking back on it, I’m not sure I’ve ever actually used a telescope.
You're telling me that the person who runs the best telescope review site on the web and who writes the r/telescopes recommendations, as well as builds their own amazing telescopes, is only 17?!
When I was your age I made a sims plumbob out of green paper and wire.

Your creation is far more impressive. Be proud!
This really inspires me to be more productive during quarantine...
When I was 17 I was building gravity bongs out of old milk jugs.  We are not the same.
That's the coolest most inspiring thing I have seen on Reddit today, rock on dude.
I am 66 and had a good shit this morning...thats my idea of success these days...good luck to you Son...I hope there is a world in the future for you to enjoy..
I'm almost 30 and I taped a stick to another stick to reach the itch on my back.
Sweeeeeet! Congrats young man. I have scope envy. Are you into astrophotography?
Flex a bit more. Send the pic to Ford Motor Company. Scholarship or a new car could come your way! (Shhh, flip it).
You are by far the coolest nerd I’ve ever seen.

Keep up the good work man,   The world needs people like you!
So cool!! Where do you get one of these bad boys?
You should do an AMA. You seem to have a pretty fascinating and full life. Telescope is really rad!
How long did it take to build? I know nothing about telescope building but since you posted some cool links I may get into it; seems like something I’d enjoy.
Nice socks, I have like 2 dozen pairs of them and they’re super comfy.
Absolutely magnificent! Cheers to you, young lad. We shall watch your career with great interest.
I always think I’m a pretty big nerd and then guys like this come around and remind me that I’m not really a nerd, I’m just uncool.
Physicist here. Hope you’re planning on pursuing Astro/astrophysics. If so, I bet I’ll be reading about you one day. If not, whatever field you choose will be lucky to get you. 

Outstanding.
First week of quarantine...

Builds amazing telescope

What are you gonna accomplish in the next 6-24 months of downtime???

Amazing !!!
As a fellow 17 year old, my respect for you is immeasurable
That’s awesome man. 

What do you think about starlink effecting amateur astronomers?
That’s so impressive! Youre going to be doing amazing things! Congrats man that’s so awesome!!!
This is extremely impressive and you're 17 years old. You have a bright future ahead of you my dude.
Is this viral marketing for the inevitable Teenage Sheldon show?
Im 30 years old and made a pancake today that was just to die for.
If you’re not documenting all of this in your Engineering Portfolio yet, you should start immediately.
[deleted]
This is amazing, you are a badass, I'm in awe.
I wish I had been this cool when I was 17. That's fucking bad ass.
Nice job. That's a very fast mirror. How are you correcting for coma in the off-axis field? Do you have an pre-eyepiece corrector?
This is really uplifting. I am truly amazed! Remember - sky is not the limit ;)
I’m 17 and I just learnt how to make macaroni n cheese
Dude please I beg of u save some pussy for the rest of us
Fuck yeah. Great job dude. Now go fuck all the nerd ladies.
And here I am 28 and struggling to finish my bachelor's while trying not to die in apex legends
This kid accomplished more before he was an adult and than I will in my entire life.

You're amazing man! What sparked your curiosity for telescopes, space, and astronomy? What got you into it?
This is freaking awesome you built that??!?! You sir are my new hero. I’ve got a hand me down telescope, nothing like what you built, that I’ve been trying to fix and use. I’m almost done but I’m missing a specific lens that is apparently no longer made? It’s an “antique” telescope but by antique I mean it’s from the 60s. It’s huge. Not the kind of telescope hobbyists would have invested in. 

Anyway all I’m missing is one lens and if you can make your own entire set up? I think I maybe can make my own lens to fit. 

Thanks for posting this! I feel inspired. 

Seriously and  I’m not messing with you. Seeing your post has genuinely inspired me to not drop my project. Thankyou!
I just dinged 60 in WoW when I was 17... Today I dinged 60 on my alt...

But nice work! Would love to see some pictures from this bad boy :D
But can you see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
How would an average Joe even begin to go about building a telescope from scratch let alone this size? I'm jelly and impressed to say the least and I'm a decade older too
Hope you busting open as much pussy as you are these stars king
Dude you frickin rock! I got my first reflector telescope when I was 17! Though i didn't make it myself haha.
I played Doom and made Beef Rouladen today, so I'm something of a scientist myself.
How much did this cost you to build? And where can one find a parts list?
Not only do I envy your skill. I envy the Karma you got from this post and its comments.
I’m 17 too and I really want one but I don’t have the money :(
Man you are an amazing human.. damn we are some pretty cool apes ahahahaha
[u/\_\_Augustus\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__Augustus_/) Do you have schematics for this? I'm no astrologist but I'd love to know how it works and if its a possibility to build my own!
Leave some pussy for the rest of us. Don't hoard. Wtf.
I'm 34 years old and I finally got around to taking down my Christmas lights.
I’m 32 years old. I broke down and cried because I messed up putting up a backsplash tile
I’ve never seen so many Reddit awards on a sub before. To build a stronger telescope that the local observatory, you earn them!
Quarantine really brings out the best in people huh
Dude...

Chill.

Save some women for the rest of us jeez
Wooooow!  You are the kind of person Elon Musk is looking for!
That’s very impressive. I hope your goals with this tool.
I saw this in make magazine back in 2015 and always planned on making one, but just never found the time and energy so congratulations to you!
Day 6 of quarantine this guy has built a telescope and all I've done is watch Netflix
High school wont be your years kid. College though, you'll be known as the Newtonian pipe layer.
Two questions 
First : how much cost to build this awesome telescope ?
 Second : any recommendation for first telescope for total noob ?
Just a simple congratulations...keep up the great work!

This is the ultimate flex, having a bigger telescope than the local observatory.
Saw this post at 4999 comments.Commenting it make it 5000. BTW that's a cool science project and ATB for all your future science adventures.
Awesome brother! You've got big things ahead of you.
You effin' *rock*!!

My kids (13 & 9) will be seeing & if possible,  following. Absotively, posilutely awesome. You deserve to be able to break your arm patting yourself on the back. Rock on, my dude.

This was his final picture before he drowned in puss
Guy wants special treatment cause he’s 17. I see a one trick pony .
Wow OP, that's a lot of shitposting on /r/the_donald in your post history. I don't think you're a very good person.
Someone call nasa and tell them to check this out
Good for you kid. Find what you like and apply yourself. Keep at it.
You're killing it kid! With those skills at such a young ags, the galaxy is your oyster!
Dude got 120k upvotes for putting together a kit the fuck
Beautiful mind! There is still hope for us humans while there are 17 y.o. boys like you!
This kid at 17: builds insanely powerful telescope by himself.

Me at 17: furiously masturbating in the shed to old Playboy magazines my brother left when he joined the military.
Is that a 14.7" telescope or are you just happy to see me?
Well done sir. I built a 6inch Newton in reflector with a dobson base about 28 years ago. Sadly it is in bad shape but I still have it.
Was this from scratch or was a it a DIY kit ?Edit never mind I read further
Awesome job! Had been thinking about building myself but my problem is that im living in an area with too much light polution (Netherlands) so anything that I want to use myself needs to be portable for me to take it in the field a couple of KMs from here. Building myself would/will be a major accomplishment and a long time thing to cross of my to-do/bucket list. Again, you did a great job.
As a former telescope operator of a 2.5-m telescope, I'm jealous! Congratulations and nicely done! Building my own telescope has been something I've wanted to do for quite a few years now but haven't had the time.

So tell me, why did you build one when you could have purchased one? Did you simply want the experience or wanted something specific you couldn't buy?
You have a good future ahead of you if you stick to this path!
This is incredible! Keep it up man, what you are doing is very impressive.
Hey op, have you played around with black 3.0 for internal reflection removal? I've heard that reason bandied about as use cases for black3 and vantablack, but haven't heard any reviews from telescope makers
You’re killing it kid. Keep being you and doing what you love.
I wish I had your determination and talent. Keep it up!
How did you get the prime mirror for your scope? Was it off-the-shelf?
William Herschel didn't make his own telescope until he was 36 years old! Kudos!
I can't really identify anything on your shelf or in that pile... I'm going to go ahead and assume your smarter than me. Good job kid
With all the light pollution, do you need to bring that thing out of town to use it effectively?
Wow awesome! Where do you source the parts from?
Jeez, and here I am proud of my peanut butter sandwich.

Great job dude, not everybody gets to brag about something like this.  Really cool stuff.
That is so awesome !

Proud of you !

Wish that I had co-workers that could apply deeper thought into their on-the-job responsibilities.
Mad props! My dad used to make telescopes from scratch, including shaping the lenses and mirror. I miss going to star parties with them.
Stupid question but do you put something around the open middle part or are you not worried about light pollution during usage? I had a friend make one like this but it was very bulky and hard to move around as the frame was mostly a giant wooden box.
What kind of music do you enjoy? Curious to see what music is preferred by someone with your skill set/accomplishments as well as your drive. I know that has nothing to do with anything but like I said, I'm curious.
OK kid, this old science boomer is giving you TWO BIG THUMBS UP!
Have you ever read the book "The Dobsonian Telescope"? Highly recommend.
15" at f2.89? That's incredible, can't wait for some photos!
That’s awesome!!! Congrats! That’s lots of hard work, dedication, and talent.
It’s always crazy to me how significantly more intelligent people are than I am. Keep it up man!
Man, you have the makings of a professional astronomer. I hope you like calculus!!
What’s your personality like? Are you more big picture or myopic?
 Very cool, man.  This is awesome!  I'm sure there is more to come. :)
This is pretty inspirational bro! Makes me want to learn how to build one myself! Nice job!!
That's an amazing accomplishment!! Congratulations!! I don't even know you yet I'm proud of you. You are gonna do amazing things in life. Is your focus gonna be astronomy or any of the sort?? Or are you leaning towards the engineer side?? Do you have a subreddit I can follow.. feel weird asking cuz you're only 17 but I admire your intelligence!!
Do you rotate the secondary mirror to stack images with alt az mounts or do you just rotate the images in post?
Hell of a job! Congrats on this project. Wishing you all the best in your future.
The telescope, the fact that you built it, the Ford shirt. My dude, I wanna be your friend
That's pretty awesome. About how much did you spend to finish it?
this is completely bananas in the best way! amazing!
This is awesome. 

I’ve always found F stops so hard to understand and your post has confused me even more. 

My 50mm prime shoots at f1.4, what would your insane telescope be the equivalent of in a camera format?
Hahah I thought this was a bbq at first before reading the caption, pretty neat though, nice one!
Compensating much? ;-) Seriously though very impressive!
Well executed my dude. 

Post some of the images you capture if you can!
Nice job.  I have never built one myself but have bought many damaged or trashed OTAs and repaired them with very good results.  Biggest was a C14 that was trashed from a school.  Took me awhile to get a new tube fabbed up but was really nice in the end.  Ended up losing it in a accident though.  I have thought about building one myself as the Obsession scope I want is a bit out of my price range now.  Anyway great job and stick with it.  I wish i had gotten into astronomy in my teens.  Currently stuck in a light polluted metro area so I have unfortunately fallen out of the hobby and sold off all of my equipment.
There’s so much here to be proud of! I must admit, when I reflect on my time as a 17 year old, I cannot recall a single accomplishment that comes close to this. Matter of fact, even at 33 years, I’m struggling to relate. Bravo dude, bravo!
That's an excellent piece of work and very professional-looking.

If you made the mirror I assume you used a machine rather than hand-grinding a disc that size.  Heard of those, but never seen them.  I do see the name of the telescope site here, though, and will have a look.

In any event, I'll bet you have fun with it.  Good.
Nerd! Nice job though. I really want a big scope myself but can't afford one. Cool to see you built your own!
Sir, the world needs people like you. Keep up the good work!
Wow this got to top fast, and it’s well deserving it’s position.
I have a baby boy, how can I raise him to grow up to be like you? Lol, but actually I really want to know... or were you just born a genius?
This is what you get done when u put your mind into it !!
Woah, 14.7" at f/2.89? How are the optics? It's always hard to get good quality for such a fast design. Looks great!
You are everything i aspired to be as a young kid but never had the ability to. Be proud of yourself and I truly hope other kids feel inspired by this! I also want to add that i don't want to emphasise on "kid" as this is extremely impressive no matter background or age.
Kudos! Under a dark sky, M42 must be jaw dropping in that.
The only way this gets better is if you worked part time and paid for all the parts yourself. 
Still bloody incredible regardless.
This is really awesome good for you man dont ever stop following your dreams you're a path people much older than you wish they were able to find at that age. Good Luck
Do I see  knowledge and experience of 50+ y/o scientists in a body and mind of a 17year old? Amazing!

I totally see you being top scientist and helper of the world in very close future!
How much did the 14.7” primary cost??  I made my own a while back using just a 6.4” because i found one that wasn’t that expensive, but much bigger than that it seemed prices rose pretty high pretty fast
Keep after it young man. You abilities and hard working nature will serve you well. 

I don't care how old you are. Life starts when it starts and you are well on your way.
How many K-Nex did it take? Oh shit, that thing's real.
Congratulations! What a badass accomplishment & a killer conversation starter for the rest of your life 🖤🖤
Amazing, you are an exceptional human keep doing what you love!
Imagine being invested in something so much and wanting something so much. Wow. I envy you, OP. Great job.
You're an absolutely insane kid dude, I love it!!
Don’t let anyone tell you that you are going to amount to nothing, or pull you down. You’re gonna achieve amazing things.
Half-naked girls get thousands of upvotes, how many for our boy in blue?

Back when we didn't realise how god-awful he was

I'd honestly rather spend a day with Elon than the most attractive female on Earth.
well. i'm female, so, *slips hands in pants*
*sigh*... unzips 

Edit: Don't tell me my most upvoted comment is about fapping to Elon Musk!

Edit 2: Yup, my most upvoted comment.  Thanks Reddit!! 
If Elon found and read these comments of him 5 years ago vs the comments now, he might consider buying Reddit
I like to think he did the "jerk-off motion" and this pic is right at the very end with his hand just opening up.
Honestly? Love some of his ideas and inventions but fuck him as a person. Like he’s seriously a trash person
Elon lookin' t h i c c

Elon musk is fundamentally different to Jeff Bezos /s
Dear god, 5 years ago I thought that guy was cool...
This Musk reach the top.
How the hell does this shit not get removed? This is literally the definition of circle jerk content. 
How many votes for when this boy in blue is harassing girls, hoping they're less than half naked?
The reputation Elon Musk had back then was drastically different to how it is now. For the better.
I love Mark Zuckerberg
He is an oddly shaped and proportioned individual.....

are we sure this whole scheme of his isn't just a ploy for him to "go back home"?
Is it me or he became chubby  ?

Edit. grammar 
Why would someone post a pic of Chaz Bono in this sub Reddit? 
#1 on all.
well that's elon musk for ya, reddit.
I thought this meme died. Is it back on Facebook again or something? Are all subs gonna be doing this again now?
None, but not because of him. His company sucks to be a supplier for
He has a doctor evil thing going on in this pic
Data.
I am seeing a rocket instead of a mouse arrow. anyone else?
musk has reached gates-esque levels of depravity

know it's super anti on reddit, but it's true
This in #1 on /r/all

And its not a votebaity post from /r/me_irl

Chaz Bono's transition has gone remarkably well. 
I think he's figured out that mars bars are more attainable than mars. 
Show some skin to win brah.. six pack helps get the upvotes.. maybe a nip slip
I hate that these kind of posts are a thing again
Is it just me or has the futurology king of kings been gaining weight?
I've never heard him speak, but I just imagine him having a weird accent. 

And I'm afraid to hear him speak and shatter that illusion for me.
I thought this was cielcjerk for a second. 
SHIT POST!
Never expected Elons reddit account to be kushloverxxl
Guys a billionaire, can't even iron his clothes. 
Really should hop on a treadmill. We need our best to live
ugh i hate this worship of a fucken bussinessman 

edit: jesus, ya'll are bunch of spineless suckers. I dont know how many times this needs to be said but bussinesses arent your god damn friend stop worshipping them at every turn
Honestly, Elon Musk is not a good guy. 
Isn't because they are amusing to watch after a hard tired work day.. it's like restaurant food.. we can't eat it daily but sometimes it's good..
"Who could have possibly taken the last cookie?"
Has he gained weight?
I wonder how many half-naked girls got wet looking at this picture
I think it's about time Elon Musk's publicists (who seem to own Reddit) just fucked off.  This guy makes a living sucking public subsidy (4.5 billion so far?).  Every fucking day I have to read more of his bullshit thoughts.  

Can someone write me an Elon Musk blocker?
I think this man will eventually be looked at and thought of with higher regard than Edison and Einstein. 
A truly revolutionary human .
Why this half-naked girl prolouge? Its annoying and upsetting.
awww chubby Elon
I love Elon Musk, but he's starting to look like Chaz Bono. 
Where's this half-naked girl with thousands of upvotes?
Seriously.There cant be zero upvotes for Musk. Wat is this bs, reddit?
I always wonder if Elon Musk got a team working for him that does nothing but write positive articles and post links to them on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit etc. 

He probably does, considering his wealth and how everything he is involved in is always surrounded by massive amounts of hype.

Can't blame him, I'd do the same if I was that rich.


WOW! HOT a What Baabhabhiat!
You think he could afford to pay someone to iron his shirt 
Is it me or does Elon look like he's transforming into a middle aged lesbian? Lol
This should have been a photoshop battle.
Glory to the blue corner
I give you an orange shaped rocket blasting you off to the top of the page! And once you reach it the orange shaped rocket will land itself :O
We did it Reddit!
I love the man, but come on
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Elon looks like a cross between John Favreau and the turtle from Bojack horseman
He might have the best hair transplant ever performed.
Zero apparently.
YES
Yawn.... let me know when he takes his shirt off.
Where is his neck?
Who dat.
First full-colour Image of deep space from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed by NASA (in 4k)

[**This web page**](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/038/01G7JGTH21B5GN9VCYAHBXKSD1) allows you to download the full resolution version of the image!
If you're interested as to what is causing the eight pointed stars, NASA released [this infographic](https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01G6933BG2JKATWE1MGT1TCPJ9.png) explaining the phenomenon.
Welcome to the Era of James Webb Space Telescope!
This is Hubble’s image of the same area

https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/smacs0723-73.jpg
All the different galaxies you can zoom in on... wow...
>This deep field, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours – achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields, which took weeks.

[https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet)
The oldest light being 13.5 BILLION years old. That is 300 million years after the Big Bang. Absolutely insane.
So apparently if you held a grain of sand at arm's length and then looked into the night sky, this is the patch of the universe that would be obstructed. 

Absolutely mindblowing, imagining each speck of light as a potential 100 million stars...
My brain cannot comprehend the scale of that photo. It just does the E+17 thing that Excel does when there are too many digits.
It's actually batshit insane if you zoom in all the way and realize every slightly browned pixel is an entire ancient galaxy.
I would be interested to hear an expert's analysis of what this image tells us. Did we expect to find such formed galaxies so far back in the past? Is this picture different from what we hypothesized it would be like?
I know no one is really going to see this but this is such a bittersweet thing for me.
 My younger brother worked on two different teams at Goddard to help bring it to life. Sadly, our father, who was huge into science, passed away just last week. He was always so proud of his kids no matter and this would have meant the world to him.
There's an Einstein Cross!! Just below the middle of the south-west arm of the largest ~~bright pointy~~ [diffraction-spiked](https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01G52A88BEZVK0040JWTSRQ1HC.png) star near the middle! [https://imgur.com/a/rAmATrQ](https://imgur.com/a/rAmATrQ)
Astronomer here!  This is SUCH a strange but wonderful day (at the start of a strange and wonderful week)- I have literally been hearing about JWST for the majority of my life, since I was a teenager first getting interested in astronomy, and to *see* that we are now truly in the JWST era is mind-boggling!  Not gonna lie, I think a cynical part of me thought something would go wrong and we wouldn't get here... and not only seeing the images, but having such immense pride for the humans who made this possible, is just so emotional. :)

To answer a few quick questions I've seen around:

**What is the image of?**

A galaxy field called [SMACS 0723](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet), located 4.6 billion light years away.  What's more, because of the orientation of the foreground galaxies we get to see some really zany gravitational lensing of light from galaxies much further away in this field- about 13 billion years, to be precise!  So these are all very young galaxies, all formed just a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.  Incredible!  And wow, never seen galaxies like those lensed ones before- very Salvador Dali, if I may say so. :D 

The ones that appear to have white light are the ones creating the lensing 5-ish billion light years away, and the reddish ones are the lensed ones.  (At least, I'm pretty sure that's how it works as a general rule of thumb.) [Here is Hubble's view of the same field](https://imgur.com/49beFKt) by comparison, courtesy of /u/NX1.

Also note, JWST is an infrared telescope (ie, light more red than red) because its first science priority was to detect the earliest galaxies (it's been under development so long exoplanets frankly weren't the huge thing they are now), and by the time the light from the earliest galaxies reaches us, it has been "redshifted" to these wavelengths.  So before you couldn't see these lensed galaxies with Hubble, and to see them let alone in such detail is *astounding*!

**Pretty!  Is there scientific value to it?**

Yes!  The thing to realize is even with these very first images, because JWST is able to see in detail no telescope has had before there's a ton of low hanging fruit.  In the case of this image, one of the big outstanding questions is a feature called the [UV luminosity function](http://www.na.astro.it/ACCESS/lf_uv.htm), which tells you the star formation rate in those early galaxies.  If you literally just count up the number of galaxies you see in those first JWST images, you'll already know more about the star formation rate in the early universe than we do now!  Further, when you study the gravitational lensing pattern, you can learn about those foreground galaxies- things like their mass, and how the dark matter is distributed around them.  OMG this is gonna be so neat!

**I need more JWST images in my life!  What's next?**

[There is a press conference tomorrow at 10:30am](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-updates-coverage-for-webb-telescope-s-first-images-reveal)!  At the press conference there will be several more images revealed, from the Carina Nebula to Stephan's Quintet (links go to the Hubble images to get you psyched).  There will also be some data revealed, such as the first exoplanet spectrum taken by JWST- note, exoplanet spectra *have* been done before scientifically, but the signal to noise of JWST allows this to be done to greater accuracy than before. (No, this is not going to have a signature from life- [it's a gas giant exoplanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-96b), and it's safe to say if it had a signature from life Biden would have revealed *that* today.)

**Pretty pictures aside, can I access the actual science data?  And when will we see the first JWST pictures?**

The JWST archive will be launched with all the commissioning data for these images on **Wednesday, July 13 at 11am EDT**, with the first Early Release Science programs' data going up on **Thursday**.  Specifically for the latter, there are "early release science" programs which are going to be prioritized over the first three months (list [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs)) where those data are going to be immediately available to the public, so everyone can get a jump start on some of the science. (Also, the next cycle of JWST proposals is in January, so this is going to be really crucial for people applying for that.) My understanding from my colleague is there are many people in the sub-field of early galaxies who literally have a paper draft ready to go and intend to get the preprints out ASAP (like, within hours), just because there will be so much low hanging fruit for that field in those very first images!  Like, I'll be shocked if they're not out by the end of the week, and the place to see those first science papers are on the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new) (updates at 0:00 UTC).

You can learn more about the JWST archive [here](https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2022/accessing-jwst-science-data-after-the-end-of-commissioning).

**How did they decide what to observe anyway?**

As is the case for all NASA telescopes, anyone in the world can apply for JWST time!  You just need to write a proposal justifying why *your* idea is better than anyone else's, and well enough that a panel of astronomers agrees.  In practice, it's really competitive, and about 4.5x more hours were requested than there are literal hours for JWST to observe (actually way better than Hubble which has been closer to 10x- Hubble can only observe on the night half of the Earth's orbit, but JWST has a sun shade so you get almost nonstop observing).  The resulting proposals that won out are all a part of "Cycle 1" which begins this week, and you can read all about them [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go). (Cycle 1 includes the Early Release Science projects I discussed above.)

As an aside, while I am not personally involved in it (I'm more on the radio astronomy side of things) I'm super excited because my group has JWST time!  We are going to observe what is likely to be the first [neutron star merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star_merger) observed by JWST- I very much hope to be able to look over the shoulder of the guy in charge of the project type thing. :) Because we have no idea on when that is going to happen, we basically have the right to request JWST observations if we see a signal called a short gamma-ray burst that tells us one of these events has occurred, and they'll change the schedule to squeeze us in as soon as they can (probably a week or two, with faster turn around in future years).  Whenever it happens, I'm sure I'll tell you guys all about it! :D

Anyway, a toast to JWST- and if anyone who works on it is reading this, we are all so proud of you!  I can't wait to see where this new adventure takes us!

Edit: y'all are too kind!  But to answer two common questions:

1) I refer to these galaxies as "young" despite being 13 billion light years away from us because we see these galaxies *as they appeared 13 billion years ago*, when the universe was very young.  So when we look at the furthest away things in the universe we are actually seeing the youngest galaxies we've ever seen!  Space is wild!

2) The lensing appears to be centralized because that is the center of mass of the galaxy cluster.  Remember, most of the mass is *not* in those white galaxies, but instead in the [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) we cannot directly see (but whose effects we can see thanks to this lensing).  Space is *really* wild!
Gravitational lensing looks absolutely gorgeous
Compared to the 107 billion people who have ever lived on earth, we're quite lucky to be among the 7.2 percent group who are alive to witness this today!
This is just the presidential preview image. NASA is doing a press conference tomorrow presenting the full series of images.
As a teenager, living out in the countryside, late at night, walking home after having some drinks with friends, I used to stop, look up and feel small. Countless times I stopped and admired life and the universe. After all those years, I have this feeling again. This is next level, I got goosebumps, not even exaggerating.
who changed this already as their computer and phone wallpaper, i know i did 😂
The gravitational lensing is gorgeous. I'm so blown away. This is looking back 13 *billion years* **into the past**. We are literally looking at the first moments of our Universe. It's wild how our world works. Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.

*Edit: The closest galaxies in this image are 4.6 billion and the furthest ones (lensed and red) are from 13 billion years into the past*
I love the way light bends around !!
The microscope reveals to man his significance; the telescope, his insignificance - Manly P. Hall
I've loved space all of my life, I'm not an expert or anything, but seeing this picture has been a definitive moment in my life.

This is what we need to focus on as a species, not wars and politics. This is the best thing I have ever seen.
Such an amazing day. I felt emotional looking at this image.

Be kind to everyone. Take care of this planet.
This is just beautiful.
This incredible human achievement can now be the background of your phone until you get tired of it.
just think how many civilisations may have came and gone in that image billions of years before the light even arrived to the JWST lenses , its astonishing to think every blemish in that image is an entire galaxy like ours with billions of stars like ours with potential stories like we have here on earth … fuck, your soulmate may be among that image somewhere, an almost exact copy of you, a planet occupied by cute koalas who wear suits and ties and shit , entire galactic wars may be currently being fought somewhere in that image…. FUCK
Just think of how much potential life we may be looking at in this picture
Not me trying to understand gravitational lensing and having to google “what is light”
you win the karma race, this image is a lot higher res than the others everyone is posting. Where did you find it?
It took less than a day for JWST to capture this photo, Hubble takes weeks to do the same.
Wait. They were able to capture this in just 12.5 hours!!!???

Lateralus by TOOL just happened to come up on my Spotify shuffle as I was looking at this.

Spiral out, keep going.
Are those all "real" colours you'd see with your eyes or is it data processing?
So much out there...and we're held back by stupid people squabbling and small minded people who crave power...fuckin sad.
Here's my quick and dirty comparison of JWST vs HST using this image: https://i.imgur.com/6KD7d1d.jpg

*Edit*: And here's a fuller version: https://i.imgur.com/mFboRT6.jpg
So is this technically the oldest image in existence?
> This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground.

Holy moley

https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages
This is the deepest image of a galaxy that we have ever taken a photo of! We are seeing some of the galaxies in the image as they existed 13 billion years ago!! We are seeing the first galaxies that formed in the first billion years of the universe's existence.

For comparison, the hubble deep field images were able to see galaxies around 12 billion light years away; 1 billion year difference!!

EDIT: Text descriptions of image taken from the [Webb Telescope's website](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/038/01G7JGTH21B5GN9VCYAHBXKSD1)

>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. Known as Webb’s First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.

&#x200B;

>In front of the galaxies are several foreground stars. Most appear blue with diffraction spikes, forming eight-pointed star shapes. Some look as large as the galaxies that appear next to them.  
>  
>A very bright star is slightly off center. It has eight blue, long diffraction spikes. In the center of the image, between 4 o’clock and 6 o’clock in the bright star’s spikes, are several bright, white galaxies. These are members of the galaxy cluster.  
>  
>There are also many thin, long, orange arcs. They follow invisible concentric circles that curve around the center of the image. These are images of background galaxies that have been stretched and distorted by the foreground galaxy cluster
How many people or "beings" are alive behind this photo? Makes me curious. Has to be something out there.
Don't forget the mind blowing part here.  From the NASA website..."This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground."

I don't know what I'm looking at, but it is beautiful!
It's beautiful, the lensing is so incredible to look at! So exciting, what a great day, I can't wait to find out what astronomers can learn from this.
QUESTION:

Are there any galaxies in this field of vision beyond that of the furthest and feintest galaxies in this image? In other words, is this pretty much all there is when you look at this part of the sky, or are there galaxies and stars so much further away that the light can't reach the telescope?
Incredible. It's also incredible to think we'll look back on this image in 30 years and say this one is low-res compared to whatever will come next.
Not the topless aliens I was hoping for but I've got my fingers crossed for tomorrow.
Crazy to think how much life we are potentially looking at
Imagine the Milky Way showing up as a tiny spec on one of these guys’ telescope. They would probably gloss over us just as quickly as we jump around the image looking at a new tiny smudge. It’s impossible to fully appreciate each smudge as quite possibly home to thousands of civilizations like our own.
makes me sad that we'll never visit or even be able to communicate with beings in those galaxies (barring something that invalidates the laws of physics)
My problems are so insignificant compared to all this....
All this in the space of a grain of sand held at arms length  The universe is unfathomably massive
"Space is big, really big"

Gravitational lensing at work, this is beyond awe inspiring
I’m absolutely loving the spiral galaxy in the top right. Incredible image, can’t wait to see what’s next!
After finishing work at 23:58. Seeing this was aan awesome birthday gift in the taxi home!
I can't look at this and ever believe we're alone.
This picture is the equivalent of a grain of sand held at arms length in the night sky. 
Every one of those specks is a galaxy. Each of those has billions of stars in them. Some of them have planets. No matter how hard we try or how advanced we get we will never even come close to stepping foot on one of those planets. Maybe one has a civilization on them. Maybe they’re looking as us too. 
Space is fucking terrifying
There's no way there's no life in this picture.
During the stream, they stated that the cross-section of space that this is equivalent to is the amount that's covered by a grain of sand resting on your finger with your arm fully extended. The galaxies seen here are about 13 billion lightyears away

Webb has way more detail, but you can spot where it compares.
It's feels underwhelming at first. Because, after all, it just feels like the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. But this image requires repeated encounters. To understand and appreciate the span and magnitude of what is being seen. And to the sheer numerical intensity of galaxies in the frame, the level of detail, and what really drives the point home is the massive amount of gravitational lensing that's occuring in the foreground, relative *to* the background, *without* an explicit designation of *what* is causing it. Yes, obviously, there's a massive mass between the observer and the background galaxies, but where's the central locus that is bending space at such a huge scale and why can't we see it?

And the answer to that question is more than likely dark matter. The benefit these observations will have towards answering that question will be immensely valuable. Why? Because we're going to devise new models of physics or new branches or sub branches to understand what we're seeing. That's going to force the development of new hardware and software to parse, analyze, and understand it. Those innovations will lead to new discoveries in supporting fields across the board, and they'll in turn have massive feedback loops for the world.

A lot of people always ask the question "isn't there other stuff we could better spend money on than this? It's not impressive." But these people don't understand that, to get this image, they had to create new hardware and software and instrumentation that has never existed on this planet before. That hardware and software will eventually make it's way into commercial space where it improves cameras of all kinds, with new cooling techniques and new ways to collect and store light. There'll be new algorithms entering the market for image processing, which has huge impacts for potential computer vision projects and eventual AI. All this is supported by hundreds of thousands of engineers and software developers and material scientists.

So no, there's no better way to spend money than trying to figure out our place in the universe. The more we look deeper into the past, the **harder the problem becomes.** Which requires you to spend a ton of money and time to solve it. Which leads to tons of ancillary discoveries. Those create breeding grounds for new ideas. New ideas unrelated to space, and more related to problems at home. Problems that now have solutions *only because* we decided to look at the sky and say "what I see isn't good enough, I want to see further and better and I want it now."
This may be a dumb question, but what are the very bright spots that are flared? Why are they so much brighter than the rest of the galaxies we can see and make out in this image?
The distance between everything in this imagine is mind breaking.
What's crazy about this picture is that they all look so close....yet are millions, billions of light years away from eachother
Looks like what I see when I stand up really fast
For the people who made this possible...

 I hope there is a world, perhaps in this image.

A world where people like you are celebrated.  You are the beacon of humanity.
What a breathtaking experience to see this image. Sharing this sense of wonder with millions of people around the world is the closest I can feel, as an atheist and materialist, a spiritual sense of connectedness with everyone on this planet, a deep love for all and gratitude for all matter in the universe. 

This telescope cost $10 billion dollars.

Every year, with the money it spends on war, the US could afford to launch 70 of these telescopes, or similarly astounding technologies for scientific discovery. 

Every year it could afford to launch 10, and still have enough money to run the most powerful military in the world. 

Moments like this are an opportunity for us to consider the messed up priorities of those that make decisions on our behalf.
I took nearly 50,000 images of the night sky to make an 81 Megapixel image of Tuesday's moon. Uncompressed image linked in the comments. [OC]

This is definitely one of the best photos I have seen of the moon. Well done !
I know it's a silly comment, but you really get the sense of depth in this picture. It's so crisp and with the earthshine you really perceive a sphere and not just a circle. Beautiful work!
**Zoom in**

&#x200B;

This image was created using a combination of shots from 2 different cameras, one to capture earthshine and stars, and one to capture the detail on the lit side of the moon. The shots were then stacked and pieced together for editing. I took so many shots to average out the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence, as well as to eliminate noise captured by the camera sensor. A note to astrophotography purists: I did take some creative liberties with the composition to make up for areas with bad or incomplete data, so I would define this image as more of a composite than a true photograph. [For more of this kind of thing- come find me on instagram @cosmic\_background.](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic_background/) Feel free to DM me if you ever want to chat about astronomy/astrophotography or anything else. All my shots are taken from my backyard in Sacramento, California.

Feel free to swipe this as a wallpaper. Because of the high resolution and square image, it can be cropped to fit any device and still look good, but unfortunately reddit required me to downscale the jpg quality to get it under 20MB to post, so this still isn't it's highest quality.

&#x200B;

If this looks familiar- I posted an earlier iteration of the image to r/spaceporn and r/pics on Wednesday. I have since completely reprocessed the image to eliminate the background noise I atttempted to pass off as stars (it looked fine up close- but it still bugged me because you could tell it was a noise pattern).

The moon was captured in "tiles", so I'd point the camera at it and take a bunch of pictures of just one portion of it, and then reposition, and do it again.Just the lit side of the moon is 25 "tiles", each tile the best 50% of 2000 images stacked.  I'd stack each tile separately to average out the noise from the sensor, sharpen it to get rid of the blurring caused by the atmosphere, and then combined them in photoshop to create the final image.

Beautiful picture! I look forward to seeing the high-res version!
That's just amazing... it just hit me that I've never seen a photo of the moon quite like this, and you did it from Earth!

How long did it take to take all those photos?

And I don't suppose you could share a handful of the 50,000 shots, I'm really curious what you were working with to put this together!
Nice attempt, but you fucked up on the lighting. Only half of it’s lit!

The poor moon. It took all those hits for us, and we cant even be bothered to go and visit it anymore. Where is that space force we were promised? 
Don't see a link for the uncompressed. But seems clicking on it wants to load it but taking forever. 
You should go to the moon and do the same thing for Earth.
This is perhaps the best picture I have ever seen. Amazing job!

Yo, NASA just used your image in their Artemis 1: We are capable video.. your image must've been so good that a literal space program used it for like 3 seconds
This made me go outside to take another look myself. Never been particularly fussed about photography, but I'd say that's a pretty special reaction. Thanks OP
This is one of the most incredible images I've ever seen. Thank you so much for sharing ❤️ I appreciate you offering us to enjoy as wallpaper, and I will totally take you up on that! 

Is there a way I can purchase a print from you? 
Take all the karma on earth. And on the moon.  Very well done. Could you please explain the process? What camera, lens, gigs pixel device. etc..  thanks again. 
Is the high res one 18mb? I went to the link and google only downloads a file that size
This is hands down the best photo of the moon I’ve ever seen. You’re extremely talented at what you do, would love to see more! 
Damn thats the best photo ive ever seen of the moon. When i zoomed in, i suddenly smiled and got happy to be alive to see it. Thanks OP
How do you physically complete the daunting task of taking 50,000 photos.
Just to let you know some random guy on the internet has your amazing pic as his background on his phone. 
You can see exactly where they faked the moon landing! 
Please create a new link to the 291MB version of the image, google photos says too many people have previewed/downloaded it so there is no longer access to it.
I took the liberty of editing this and posting it on /r/Amoledbackgrounds, hope you don't mind. Awesome image.

Just wanted to comment and say THANK YOU so much for making this and sharing it with us! I really like having my desktop and cell phone match one another, but I hadn't found one I liked until now. I've gone ahead and sized this down to 9:16 for my phone and 3:2 for my laptop, and this photo makes them both look so great! 

If I used Instagram, you'd have another sub (not that it means a lot).

Best!
Incredible photo! I tweaked it so I could use it as my phone's wallpaper:

This one post got you roughly 5 years of reddit premium
At this level of detail it almost doesn't look real! INCREDIBLE WORK! thank you for sharing ;)
My new wallpaper! This is absolutely insane. Amazing.
That is awesome I'm the true sense of the word. The detail when zooming in is astonishing. Very well done, thank you for sharing 🌠
This is badass. But I have a legitimate question because I really don't know. Can you see the American flag they out on the moon from a photo like this? Given the right conditions of course. 
Fantastic photo. Unfortunately, all the uncompressed links appear to have been hugged to death.

Would anyone who got a copy be willing to start a torrent? 

Seems like a great use for torrents.

How the hell am I supposed to find the uncompressed image in all this 😩
Amazing - I have HDR'd the shot to make it easier to see the underbelly...  Hope that is OK.  [https://imgur.com/CMsiQzB](https://imgur.com/CMsiQzB)
How come that guy takes better pictures than NASA? It’s the most beautiful picture of the moon I have ever seen!
“That’s no moon, ...... ..... it’s a space station”
It's crazy how detailed this is! You can even tell it's an oblate spheroid!
Wow I set this as my lock screen wallpaper on perspective mode and when it loads up it looks amazing.

Great picture and thank you
how much storage space did you use for all those images? i’ve heard of people using a few terabytes for an hour of 4k video
Im still having trouble seeing the alien moon bases and that glass tower they have been talking about since the 70’s.
/u/ajamesmccarthy, could you rehost the same file on google drive one more time? This composition is awesome and google probably won't open up the download option again for another 24 hours.
not that you have any control over it... but this is going to be my new background image"s" :D
Incredible photo - my jaw hit the floor.  Please take more.
How much y’all wanna bet that this is his phone wallpaper
It’s amazing how gravity can keep both the Earth and the Moon together at such a distance.  There’s more to gravity than we know (at least today). 
Wow this is so amazing! I've had to study the moon and other astronomical objects for my course so to be able to see the moon like this is genuinely moving. Keep up this amazing work!

&#x200B;
Your pic got posted on Instagram by an astronomy account with no credit to you
You might have accidentally caught the ISS... [https://i.ibb.co/vLJQgRK/Annotation-2019-02-17-200500.png](https://i.ibb.co/vLJQgRK/Annotation-2019-02-17-200500.png)
I was curious about scale, so I loaded up the moon in Google Earth and measured the distance between those two big craters.

https://imgur.com/a/WzfYL5k

1650km!
I would be happy to support you and pay you for a high res print on fantastic paper. You should set up a store on squarespace ASAP.

Also I can't find the link image
I don't think I like the glow effect in the space around the bright side. Why was that added?
That is awesome, in a definition-based sense. 

This is amazing! Thank you!
I love this so much I made it my phone wallpaper.
What? Why does every comment have zero points? Anyway, sick image!
This is one repost I'd be ok with seeing everyday for the rest of my life. Incredible work dude. Seriously incredible.
This is absolutely stunning. Thank you for doing this!
I wouldn't have known this was an actual picture if you hadn't said anything. Amazing shot!
Truly stunning and absolutely amazing! Do you mind if I make this a wallpaper?
I always thought photos of the moon were rather boring - it's been done. Millions of times. I stand corrected. This is fantastic. I can't imagine the amount of time this would have taken.
Welp. After 3 years I now have a new background. Thanks for this OP, it’s stellar!
Wow, that’s absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for the work and sharing it.
Amazing. I don't even have words to describe it. I've always loved the moon, and this is just the perfect gift someone could give to me. Thank you so much!
What cameras did you use, and any speciality equipment?
I've never seen the moon lit from the top before
I don’t know how you keep doing it, but please never stop taking such amazing photos and giving us such a unique view of something we perhaps take for granted for the fact that it’s always there. I love this!
That is hands down the best photo of the moon I have ever seen!!!! Massive well done
I just wowed. Like I never wow at photos. It’s the internet it’s full of them but this daaaaaaammmmnn. 
Wow. This is like HD porn where you can see the girl's pores. 
This is humblingly beautiful. You gave us something our own eyes never could. Thank you.
I’m over the moon with this picture. It’s absolutely stellar..... 
Wow... It's wonderful! I'm speechless!

Congratulations! I'm 42 and this is the most beautiful picture of the moon that I've ever seen! 
This is incredible! Thank you so much for sharing this with everyone!
Not to detract from your effort to capture the moon - it is great and all, but has anyone else noticed that triangular craft in the distance?
Did you have to correct for the rotation of earth?
Can someone photoshop the Majora’s Mask moon into this? 
Is the surrounding glow due to the moon's atmosphere, minimal that it is?
With your permission, I'd like to make this into a poster for myself (not to sell or share).
what program did you use to create this stack?! its damn impressive
Full screen, zoom just crashed my reddit app.. D:
Mesmerizing photo!..
This is just amazingly done, holy shit.  I can barely even wrap my brain around your workflow since I just play around on an extremely old copy of registax and stack 30 second video clips.  May I ask what stacking apps you used for this image?  I gotta get back out there on my telescope, gawd damn.
Absolutely stunning!  Amazing work OP.  The moon looks like it’s suspended there - a perspective I’ve never seen before.  This has to be the single greatest photo of the moon I’ve ever seen.
You cannot get enough upvotes for this. Absolutely stunning.
This has got to be the best photo of Yue, Sokka would be impressed
Serious question. I shoot photos. How the hell do you deal with/even take 50k photos? 
I can’t find the uncompressed image link in the comment sea!!!
Thank you. New phone background. Much better than default Apple crap
I fucking love the moon. Just look at it, just hanging out, reminding us we are in space. 
You’re giving a high res version away for free?  Thank you.  Also, hope you kept the best for yourself, cause that’s probably the coolest shot(s) of the moon I’ve ever seen, and you better be licensing that kinda talent
and chance we can get the 291MB version added somewhere for DL?
Thanks for the new phone wallpaper. Sweet pic. 
The link died again. Anyone have a link?
This might be a dumb question but I don’t understand. Did you take 50,000 images and somehow combine them to make this photo? How did you “make” the 81 megapixel image? It’s really awesome btw!
See this is why we need to take photographers like this guy on future space missions. 

NASA takes a crap ton of pictures that the public never cares about or doesn’t believe cause they are not so well represented like in this picture.
I just set this as my new wallpaper on my phone. Thanks!
That is such a cool picture. Zooming in and seeing all the craters is awesome!!!
Hey would you be able to do the same thing but with Saturn or Mars?  I'd buy a print for sure if they look as good as this.
Thank you for my phones new background. This is amazing. 
[deleted]
Is this the greatest photo of the moon in all of history??
I know this might be a strange question but what is the scale? Like I know those craters are big,but like how many football fields is the center-leftish  crater?
Your photo looks so real that it looks fake. Well done!!!
What’s that purple streak/cluster at about 2 o’clock next to the edge?
Congratulations, you just took one of the greatest pictures of the moon in human history.
Somehow this image really reveals how the moon just hangs there. How it just floats in space, bound by nothing else but our planet's orbit. Amazing, absolutely amazing picture of the moon.
[this isn’t the exact one but just tell me this doesn’t all look simulated](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2iSZMv64wuU) 
I am taking 35-40 minutes to download the 290MB file. Yes my internet sucks that much, but damn will it be cool to look at.

Edit: I was right. Cool as fuck. Worth it.
This makes me wonder what our earth would look like from the moon using the same method to take the photo. Astonishing, by the way.
Congrats, you ve just made my new wallpaper. Really impressive!
I know this will get lost, and there’s already so many amazing comments but this is stunningly beautiful. 
Can someone ELI5 how 50,000 pics makes one really nice pic?
It’s fucking spectacular you can see the crevices.
This is probably the best photo of the moon I’ve ever seen.  Absolutely stunning and captures all its beauty.  Bravo.
I would love to print this on a large photograph. Where could I get a hi-res of the original please?
By complete accident I captured a plane crossing in front of our sun. I was able to figure out exactly which flight it was and got connected with the pilot, who was thrilled.

That would make an excellent logo, or album cover.
The clip is stunning. The contrail effect you described looks as if the jet is causing solar flares on each side of the sun.
When you take pictures as often as I do, the likelihood of happy accidents increases. Like this plane interrupting my shot of our sun two weeks ago. Completely unplanned, yet it added something to the image that made it uniquely beautiful. After I posted the image to my IG a couple weeks ago, someone messaged me with the flight number (they were able to pin it down based on a guess of my address and the time of the capture) and reached out to the pilot, since they worked for the airline. 

[Take a look at the video of the transit](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKMf2DfpZ6D/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and notice how the plane is only visible when covering the sun, but the contrails are easily visible regardless. This is due to the contrails scattering the sun’s hydrogen alpha light, which my scope is sensitive to. It creates the illusion of a vanishing plane! This was done with a specially designed telescope, never try this with an ordinary one.

I have been capturing the sun for years, and taken thousands of batches of frames, each of which are thousands of images recorded like video, and never captured a plane like this before, so this is literally 1-in-a-million! To learn more about my astrophotography journey- check out my twitter (same as reddit username) or [my instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic_background/)
I’m curious, how’d you figure out what flight it was?
A little sus that you referred to it as "our" sun. Are you sure you're not an alien trying a little too hard to fit in? 🤔
It looks like that plane is going super sayain 4
You should have watermarked this because now someone is going to steal it and use it for their CD cover
Looks like the flag for Greendale Community College
How did you determine the flight number and get ahold of the pilot?

I have a similar pic that occurred during the last transit of mercury. It's not as high quality as yours, but i would imagine the pilot would be equally happy. 

[my lucky catch](https://i.imgur.com/vGL3N5q.jpg)
Truly excellent work, deliberately accidental shots are THE BEST!!!!!!
Truly amazing shot... are you sure that isn’t the GME rocket going to the moon though? 
💎✋🚀
Wtf kind of camera do you have?? I can see the fcking gas and flames around the sun
Wait till you zoom in to see all the details! Mindblowing.
Good news! The IVF was a success. The bad news is that there's been a mix up and you'll be giving brith to a jumbo jet.
You should submit this to Nat Geo’s picture of the year contest.
I love it. The fact that you when outta your way to get the pic to the pilot makes this picture even better.
One of the happiest little accidents I've ever seen!
Pilot: "To our left, we have our Sun looking orangey as ever. And our right is Mercury..."
Why does the sun look like that? What kind of camera do you use?
I seriously don't understand how a kid calls an airport and asks to talk to a pilot over having caught the plane in a photograph and the airline doesn't just hang up on the kid.
My god!!! If I was the pilot I can totally see the emotion in that pic! If was the photographer I can totally see emotion in that pic! I was a passenger or a resident of the town that was over I can totally see the emotion in that pic! Incredible picture!!!!!!!!!!!
Howdy, other carbon-based mammals! Please focus your attention on this photographic representation of our local mass of burning helium and hydrogen for enjoyment.
How did you manage to get in contact with that exact pilot from a photo like this?
I’m never gonna understand how photos like these are possible. I know they are, just can’t comprehend it.
How in the world do you even find the flight number?
Saw this on r/misleading thumbnails. They said it was a butthole.
“Hello, Airport? Did any of your planes fly between the earth and the sun today? I need to know the name of the man behind the wheel. Thanks.”
Where was the pic taken ? Where was the plane going?

Beautiful pic, thanks to the OP
That’s so cool to see the sun as it probably looks. It’s so bright and obviously we can’t stare at it, real cool image man.
I dont understand how this is possible? Is the photo heavily modified? what happens there?
I was confused about why you specified "our sun" until I saw the sub
I feel like getting in contact with that pilot is cooler than the picture, and the picture is awesome!
How did you manage to trace the flight and the pilot?
I want to hear what the pilot said! r/mademesmile
You can't fool me! Clearly, this is a plane egg.
It's ridiculous how much I want to know which flight it was.  I mean, why do I care?  It's just one of 10s of thousand of planes that were flying that day, but I wanna know where they were coming from and where they were going.   I always ponder this question whenever I see a plane fly overhead a 35,000ft.
Didn't you already share this a few months ago? It's still cool AF just wondering....
Was worried you caught a plane crossing someone elses sun!
Are you impregnating the nation of Japan with a plane?
I think it's also incredible that you found the flight number of this aircraft.
Excellent sleuthing. You should check out r/picturegame
The Sun is so godly. . I think I’ll worship it.
Commence golden girls theme song: 

THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND!
You managed to find the pilot? Surrrrre you did.
Pilot is holding GME, and he’s off to the moon.
I remember this video. So happy to hear that you found the pilot.
This is one of those pictures that you see for years shared all across the internet. Well done.
This got posted to a Pilot Wife Facebook group, one of the ladies is the wife of the pilot! Was super cool seeing it posted there, and finding it again here! Great photo u/ajamesmccarthy
[deleted]
This looks like a logo for a Japanese airline.
Congratulations on winning the internet today.
This is just the Greendale flag.

*E pluribus anus*
Just curious, how did you find out who the pilot was? Did you like straight up call the airline?
You are a wonderful human being for taking the effort to find the pilot! :) <3
This picture beautifully exentuates the fact that our sun is a massive flaming giant. The detail.
I'm here because it thought it was a butthole.
“Our sun”  I wanna know what planet this sun belongs to, cause I ain’t never seen Earth’s sun looking like that 😂😂😂
This would be an amazing logo for a space travel/plane company
What a wonderful inter personal moment you had.
This is perfect for a vaperwave album cover. 


It's a great photo and happy to hear you got in contact with the pilot
Hey, I sifted through some of the comments and couldn’t find if you had posted about your camera settings and what lens/filter you used? 

When we had the eclipse a few years ago I had the chance of capturing it on video for a documentary. We ordered a solar filter and had to stack additional filters to get around 32 stops to shoot into the sun but our sun looked blue. Probably an effect of mixing the the filters we had.
has to be picture of the year. and the year just begun
Makes me think of the album cover art for Heatmiser’s, Mic City Suns. This is so much better, though. Beautiful picture!
Happy accident. Looks like a good composition.
This is a common argument in the photography world with editing. Does the same picture have value if you just photo shop the plane in?
how on earth did you do the math to figure out what flight it was?
I’m so happy this was you!!!! I’ve been a HUGE fan of your moon pics... although even calling them a pic... simply does not do their magnificence justice! THIS is an amazing (and LUCKY) shot!!
Incredible shot. I’ve got nothing incredible to add; just contributing to the count of fans. :)
Wow that’s some r/nextfuckinglevel stuff right there.
Astounding doesn't even begin to describe how magical this is. You deserve every accolade.
Photo was *way" higher def than I was expecting
This looks like the flag from greendale community college. E plurabus anus
What is so cool about this picture, to me, is that it gives some frame of reference to get a feel of the sun's actual size. I say "a feel", because not knowing the plane's distance and the focal length, and without doing serious calculations, it doesn't give any precise information. But precise is, precisely, not what I'm after here. To our bare eyes, the sun is just a spot in the sky, and the fact it is so bright make it hard to give it a size. We have all seen close-up shots of the surface as well, but never had I seen it with an element of context like that. To see it *that* big, behind a 100ft aircraft, when it is 150.000.000 Km away... (400x earth-moon distance.., almost 4000x earth circumferences), makes me realize, feel in my gut, for the first time, just how gigantic the sun is compared to us.
Couldn't get a shot in front of KY Cygni, huh? Just saying. Maybe try harder next time.
Almost looks like poster with a plane in front of a giant corona virus, claiming that flying into holidays spreads the virus and kills people.

stay home.
Fantastic shot!
Would you mind if I asked your capture setup/settings?
What an awesome picture! I'm seriously stunned.

Can you tell us a little more about your setup? I assume you are using a hydrogen-alpha filter? I have looked up some on the internet, but couldn't find a suitable one? What did you use and how did you mount it?

Thank you :)
The way you said “our sun” made me think this is some other planets sun
I know it’s been filtered, but the Sun looks gorgeous in this picture. Would be amazing if we actually had a giant grapefruit in the sky.
If you zoom in really close on the sun, it looks like a dodgeball!
Your sun is beautiful, I wish we had one like that.
Hiw did you figure out the flight and get connected to the pilot?! Amazing capture, stunning, stellar, should be preserved for all time levels of cool
It’s probably already been said but you shouldn’t put photography like this on the internet without a watermark.
I saw this photo in the corner of my eye and thought is was the SpaceX logo 😆
[removed]
This is gonna get blown up into a huge photo and hung in that pilots living room wall, 100%.
This is what i CME here for. Ah hah... ha... I'll see myself out...
the fact we can get shots like this AND find the flight/plane

&#x200B;

but we cannot get a clear, stunning photo of the person committing a crime at a gas station and takes us days or months to find them
Is no one going to ask how he found of which plane it was and the number of the pilot
That seems like a scam way to sell photos. 


1 )Take pretty pic of plane.
2) call every pilot of that type of plane in the world and claim this was taken on their last trip. 
3) profit !!
Unreal photo. Fucking amazing 2021 level photography
My favorite part a out reading that is you using the possessive "our sun". Like yea, i figured which sun, but it is nice you were speicific.
This is amazing! It's now my phone background!
The planochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
Damn awesome shot. Next destination: to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
> our sun

Sounds like something an extra terrestrial would say
I really love this shot, and the video might be even cooler. Thanks for posting this!
Very cool that you reached out to the pilot! Nicely captured moment in time!
This is an amazing shot, and not to down play it, but more so as a bonus, this is an epic mobile wallpaper
That's very cool of you to see it through to contacting the pilot.

\*golf clap*
I can't believe you can make out surface features on a shot with, like, just terrestrial zoom.  Crazy friggen shot, man.
What a sweetheart you are, for taking the trouble to find the flight and pilot. Bless your heart. Also a very cool picture.
Just before people decide to get their own shots of this they should know that they need a special lens if they want to look at the sun trough telescope. Because you will burn your eyes otherwise.
Daaaaaang! I think this is the universe thanking you for taking all these incredible images and sharing them. One of the coolest images I’ve ever seen, keep up the amazing work 👍
Looks like it's nosing its way through the zona pellucida.
I'm thrilled for the pilot. I bet this is placed somewhere prominent. Like his phone background or something.
Look the hole it made as it flew into the sun! That thing was UUUGE!


/s
This might be the neatest picture I've ever seen. Great shot!
The pilot probably thought.

"That's some advanced level stalking"
If I was the pilot I would get that shit framed in a heartbeat
This reminds me of a Placebo album cover  https://i.imgur.com/6mkRTDL.jpg
That's just GME blasting off for tomorrow. 

Current destination: The Moon
🚀🚀🚀
What allows a camera to take a picture of the sun?  Does it auto focus?  Can the photographer look at the image to make sure it's in the right position?

Obviously this is how it works?  Just curious on the science or whatever
Sadly not hard to find that info out.

As a software engineer and avid DefCon viewer not only is it easy to figure out, it's easy to spoof flights.  Like you could spend $100 and make it look like 10 f-22's were approaching the white house with very little effort
The detail on the sun is outstanding... I had no clue there was a camera capable of that! Plus having it so in focus along with a sharp outline of the plane, that is nuts.
Any advice for someone who wants to photograph the sun? Like equipments or something?
Man I bet that pilot was so hyped to see this picture! What a gorgeous and interesting photo
Great logo for a retro tv series of ✈️ in the 60’s a la Queen’s Gambit but way better than Panam.
I’m curious, how were you able to track down the pilot?
Awesome awesome awesome. I don't have anything else to add.
One day this will be the only way there could be a total eclipse since the earth and moon are slowly moving further from each other.
This picture is great. That video is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
I saw a solar flare when the plane left from the sun in the video that was cool
This might just be my new favorite photo. Stunning!!
How were you able to find out the flight and get a hold of pilot?  Awesome pic btw!
“Our sun”. Hmm sounds like something an alien would say. Ok fellow “human”. 

Great pic tho.
As a pilot I would also be thrilled


We don’t get many photos of us that aren’t in the jet
Really cool that you connected with the pilot. What an awesome perspective to see yourself in.
Looks like the Non-stop from Krypton to the Shadowzone.
This seems like the kind of shot that wins major awards.
nokia phone cameras never cease to amaze me

nice shot op
This is a stunning image ... and more kudos for your detective skills.  Compliments from a random person on the internet.

Edit:  I especially love the loss of resolution from the exhaust.  Changes in density are a helluva drug.
[deleted]
Your photo makes the sun look like the spiciest kickball.
How big are the solar flares compared to the earth?
Fantastic shot!
Also... “our sun” is totally something an alien who is trying to blend in would say. Welcome to Terra fellow traveler!
One of the most uniquely beautiful and stunning things ive ever seen
I just love that you found the pilot! So neat!
How the hell were you able to figure out which flight it was exactly?
Aww crap, it's a red dwarf now? I didn't know, there were clouds in the way!
Thank you for saying “by accident” and not “on accident”.
The clearest image of Mars ever taken!

Dang if you zoom in, you can see the individual craters, awesome picture
What is that long scar around the midsection of the planet?
Source: [https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6453/valles-marineris-hemisphere-enhanced/](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6453/valles-marineris-hemisphere-enhanced/)

>Mosaic of the Valles Marineris hemisphere of Mars projected into point  perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a  spacecraft. The distance is 2500 kilometers from the surface of the  planet, with the scale being .6km/pixel. The mosaic is composed of 102  Viking Orbiter images of Mars. The center of the scene (lat -8, long 78)  shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2000 kilometers  long and up to 8 kilometers deep, extending form Noctis Labyrinthus, the  arcuate system of graben to the west, to the chaotic terrain to the  east. Many huge ancient river channels begin from the chaotic terrain  from north-central canyons and run north. The three Tharsis volcanoes  (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers high, are visible to the  west. South of Valles Marineris is very ancient terrain covered by many  impact craters.
Those 2...3? Impact craters on the left are they fresh? Is that why they're a darker brown color?

Edit: They're volcano's. Thank you.
It reminds me a picture of earth without water. Mars looks like our home.

Earth without oceans: https://imgur.com/zeumHdt
Based on this, we need an image of what Mars would look like with oceans and flora. 

And based on that, I bet we could create a general map of where the cities would have sprung up if they mirrored our development.

This photo is so exquisite I am using it as my phone wallpaper now! 😍
That's beautiful! How many images is this a composite of?

Also, sort of looks like a very tired "me gusta" Rage comic face.. as if it retired in 2012..
It’s amazing how quickly we are advancing. Just think how far we’ll go in 20 years.
*looks at Mars* 
yeah we can terraform that no problem!

*Looks at Earth* 
ahh.. I don't think she's gonna make it, it's too far gone!
Now I want to see an image of Earth without water

If you look closely, you can see the cylinder launching facilities, tripod manufacturing plants, and red weed farms.

I find it super fascinating that I almost scrolled past this image. It took me a second to realise that it's *incredible* that we have so clear images of *another* planet. People wouldn't believe it just mere 50 years ago, and yet imagine 500 years ago at Copernicus' age. 

But to me, for a second, it was "just another photo of Mars".
I beg to differ . There is a whole documentary about an astronaut being stranded on mars in hd quality
**Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let’s get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta’aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He’s well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.**
Gonna have to put an nsfw tag on it after Elon Musk finds this
I can’t wait until images of all of the other planets are this clear
What few are talking about is that this picture has seriously significant impacts on the future of colonization. Because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
What’s those 3 large dark brown spots on mars’ left side
I’m not satisfied until we have an image as clear as google maps with street view included, so martians are freaked out when they see someone is taking pictures of their driveway.

this looks gorgeous on my 2k HD phone, gonna make it my wallpaper
That honestly looks amazing. Space is beautiful, no?
If you squint hard enough, you can see the last warmind
It’s weird to think that Earth is probably just as marked up by meteorites but we don’t see the impacts in photos from space, with all the water and life and so on.
Anyone else KINDA able to see something like Jabba the Hutt.
If you zoom in to upper right corner you can just about see Matt Damon
It looks like a world that was. When I look at the crevices it reminds me about how there used to be water there but it couldn’t sustain it like how Earth does
I’m elevated and sufficiently freaked out. It’s beautiful tho
I immediately had to create a wallpaper out of this. [Here it is](https://imgur.com/gallery/pNRPoUk) if anyone else wants it.  
  
EDIT: Desktop wallpaper to clarify
I remember a while back when one of the first photos were taken on the surface and sent to Earth. Everybody was surprised because it was so flat and barren and for some reason everyone was saying it sort of looked like Kansas. I wasn't expecting it, it was hard for me to picture the surface that way when you look at it from above, like this.
for some reason my brain always registers those images as renders. i have to remind myself that this is not a 3D model but a composite of actual photographs of *another planet*. Surreal
Why are the canyons on mars so different looking from canyons on earth?
Almost seeing the tiny houses owned by Area51 ailens.
We get pictures of Mars, and first thing we do is roast it.
Any clue what the clearest image of mars is from photo technology on the earth? I figure it might be a pleasingly striking comparison.

This looks delicious. I have a problem with food.
Asteroids crates hold special minerals and bacteria. Let's go get " Calvin "
Just putting this out there for those interested in great hard sci-fi about Mars: Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy, *Red Mars, Green Mars,* and *Blue Mars.* Dynamite stuff, which envisions an eventual total terraforming of Mars into an ocean planet.
Is it me or does that look like a big battle scar across it?
The two craters on the left side of the image, are those recent impacts (galacticly speaking)?
It's weird to think our ancestors will be able to see Olympus Mons with their own eyes.

I wonder who the first person to summit THAT motherfucker will be.
You should all read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy
What caused such a massive gash in the planet?
The valles marineris is the coolest shit ever, grand canyon looks like a tiny crack in comparison.
The (what I think are) craters on the left, odd that they're in an almost perfect line
That’s a graze wound, possibly from the claws of an intergalactic phoenix.
dosen't look clearer than the last time this was posted.
Can’t wait for the unrelenting reposts “taken from my backyard with my iPhone 11.
So what caused that huge ravine? Or what is the pervading theory?
You can clearly see where a large UFO crashed into it
Dang thats so clear i bet we could see Mark Watney
Someday, someone will see this beauty with their eyes. How magnificent
I just see a big ol’ face

Is it just me or does that look like a giant starship crash
Wow it looks like so much fun guys let's all ditch our lame planet right now.
Am I the only one seeing a ghost screaming face on the right side?
It needs to taste some of our greenhouse gasses.
*the McDonalds can go right there...yup in the middle*
I don’t get why earth only has a dozen craters visible from space but every other terrestrial object in space has thousands.
wow that’s the clearest image of mars ever taken.
Why does Mars look like it’s making the 😑 face?
The fuck? Why doesn’t dust or birds or asteroids or glare or SOMETHING make this picture blurry? This is incredible
Why don't they aim that MUTHERFUKER at the moon and see if there is a go cart and shit to show if people were really there.
Then what about the clearest image of Earth ever taken?
Now if only we could get a clear image like this of Olympus Mons.
It amazes me that we get so much coverage on a 3 lens iPhone yet I hear almost nothing about the amazing engineering that it takes to produce an image like this.
Am i the only one that sees a '•____•' face on mars?
The previous "earth", soon to be what Earth will look like, next stepping stone, Venus...
See if you can zoom in to get a good shot of the Exclusion zone because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon.

I feel like this exact photo was posted a few weeks ago, and got far less upvotes. 

(Cue the twilight zone music).

Edit: [Here it is](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c655if/the_clearest_image_of_mars_ever_taken/). 50k upvotes a mere two months ago, compared to 135k for this repost.
Photo quality decent I give it four and a half moons
Just.... look at that.
I would happily volunteer to go to Mars if I was ever given the chance, I don’t think I’d care if I died, as long as I had the chance to go into space and then land on Mars
What's the clearest image of earth ever taken?

ESA just published a very high res photo of Mars and it shows a very different planet. With well defined and visible polar ice caps,different colors and many more cratters. I mean... even if it's the other side, where are the fucking ice caps?

https://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2019/09/Mars_Express_view_of_Terra_Sabaea_and_Arabia_Terra
One day someone will be able to point to a place in the photo and say “that’s where I live”
Wow, look at those 3 perfectly aligned, and arguably same size, impact craters(volcanos?) on the left side, that's crazy
Wow.  For the first time since I was a kid I just thought about a favorite planet.  If they terraform Mars and colonize it, kids will look at Mars like I looked at NYC.  Some grand place I could move to when I turn 18.  Except now we are talking other planets.  I know it’s just a picture but seeing it this clearly makes it seem so much closer in every way.

The day we colonize Saturn is going to be a shit show.
Does anyone know what is speculated to have created that giant scar?
Whether we wanted it or not.... we’ve taken a clear picture of the surface on Mars
I want anal beads that are accurate to scale (comparatively) of the nine planets.

edit a word
Looks like it’s frowning at Earth as it knows we are destined for the same fate.
The picture is great. Because of that it is my wallpaper on my computer and IPad.
Hostile to life, no fresh water, no breathable atmosphere, lo gravity, freezing, bathed in suns radiation.
And just like that, a space race is born.

[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
This is the type of competitive atmosphere that must be encouraged both socially and politically. Don't forget that the last space race gave us a lot of the technology today we take for granted. 
Musk won't care if Boeing beats SpaceX. The net result is that we fucking go to Mars.

EDIT: I'm ok with this being my new top comment. Fuck yes.
Now THIS is a space race we can all get behind... it benefits humanity no matter who loses!

So if he wins will his hair come back like Elon's?
[Amazing response to this from Bobak Ferdowsi.](https://i.imgur.com/nOG8e2v.png)  
(He's an engineer at JPL and was part of the curiosity rover team)
When Elon said "Do it" all I could think of was the Emperor Palpatine meme
Elon is playing the infinite game. He doesn't care about his competition and is just trying to make his businesses be the best they can be. At least thats how it seems to me..
gotta be honest i think if Boeing actually wanted to they could be on mars in 4 years.
I honestly think he's just happy to have somebody to play with.
You know it must be so crazy to the creator of Twitter that his creation has been the platform for so many crazy, important, and historical moments.
At one time countries were competing to go to the moon, now it's companies competing to go to mars.  Makes me wonder who runs the world now? hmmm...
I took his "Do it" response as more of a "Do it, as long as someone does". 

I think Musk's aspirations and appreciation for his work supercede any race for the finish line.
[removed]
Breaking News: Boeing files several hundred patents crippling Elon Musk's rocket aspirations while Boeing begins to sell off assets from its space exploration division.

Joking of course, but unfortunately this is what most 'competition' and 'free market forces' have devolved in to.
United Airlines is going to beat up and drag off the first group to Mars
If this actually happens I might die happy.

First time since I was 10 that I see a glimmer of hope for the species.
This is thoroughly awesome. We as a species need more of this kind of friendly but driving competition. It helps drive business in an important sector forward as well as bring us closer to getting out to other places.
This is the kind of thing that put men on the moon
as long as someone gets there, he'll be able to get home.
Can we stop fangirling about Twitter crap and start getting excited when these companies actually do things about it?

I'm not saying they're not doing something about it (obviously they are), it's just that I don't want this PR to become a well-beaten and long deceased horse by the time we get to Mars.

Youre milking it. Don't milk it.


This private space race has been in the works for several years now. It's not really news; and Musk has always been like this with his competitors in all his businesses.
Please please PLEASE let us have another space race. So much technology, So much wonder, So much excitement...
And just like this we'll get a movie where Boeing CEO goes super saiyajin and literally beats Musk into the Mars. Thus Elon Musk will be first on the Moon and Boeing CEO will still have beaten him to the Moon.
Okay but like I think that Elon genuinely wants to see Boeing beat him
How does one pronounce Boeing? I've said Bow-ing all my life and never bothered to check if that was accurate.
I feel relieved as I an studying for Aerospace Engineering. I am not only excited, but hopeful for us.
Grandad, where were you when the Mars Race started? 
Well I had my dick in one hand and the other hand in a bag of Doritos.

What a time to be alive.
I mean I can challenge Usain Bolt to a race, but nobody else would call what follows an actual competition. 
Doubt Boeing will do it. The moment anything they're trying to achieve scares shareholders, they'll drop it for something safer and more cost effective.
It's looking more and more likely that history books on this era are going to be full of tweets.
Pretty sure it’s a publicity battle, but anyway.
100% guarantee that nothing will come of this. A conversation on twitter doesn't automatically mean a space race started
Lol, this isn't a space race, this is a PR race. Corporations have no higher ideals than profit, it tends to lead to myopic thinking, I'll call a flash in the pan on this one. 
4 years later; Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Boeing can hardly keep their planes in the sky how they gonna man a mission to mars?
A technology/space race that isn't fueled by hysteria and jingoism?? Sign me up!
I attended the congressional hearings on this before anyone was actually allowed to compete with Boeing and NG. The argument for a free market was competition is healthy and encourages innovation. Many members argued against this. 
That moment when you realize that creating competition was Musk's plan all along. 
Which is better: have two companies competing so you have the competitive atmosphere and additional motivation possibly, or two companies working together sharing data and resources? It seems like together they could do it faster, better, and cheaper. Maybe not though. Maybe by combining forces it would actually be slower as more layers of management? Either way it’s an exciting time for those of us watching in amazement. 
Can u make more comfortable airplanes first pls
This makes me so happy to see. We're going to be space bound soon
clever play from musk, boeing has to be closing in on reusable rockets or musk is just going to bankrupt them and claim another part of the worlds industry.
Yeah.... Nope. I doubt there will be any race. We're talking businesses and not countries. Businesses that need to show investors profits. Unless there is some immediate commercial gains that can be realized in these endeavors, market forces will determine the speed at which these companies push to reach their goals.

You do realize that both of these programs are funded by the US government, right?
[deleted]
Why couldn’t Kim Jong Un worry more about having shit on mars. Then we’d get more government funding that way.
The first space race was between two governments and its tax funded organizations. The new space race will be between two privately funded corporations with the backing of some government institutions. 
lol please there's no race.  If the SLS gets off the ground before SpaceX has gotten to mars I would be very surprised, and I say this more out of skepticism for Boeing then out of fanboi love for SpaceX
Finally a practical use for Twitter, getting a  private space race competition.  
Erhm...I know competition is cool and everything but imagine the world where Boeing and Musk collaborate. In that world we are probably trying to figure out how to get out of the solar system
Super intense like real intense like my butt is clenching from excitement intense.
I like his reply . It shows that he doesn't really care whose first. He wanted people to get encouraged  and try to achieve such a feat . It's a smart trick really to encourage action .
Wait please stop this evil capitalism... only over budget government programs can possibly go to mars. 
How long until I can be a proud asteroid miner, get screwed over by Earth and Martian oppression, and remember the Canterbury?
This is how I see it play out: 
* Elon will push the rocket like he usually does. boeing will be about as fast as he is.

* In Elons demtermination he will start his rocket up early. It'll blow up. In the explosion he will be injured. The investors flee from the "sinking ship". Elon withdraws from the public.

* A year later when Boeing is about to start it's rocket. Elon suddenly appears at the scene with a badass skar across his eye and a prostetic cyborg arm. He captures the space-ship and becomes a rogue space pirate! 

\*outer space silent arrrrrrr*
I was going to cheer on capitalism but then realized that I'm looking at Boeing.
Go get em, Elon.
I'm more afraid of the corporate space race than the one done by governments.
This is great and wonderful and I love the modern resurgence of space desires.

But I do not like that it is in the hands of private businesses. They must find a way to monetize. Even if it's just from the patents they develop from developing the technology, they still have certain pressures to do profitable space exploration, not necessarily scientific ones.
A marketer was born. Mars is a dead planet. It was a lot cooler before we knew that space was dead.
Man, what an exciting time! Can’t wait for the 2020s and 30s!
Elon Musk honestly wants them to win if they can do it faster than he can, and I love him for that.
This is why capitalism is usually pretty awesome.

I still can't believe we have a picture of space-time being heavily distorded.
This is so fucking awesome. But this one is from M87 right?  

I thought they were also going to show one of Sagittarius A*
The actual image looks waaaay better than I thought. Obviously rather blurry, but it matches pretty well with the best case simulations of what the image should look like.
Really cool achievement, I have no clue what I expected out of this picture but the idea still baffles me.
40 billion kms wide and 500 million trillion kms away.
This is too much for my tiny human brain to comprehend
This is Messier 87’s black hole. Very impressed by the quality.

I’m a bit puzzled though, I was sure we would be getting Sgr*.
I'm honestly just happy that so many people are interested in seeing this that the ESO website is getting hugged to death. What a great day for science.

EDIT: They just finished the conference with a Stephen Hawking quote and now I'm sad that he wasn't able to be here to see this amazing discovery.
"Black holes dont exist. You are crazy to think they do."

&#x200B;

"Black holes hypothetically might exist, but highly doubtful."

&#x200B;

"Black holes are mathematically proven, but no direct observed evidence"

&#x200B;

"Black holes have direct, observed, and corroborated evidence".

&#x200B;

All in one lifetime. While most people wont see a real-world impact in their daily lives from this just yet, the enormity of this scientific breakthrough will change humanity slowly but surely. Hopefully for the better.
RIP Stephen Hawking. He would have been absolutely elated to see this.
[deleted]
I can't believe I'm actually seeing this in my lifetime.

If you want to understand what you're looking at I recommend this video: https://youtu.be/zUyH3XhpLTo
For those curious as to what this actually is:

>The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around a black hole that is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sun
I know that this was what I was expecting to see but I’m still amazed by the photo
It's mind boggling to think that taking a picture of something that's 500 million trillion kms away is even possible.
Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!

Now what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the "point of no return" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).

Now, on a more fundamental level than "it's cool to have a picture of a black hole," there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!

Third, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)

A final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at "only" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!

Anyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!

TL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.

Edit: if you really want to get into the details, [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205) is the journal released today by *Astrophysical Letters* with all the papers!  And it appears to be open access!

Edit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.
Fucking unbelievable, In 100 of years in physics books is gonna be written:"In April 10th, the first photo of a black hole was released", it happened in my lifetime.
Welp Veritasium was exactly right.

What an exciting time to be alive.
I expected something 10 pixels but was throughly surprised at the detail!
I honestly don't think that's too dissimilar to what Interstellar created. Neat!
[removed]
Can that ring be different colours? Or does it stay orange. Sorry If it’s a dumb question
Looks about as terrifying as what you would expect from a black hole. 

That photo is making history, well done to everyone involved
Look ! A **SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE**

*Oooooooooh, you set my soul alight*
The idea of black holes has always been fascinating to me, but to actually see one, truly, is mind boggling. Space is awesome. 
Edit: I also see people saying they're disappointed. Don't be. This is amazing, and the fact that we get to see this is a gift to science and humans' understanding of space.
300 million times the size of earth. Can you even imagine....
that is the neatest thing I think I will ever see.
It's really cool that we all actually got to see this within our lifetimes.
It sucks that Stephen Hawking didn't get to see this
All of these scientists are so freaking excited and so am I. This is truly an amazing achievement!
Incredible image, so hard to really grasp the sheer extremes of physics being captured in this shot of M87's galactic core.

There are two vague extensions on either side of the accretion disc, are those polar jets of some sort?
[high res pic because site is down](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3yt4Y0XsAAtEdZ.jpg:large)
They fucking did it. And to think scientists were so spot on with their simulations and projections of how a black hole would look like, gives the scientists confidence I'm sure.

Makes me wonder what more they can learn with these images and what more interesting breakthroughs like this that my generation will witness.
Looks like a sun with a big black hole in the middle. Soundgarden knew.
Each telescope produced 350 **terabytes of data** ***PER DAY***.  Jesus, this was a huge project. Congratulations to all the scientists involved!
Still so weird to see... We don't even know what is happening 'inside'

I'd like to compare this black hole [picture](https://cdn.eso.org/images/newsfeature/eso1907a.jpg) with our pictures of [Pluto](https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2015/09/nasa-pluto-older-photograph-pixelated.jpg) before New Horizons did its flyby.  Pluto is 738 miles in diameter, roughly 7.5 ~~million~~ billion kilometers from earth, and has an angular size of 0.06″ – 0.11″.

This black hole's shadow is roughly 100 billion kilometers across.  That's massive, over 135 million times the diameter of Pluto.  But it is 55 million light-years away.  That is 5.20e20 kilometers away.  For comparison, for every kilometer of distance between Pluto and Earth, there are 69.4 billion kilometers between Earth and Messier 87's supermassive black hole.  The angular size would be just 0.0000397".

We struggled to get a grainy image of Pluto, but the combined efforts of our radio labs let us get a relatively clear picture of something that appears to be about 300 times smaller in our night sky.  If you tried to drop the black hole picture into the old Pluto picture while keeping the relative size accurate to what they'd be from Earth, the black hole picture wouldn't fill up 10% of a single pixel.  It is a massive feat of resolution.
This is how it looked like 52 million years ago.
I remember giving a class speech on Black Holes when I was in 8th grade.

All the giggling that went around the class at the mention of the term.

But as soon as I began to describe what it actually was, the entire class became fascinated at it.

Now 20 years after I had given that speech, I'm seeing this entity for the first time.

The feels.
Astounding.  We can now see an image of a black hole, in another galaxy billions of billions of kilometers away, to what appears to be a similar resolution to what Galileo would have seen the moons of Jupiter when he looked through his telescope a few hundred years ago
Ready to see this in every single pic related subreddit today
I'm at one of the key institutions with part of the team and it is just amazing to see this and know all the work that has gone into capturing this image
I looked at it thrice so that I could look at it for Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein too
So in other words, we've just objectively proven a lot of theoretical physics, haven't we? 

Fuckin' love science, man.
Does this mean we can, in the future, get an even better picture?
Shouldn’t you see only a circle of light? Because a black hole is a sphere?
Honestly creepy as hell.  Like an evil eye looking back at us
"Do not go gentle into that good night, rage, rage against the dying of the light"
This is incredible! But I thought it was going to be an image of Sag A* but this is from M87. Did I miss something?
I so wish Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking we’re alive to see this.   All my life the science of black holes has gone from very uncertain... to this!   To turning the Earth into a telescope to pull the real data into a real image of a REAL BLACK HOLE.   

A real black hole!  A real singularity inside of it!  The physicists must be going nuts.
Such a shame that Professor Stephen Hawking didn't get to see this day!

To be honest i'm very satysfied with this image. Everybody, including me, was like "Don't get your hopes up, it will just be some pixels". Of course it isn't exactly HD, but the fact that we can actually clearly see it is fantastic.
As a kid I wanted to get into astrophysics and I'd tear into every book I would find. Mars and black holes were my obsession. Whenever I'd read about black holes, I always felt like the authors despair about not knowing how it looks like was very evident. In every book I read too.

And now I'm staring at a picture of a black hole, it makes me giddy. I'm sure those authors feel the same too.
It took this long to get a picture of something that sucks in everything around it, including all light? If astronomers wanted a picture of my mother-in-law, they could have just asked.
This is already my new phone wallpaper. Absolutely incredible. What a time to be alive. I have a ***photograph*** of a black hole as my wallpaper
Now i know how the people who first discovered the planets or the Americas feel. I mean, hundreds of thousands of years from now humans (if we haven't destroyed ourselves) will be exploring our galaxy and expanding out from the solar system. Sure, we won't be around for that.

But in the entirety of human history, out of all the time we've existed and for all the time we have left, we were there to see the first ever picture of a black hole.

 Right here, right now, we were the first.
[removed]
Humanity: *Captures image of black hole, a concept so unfathomable it seems like science fiction, 50 million light years away, after the invention of a simple modern telescope 400 years ago*

Reddit critics: "a bit underwhelming"

lmao
Amazing thing to see. Glad I'm around for this.
So now is the accretion disk oriented in relation to us?  Light gets bent so much around the hole it's hard to tell if I'm looking "straight down" at the disk or if pointing towards us and we are looking at it edge-on.
I'm struggling to comprehend how big this is, both in importance of our understanding of the deep and mysterious world outside, as well as the size of this thing. 

Looking at it on a screen doesn't do to justice. 

Wow. I'm honoured and privileged to have seen this in my lifetime

Wow.
We know what Pluto looks like, now we know what a black hole looks like. What a neat time.

Guys, we're living on a full-page feature of a history book right now. So many years we've been on this planet, and this is the first image any human has EVER seen of a black hole! That's hard for me to wrap my brain around.
Astrophysicist working on quasars here! Just wanted to share my absolute amazement at this image and the ways this discovery will affect my work.

&#x200B;

The most incredible thing in this image is how closely our models predicted the accretion structure in such a deeply-relativistic regime. The simulations used to make these predictions relied on GRMHD - general-relativistic magneto-hydro-dynamics. This in an incredibly complex and difficult area of physics, far beyond general relativity on its own. Think of the simulations that manufacturing companies have to make using fluid dynamics for e.g. air flow around airplanes and cars. Dealing with the basic properties of a fluid such as its mass, compression, and temperature is difficult enough to require supercomputers *on its own, in constant gravity.* Now add magnetic fields and their interplay with the fluid. Then add self-attraction and variable gravity. *Then* add general relativity, with space-time, a moving and curving frame of reference which interplays with all of the above dynamically and non-linearly. It is simply astonishing that the outcome matches reality *at all.* This is by far the most extreme test of our understanding of GRMHD to date. It gives us a ton of confidence that the assumptions and simplifications that we make to even be able to run the models at all... are actually very correct.

&#x200B;

Next, there's the ability of black holes to drive jets. These jets have been observed directly in many galaxies including M87 but the physics behind their ejection is very debated. How does the direction of black hole 'feeding' relate to the largest, galaxy-scales of jets? How do they vary in time? Which part of the structure around the black hole launches the jets? With an image, a disc size, and time-variability (or lack thereof) we can suddenly build models with a lot fewer assumptions. Plus, our confidence in GRMHD is now a lot higher, and jet-launching is a deeply related to the magnetic fields around the event horizon.

&#x200B;

We have now reached the final scale in the study of quasars, after detecting inter-galactic jets, effects on the host galaxy, central velocity effects on stars, gas feeding reservoirs, and now the event horizon itself! I did not think this would happen in my lifetime. I'm jumping with excitement at all the new research which will come out of this!! 

&#x200B;

In the meantime, feel free to ask anything related to supermassive black holes / quasars.
It looks like the eye of sauron. Fucking awesome.
It's these scientfic achievements that makes everything else seem so insignificant. Just makes you pause for a moment in this hectic world and go 'Wow'. 

A real image of a black hole... insane just thinking about it. 
We're really honoured to see this image during our lifetime, massive props to the scientists and researchers out there putting in the hours to get us these breakthroughs.
What we’re seeing there is larger than our entire solar system with the mass of 6,500,000,000 of our suns. Truly mind boggling.
[deleted]
So all of Einstein's/the community's predictions about the black hole were really accurate? That's pretty cool.
Two years ago, I teamed up with a fellow redditor to try and take the most ridiculous moon shot we could come up with. Today, we proudly introduce our newest collaboration, a 174 megapixel look at our cosmic companion. Zoom in to check it out!

So great to have gotten to collaborate with you. Look forward to our future projects bud!

Edit: In case you were interested in what went into this photo, [Andrew has a long comment explaining it below](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/wtl9fj/two_years_ago_i_teamed_up_with_a_fellow_redditor/il4q5rz/)

>A huge shoutout to u/Idontlikecock for capturing the color data that went into this shot. Without it, it would have been a dreary gray. The color in this image is real, but presented with increased saturation so it is easily visible to our eyes.

Could somebody mark the landing spot of Apollo 11 on this picture? A red dot or circle or something similar?

This looks AMAZING. I've been using another moon shot for my ~~current desktop~~. It's getting replaced with this!

Edit: deleted the image off Imgur. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/JpcBnoZ.jpg) it is again.
Isn't there some law against posting high-res photos depicting the locations of military bases?
Is this the fully uncompressed version? Would love to set this as my wallpaper.
Out of curiosity are we able to see where the moon landing took place in this photo?
This photo is so big, it’s crashing my Apollo app. Amazing.
This is going to be INSANELY helpful to me and my high school astronomy students when we talk about the moon this year, because your photo is so high resolution you can see the old fault lines of the moon from back when it was partially molten.

EDIT: listen to u/rtphokie, y'all. Remind kids that the moon isn't actually this colorful.
How does one get a giant print of this to hang on one’s wall?
So the moon is a bit red-ish? We just unable see it here on earth with naked eye?
This feels like a really stupid question, but since the moon is not really that big, would it be possible to see remains of the moon landing sites on a picture like this? Vehicle tracks maybe? 
Seems like the resolution is just a little bit too blury.
That's a cool picture!
Also I now know without any doubts that I do not wish to live on the moon!
Very beautiful photo, thank you for uploading this
I really enjoy your work and have always wondered how you choose which phase of the moon to display. I'm sure its been asked before but could you shed some light (pun intended) on that please?
This is awesome! Both of you should be proud. Keep up the great work!
you can really see the flatness of the moon here, excellent
Really interesting and well done. Minimal knowledge on this type stuff but the impact craters are boom plop type but are there instances of a sideways impact. Such as skipping a stone in a creek?
This is why I sub here, such amazing work, thank you!
Badass. Would be interesting if you could layer on a state or country for a size comparison
So where is apollo 11 lunar lander :)

Great shot by the way.
What the fuck is all that brown stuff I thought the moon was white
This is ridiculously good absolutly astonishing
How is there color??? When I look up all I see is white… does the color show up the closer you get?
OP random question: at this res, would it be possible to see the larger items left behind from the Lunar landings?
awesome work you guys!  one of the nicest moon shots Ive seen
Lmao I went to go and save it and reddit just noped out
Thank you - I was going into my senior year of high school when I watched the first moon landing, and I never thought I'd get to see the moon at this detail. It's so beautiful & it's brought back the feeling of awe I had in 1969.
Has anyone here ever taken a step back and wondered in amazement how planetary bodies and moons like ours are so perfectly spherical (most of the time)?
Has the moon always been multicolor?? I always thought the whole landscape was just gray..
With an image this clear, can anyone tell what type of cheese it's made of? I've been wondering since I was 4 years old.
Am I the only one zooming in and trying to find the flag?
Why not the [681 Gigapixel image of the moon?](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/gigapan)
Question; how is it that The moon, being so much smaller than earth, is absolutely riddled with crater impacts?

Oh and awesome picture, thanks for sharing
Beautiful! Would look awesome as a lock screen on my phone
Between this picture and that amazing picture of the sun that was posted a few days ago on here I'm going to lose my fucking mind. Absolutely amazing job guys!!! Holy shit.
That’s so trippy for think humans stepped foot on the moon
This is insane! Wow! Never thought I still could be impressed by a moon shot at 46!

Kudos guys!
Stupid question here, would it be possible to see any lunar landing paraphernalia?
I have been looking for 2 hours now and have not found any cheese. What else have I been lied to about
That's an insane picture.  I wonder if you search hard enough if you could possibly see the shadows of the flags left up there.
Serious question. Considering how amazingly detailed these moon photos are getting, how long do you think before we can see any remnants of the Apollo program.
I'm not really into space photography, but this is one of the most beautiful photos I've ever seen. Are the colours real or added by you?
i love that fact that this community brought together 2 strangers to put together an excellent shot. bravo, you two.

I am such a nerd, I have so many questions.

1. Does anyone know why the moon has perfect circles?
2. Are those impact craters?
3. Why doesn't the Earth have something similar? Thinking maybe atmosphere differences and the Earth is covered in water. 

Such a cool photo!
What’s with the coloring? Surely that’s not true color?
Hey this shot is too blurry, could you take another?
[deleted]
My old man is an astro nut, as soon as I saw this I had to show him. He was pretty excited to see it and scroll around.

I'm pretty interested in space stuff myself, and my wife studied rocks in college (which is good for me and my rocks for brains), so pretty sure the whole family's going to be getting some enjoyment out of this.
I. am. astonished. 

More so than I've ever been from a picture, in my 26 years.

Just fucking incredible.
Epic....nice work.....got li ls to your other photos?
How big are some of those craters are we talking miles wide? Surely they have to be to be that large and visible
Beautiful!  Thanks for the share! You should be proud!
That is the most detailed, beautiful picture of our Moon i have seen in a very long while. Jawdropping shot.
This is amazing & I was downloading it for a wallpaper before I'd even read that comment. 

I love the colours, every image like this just fills me with new levels of astonishment at how there's such a massive untouched place so close to us. It's so cool zooming in and exploring all the little details and trying to imagine the scale of each crater and contour. It would be awesome to go there one day and explore in person.

Great work both of you
Damn it your last post was my phones background till the james webb telescope images were released. And now it’s back to the moon. Fantastic job
What sorcery is this?! I can’t take my eyes off it!
My dude this hurts my brain on how awesome this looks
Great picture! So clear and sharp! 
Off subject: It does make it clear (pun intended) that living on the moon would be impossible because there is just too much space debis slamming into it all the time !
Holy shit! Usually these don’t work out for me very well, but this is amazing!
Kinda unrelated and also a little lazy to search on Google rn but what’s the average surface temp thats exposed to the sun on the moon and whats the temp of the dark side?
When was the last time we had a big impact on the moon that was visible from the earth in written history?
Is this what the moon would look like to the human eye?
Um, this is fucking amazing. I feel like I’m witnessing a historical moment.
I’ve been going through a lot of dark stuff with my mental health and some abuse from my family, but this image really made me feel so happy. I love the attention to detail. Really made me smile. ☺️
How big would a dude look from this size? A city? That tree in Hawaii?
Can’t see the American flag. . . Disappointed . . .
Are those red spots actually red or is it the cameras?
Can I use this at my planetarium?? Let me know please!
Absolutely beautiful. I think this might be the best veiw I've seen. Thank you so much.
Can you post something higher resolution please? I can’t see Neil’s footprint
If you know where to look, you can see the Nazi moon base!
Damn F 174 megapixels the moon’s pores are super exposed. I bet the moon feels a tad self conscious.
Wahoo!!!  Finally can update my desktop background from the original one two years ago hahaha!  It helped me, along with Universe sandbox, get my then 4 year old into studying space.  He's been obsessed ever since, can't wait to show him the new background when he wakes up!!!

&#x200B;

Thank you for kicking ass!
Anyone else see a collapsed lava tube smack dab in the middle of the photo?  (enlarge and put scroll bars in the center vertically & horizontally)  There is a small/medium crater with a crack heading east and a crack heading northwest.  The northwest one looks like a string of pearls which must be landslides.
Any way you can get a pic of the other side?

Your file so big it made my Reddit app crash (after the zooooom). Is the red iron?
Thanks to reddit compression we can’t actually zoom in to much without it getting pixelated. Mind sharing a download link?
This photo is so savage I’ve tried to save it at least a half dozen times. Every time my shit crashed. I had to take a screen shot. Long live this photo!!
That is such great detail I was expecting to be able to find the American flag while looking around.
Damn my dudes this is awesome! Thanks for the share 👍
That's awesome. It almost looks too unreal.
Great work!
This just gave me a space boner. Shooting for the moon and its landing among the stars
I opened the image and thought "that is pure lunacy" then chuckled to myself at the pun.
So you are saying that the moon is actually kind of red-ish?
Is it possible to make out the flag left there?
https://imgur.com/UhjgV8U.jpg What did I find here? Is this a hair on the lens or is this a moon structure?

Zoomed out slightly

The alien radar dish that discovery channel shared as facts 20 years ago is missing.
Should'nt it be white or grayish?? Is that its true color?
I never knew the moon was so rich in iron!
Also, have the scrunchy bits in the center of the craters been probed?
If you look carefully you can see the Hellmouth.
I audibly gasped. This is breathe taking and just makes me remember why I love photography again
Still blows my mind that that thing is made of cheese.
There's a gash in the big eyebrow looking ridge, the orange above the blue looking eye-socket in the top-left corner of the image. That gash looks like a dried river bed. You can see how it narrows, and in doing so the water would have been backed up and rotated and swirled and it would have carved out those two bowls in that channel. Then it slips through into a small pool before continuing down the waterfall and into the larger crater below.

It's so clearly a riverbed, I have a hard time imagining what else could have formed it.

Found it. This image posted has better resolution than the reconnaissance orbiter. Amazing.
That's just ridiculous.  I spent a good 10 minutes just scoping...so beautiful!

Someone wanna make this into a wallpaper for phones?
I highly recommend looking into Andrew's Patreon. TONS of great images and there is even a tier for aspiring astrophotographers. (no affiliation)

Amazing image of the moon!  Connor Matherne was nice enough to give me permission to make this video from the picture.   [https://youtu.be/TbAty3nJRlo](https://youtu.be/TbAty3nJRlo)
Stuff like this makes me emotional. I really appreciate being awestruck, thanks.
Well, this is freaking magnificent! I have no words to explain the awe that I feel staring at this photo.
Hey OP, pretty cool youre in the news https://www.sciencealert.com/ridiculously-detailed-new-image-of-the-moon-is-a-masterpiece-of-space-photography
The detail is impressive. As a past avid astrophotographer who focused heavily on the moon and planets, I dont care for the color, the shine on the solar side, and the starry background at all. But the surface detail is stunning. I use to love taking 16, 36, 64, panel mosaics of the moon. Cool shot. Would be nice to see a version with natural color, no shine, and no stars.
Can you upload this to commons.wikimadia.com (the image repo of all the Wikipedia projects) so it's preserved for all of human kind and can be used for educational purposes in any moon related article and beyond? I'd gladly help you!
What I strongly dislike about your aggressive advertising is the fact that you refuse to even reply to messages about unedited photos. I don’t want to see a photoshopped, or as you say “color corrected”, image. I want to see the visible spectrum only, as humans would see through a telescope. This goes for all your captures, sun especially.
This person is a NASA sympathiser ! It’s not real , the tides are an invention of the lizard people ! 
Be really , bloody awesome photo ! Thanks for sharing something that shows the beauty of what’s out there
Some areas are weirdly blurry… but a pretty good try!
I didn't know NSFW post were allowed in this place. This looks awesome!
Awesome shot. 

And with that im done with this sub cause im sick to death of the millions of moon photos
Incredible. I want this to be an actual wallpaper… like 8ftx8ft. I could stare at this image for hours examining each small crater and texture.
This is a really cool picture, but how many times are you going to post it?
The kind of thing to set your perspective straight, isn't it? I imagine there are a posse of NASA employees who are looking at this pretending not to cry and failing. Our objectively very boring pocket of space is so beautiful, one almost dreads the idea of what exists beyond our reach.

It's a nice image but you've drastically increased the saturation and this is not accurate color wise.
This is great! Or it least it would be if the moon was real. You guys are so stupid for thinking that the moon is an actual thing. It is just a cardbord cutout the guvermint hangs from the sky sphere to control the dairy industry, and to draw attension away from the lizerd people. They have all camras edit out the string on the top. Of corse you imbeciles would know that if you did like 5 minutes of research on Facebook! You really think your stethoscope could take such detald pictures of another planet!? SMH. Gosh, some people!
You teamed up with a Redditer to take a picture of the moon………

Is this another one of those composite images.

AKA fake/photoshopped
Idontlikecock u should be made aware of a confusing time that occurred here in the SF Bay Area. About 5 years ago it became common for black males out of Oakland to refer to the pussy as cock. They’d say things like I hit the cock or she wouldn’t let me get the cock. I’m not sure how this occurred but it happened. A very confusing time.
Falcon Heavy has a successful launch!!

For those asking: Elon confirmed that they did NOT successfully recover the center core. Only 1 of the intended 3 engines was able to re-light for the landing burn, and it struck the water near the droneship.

>The center one lit but the outer two did not, and that was not enough to slow the stage down. Apparently it hit the water at 300 miles per hour and took out 2 of the engines on the drone ship. That sounds like some pretty fun footage, so if the cameras didn't get blown up as well then we'll save that for the next blooper reel.

Source: [SpaceX post-launch press conference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORTP545vAc)

Overall this was still a hugely successful launch for SpaceX - congrats to all involved.

**UPDATE**: [After spending several hours parked in orbit around the Earth, the second stage successfully made its third and final burn, pushing its orbit beyond even the original stated goal of Mars and all the way out to the asteroid belt.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/961083704230674438) That means the primary mission has officially been completed.

**UPDATE 2**: [SpaceX issued some corrected orbital data - aphelion is actually 1.71 AU rather than the originally reported 2.6.](https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/961394843648954368) That puts it just past Mars orbit, not out to the asteroid belt.
Unbelievable to see this live (on YouTube). Wow. I really wish I had been there in person.
My dash cam captured the launch and the vibration shook the entire car! https://youtu.be/Wtx1yMneTQk

Cheering is the press and SpaceX VIPs on the terrace behind.
A mannaquin dressed in a spacesuit is now actually driving a Tesla to mars while listening to David Bowie. With the roof down. What a time to be alive.
I laughed so hard when someone *accidentally* called it the "Fuckin heavy" about 20 seconds before launch.
I'm new to all this stuff, but... did I just watch a giant rocket lift off, launch a car into space, and then fall back down to earth and land in the exact spot from which it lifted off?
That landing of the boosters. HOLY SHIT!

That was impressive as hell!
I was waiting for the reveal that it's actually Elon in the car.
That synchronised landing was incredible. If the central core lands, it was a flawless demonstration. 
[I'm done.](https://twitter.com/Advil/status/960983292731445255)
"...and the Falcons have landed!"

That was a gorgeous clip

* startup: successful 
* liftoff: successful
* max-q: survived 
* booster engine cutoff: successful
* main engine cutoff: successful
* fairing deploy: successful
* starman: in orbit
* boosters land: successful
* stage 2 shutdown: successful
* core lands: unsuccessful (it ~~landed, just not as planned~~ crashed)

9/10 is very impressive.

It will be perfect if the core survives, but don't make it a big deal if it failed. A lot of data to learn from either way. 

edit: core landing update.
Was there a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy reference in the car? ("Don't panic")

Incredible. I'll always remember watching this, the same way our previous generations did. I got goosebumps seeing it disappear into the atmosphere.

Life on Mars playing right as they hit space was so awesome. Great launch.
5th grade science teacher in Florida here. The launch delay pushed it past dismissal. When 3:45 was approaching I went searching for some students. Found an after school coding club, brought them outside and set up the stream on my laptop. We watched the incredible live stream and looked South towards Canaveral to see the rockets in the sky.

Those boys and girls were out of their minds excited about what was going on. I was so inspired by their enthusiasm. Thank you SpaceX for reinvigorating the love of science and exploration in these young people.
One of the few benefits of living on the east coast of Florida. I'm about 4 hours away and could still see that thing. It was FAST. I've seen many launches from here but this one e was gone out of sight in a minute. Crazy 
Elon can now phone NASA every morning and ask, 'Dude, Where's my car?"

Seeing those two booster come down together - in-mother-fucking-credible. Totally worth ignoring my co-workers for 10 minutes.

Now, what happened at the drone ship?
Absolutely surreal experience. We've witnessed history, folks. 
[removed]
If you told me 10 years ago that some dude was going to put his own electric car in his own rocket and then blast David Bowie through the stars, I would have told you to go fly a kite. 
Fifty seven years ago, I watched - live -  Alan Shepard launched to be the second man to orbit the Earth.  

Today, I sat in front of my computer, sobbing uncontrollably as Falcon Heavy lifted off successfully, inaugurating a whole NEW ERA of space exploration.  It was truly an amazing experience for me.  

My brother was one of the engineers on the F1 rocket at the space center in Huntsville, originally Redstone Arsenal.  He even worked with some of the German scientists who were spirited to the US after WWII.  

During the 70's and 80's, I worked on several satellite projects and one of the Apollo missions in various ways.  

Today, I feel that the future is here.  I am so very proud of everyone who worked on this project.  It was flawless!  And I know how difficult that is.


Those two side boosters landing same time was like the sickest thing I've ever seen...chills

::immediately quits job, goes back to school and gets advanced degree in aerospace engineering::


Now I wanna see all 3 pieces come down and land!

2/2!
I know that we have plenty of pics of the Earth from orbit by now, but for some reason this screenshot I grabbed is just blowing my mind - https://imgur.com/so6bBU5. 

Edit: another one.... https://imgur.com/a/wOx0o. I am imagining a (very) distant future in which we can simply drive off planet. I have to admit I teared up watching the launch, I can't even explain why, it's just so cool! 
Did the core make it? I just saw the stream, but they didn't say for sure it survived
That was amazing. Absolutely amazing. Loved the "Don't Panic" on the dash. 
I still can't believe they [launched a car into space](https://i.imgur.com/9mKqLqE.jpg). That was absolutely incredible.
I never got to experience the Space Shuttle launches but man I imagine this is the feeling many felt watching all those years ago. Absolutely incredible and historic. 
I just watched a man use a rocket to launch a car into space for the next billion years. Then I watched the boosters perform a synchronized, undamaged landing.

We're in the future.
I remember a time when we didn't have cars in orbit around the sun.
This shit is going to inspire a whole new generation of future coders, flight engineers, mathematicians, astronauts and all kinds of people who look up at the sky today who might just be there *Tomorrow*.

Thank you SpaceX. [I certainly dream of it again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmQsrXLofMY)
Seriously I wasn't expecting the boosters to land simultaneously. Told my wife, "Babe if they land at the same time and don't explode, then I will."

This is the beginning of a new age!

edit: added a word.
Probably the greatest picture of all time https://i.imgur.com/JDpTTpg.jpg
GEICO: Hello Mr. Musk, how can I help you today?

Elon: Yes, I'd like to report that my car has gone missing. I don't believe anyone will be able to locate it on Earth.
What's the story with the center core?  They said it landed.  Pics or it blew up.

Regardless, it was amazing to watch!  Those side booster landings were incredible.

EDIT: It didn't land, got it.  It was still an awesome test all around!
Trying not to cry at work about a rocket successfully launching. 

This is so beautiful to watch. 
I’m pretty sure Elon Musk just expertly disposed of a body. 
Damn just wait until we look back at this, what do you think people will say?


Also whaaaats uup PHD student from the 2120s writing your paper on the social impact on the development of rockets! I hope you're accessing this Reddit archive on Mars!

For the rest of human history there will be a fucking car in space!!!

20 years from now there will be conspiracy theories about how it was all fake and done on a sound stage in order to sell more cars. 

Internal source confirming the core has been lost.

Also confirmed by audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B_tWbjFIGI&feature=youtu.be&t=2289
Did the core end up landing?!  They cut the stream off!
Really hoping that Center core made it down ok!
So canonically, this is how the movie Heavy Metal starts right?

I'm 61 years old and I never thought I'd see something like this again. 

Let's hope we avoid a repeat of 1972 with that LEM lifting off the Moon and then nothing for 45 years (although Cassini-Huygens and Curiosity brought tears of joy to be fair).
I know this sentiment is shared among the rest of my friends and peers here at /r/space...  but seriously, this is history in the making, live and available for everyday people to watch.  For young space-travel enthusiasts, professionals, hobbyists...  this is a grand day.  I'm literally shaking.

This spring, I am heading back to school to study astrophysics.  I know that it's a long way down the road, but seeing SpaceX land its first booster a couple years ago inspired me to start the process of cleaning up my life, going back to school, and contributing whatever I can to this incredible and amazing field.

I love you all.  This is a joyous day!
Saw [this](https://i.imgur.com/noM0glO.jpg) on their careers page after the launch. Looks like it worked! 
Is losing the core a big deal? How bad is it? I don't know much about all this. Huge congratulations from Russia - what an achievement! Phenomenal.
Why did Elon Musk send a Tesla Roadster into space? 

Because the resale value will Skyrocket. 
amazing, any word on the core booster landing yet?

My dads a driver for SpaceX delivering 1/4 million dollar parts for the company. He has about 7 Falcon 9 patches that have flown in space. Calling him after the launch I'm sure that was the most important part of his life putting my birth to shame.... I'm not even sad, GO DAD AND SPACEX!!!!

This is amazing ^
I got mad goosebumps and frisson watching all of that, this is the new age. We've just witnessed history.

Launch countdown at 18:53
Landing at ~26:26
The Tesla Roadster, fastest car in the universe!
In my opinion, SpaceX just cemented their position at the head of space flight capability. To me, they are now ahead of NASA. 
Half the time they said “Falcon Heavy” I misheard it as “Fuckin Heavy” and it made it way funnier and badasser
Any news on the central core? The camera were cuts during the final landing, no news on the drone so far.
Watching this helped pull me out one of the worst depressions I've dealt with in a **loooong** while. Witnessing this historical event at all, let alone *live*, made me feel like my problems that are causing me so much internal conflict and pain don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. I have no idea if it will last, but I'm feeling hopeful no matter what happens. Nothing is going to take this away from me but me.
I’m a teacher and live streamed it for my class and the rest of my hallway. The kids were appropriately amazed. The teachers...we were like little kids on Christmas. Amazing. We are living in the future. 
[deleted]
one of the most impressive mind blowing things i ever saw ... and it only took 4minuters to get to 10000km speed with 110km altitude orbit ... and not even 9 minutes total including landing the boosters ...mind fucking blown ..and this was achieved by a private entity ... as a test :D ..wow ... if only we did this all the time instead of developing tanks and submarines with more nukes  
One day there probably be a mission on Mars that goes wrong and that Roadster will play a vital role in getting the astronaut back to earth.


*Oh wait*
Live view of starman 

https://youtu.be/aBr2kKAHN6M
Part of me thinks Elon is an amazing showman and the center core landed... and there is gonna be a kickass "Surprise motherfuckers!" as it floats into the dock.
Watching those 2 boosters land together literally made me shed a tear (or two.. or three) so beautiful! Fingers crossed for the core.
So is the Tesla just on it's own now floating towards Mars?
[removed]
Watched this in vr with a room full of strangers across the globe. This is the future. 
Can someone do the math:

With its current speed, how long until the roadster surpasses the cumulative mileage of every car ever?
The starman is such a mind blowing view I took some screen shots from the live. The res isn't really there, so they can't be desktop wallpapers, hopefully mobile one's:
[Starman in fuckin space with the fuckin earth](https://imgur.com/a/zkIWO)

No one is going to complain about to the range of an electric car now.
I was having dinner with some mates at the pub when we realized that Musk's big dick rocket was being broadcast on live TV. By pure chance, we looked just in time for the launch, as the countdown was starting.

Fuck me that was a beautiful sight.
Watching those two boosters come down was absolutely incredible. It was equal parts beautiful and surreal. 

I cannot believe I just watched a car get launched into space. The future is so fucking cool and I am so happy I'm alive to see this. 
Is there news about the center core? Did it land?
Anyone confirmed Elon is still on earth and not in the boot on his way to Mars?
At 38:27 I think they said "We lost the center core".
Hearing “The Falcons have Landed” was such a rush. Seems like it will be looked back upon as a historic quote! 
That dual landing was very science fiction - I feel like im living in the future.
