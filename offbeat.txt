The internet has nominated the Twitter employee who shut down Trump's account for a Nobel Peace Prize

Eleven random tweets expressing support, only one of which actually mentions the Nobel Prize at all? I could find eleven tweets condemning Twitter for that too. This is pure clickbait OP.
The internet? Like whole internet? Interesting.
Well that's fucking stupid

The first Nobel prize awarded for edginess. 
“The internet,” so, nobody then? 
Some people are so happy to dislike Trump that they ignore the fact that this whole thing reveals how poor Twitter's security is, how easily a random person on staff can do what they want with user accounts. Had this happened with someone else then Twitter would rightfully be called out on it by the general media and public. But because it was Trump they can get away with it.

"The internet has nominated.."

The dumbest thing I've read all day. 
So edgy.
You celebrate Trump's Twitter account being removed? Where does it end? How would you like it if Twitter or Facebook or reddit just removed your account? This is the kind of things that happen in China Cuba Venezuela and Zimbabwe. But, reddit is full of socialist buffoons. Socialist censorship tactics are celebrated here. 
this is so dumb and pathetic

Oh goodie, another self-identifying anti-trump sub to add to my /r/all filter list.
Why not? Since obama got one for nothing
Well, this is a stupid post. 
He deserves it as much as Obama did when he got it. 
[deleted]
According to who? Reddit and left wing media? What a surprise lol.
Are you western people fucking serious?
This is insubordination and childish disrespect.
why not? gave the nobel to murderin obama so it must be reserved for the baddies these days.
How will Drumpf ever recover? 
Isn't Trump also nominated?

"The internet" ಠ_ಠ
God damnit I wish "news" outlets would stop pretending a tiny handful of tweets means "everyone" is saying this or that. 

At this point I've lost count of how many times some news headline reads something like "THE INTERNET IS OUTRAGED ABOUT ____" only to read the article, then search Twitter to find out it was 2 people.... 2 fucking people made an angry comment and we declare that as "THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS UP IN ARMS ABOUT THIS!"

Fuck there was a headline several months ago about the "outrage" over some hashtag war going on on Twitter. Except when I went to see wtf was going on on Twitter only FOUR PEOPLE had used this hashtag... the other 10 uses I found were the god damned new outlets themselves tweeting about the "hashtag war."

We want net neutrality!

And...

We also celebrate censoring people on the Internet because we don't like them!
EPIC WIN XDDDDDDDD
Nobel prizes are supposed to award a lifetime commitment to a cause eventual resulting in spectacular success or discovery.

They've become total dog shit awards. 
a nobel peace prize for shutting down free speech? sounds great.
Stupid question regarding trump and twitter from a welshman

I am vaguely aware he uses his own twitter handle, but why does he not use the potus one?

Second, would you dude have been in more trouble if he deactivated the potus handle? 
There is no public nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize, at least by the public.  The real process does not publish "nominees" in any category.  So whenever you hear someone say, so-and-so was "nominated for a Nobel Prize!" your bullshit detector should be pegged.

Usually whenever this is said about anyone, it is because some newspaper editor or other public figure "nominated" the person in question, but in fact, it carries no weight.  It would be like me saying I nominate myself for a Nobel Prize.

Boom.  Done.  Now I can put "Nobel Prize Nominee" on my resume.

The real Nobel committee does not publish names of "nominees" under consideration for any prize.

THIS ISN'T THE FUCKING OSCARS.
Guys, literally anyone can nominate anyone for the Nobel Peace Prize. The whole concept of being "nominated" for it is therefore completely pointless.
That's not how the nominations work. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize#Nomination
Retarded.  Fake.  Gay.
He would be more deserving than Obama ever was but I still don't think he should be nominated. This award is near meaninglessness political propaganda now. 
No they didn't.
What a dumb post
"The Internet" brought to you by the people that exposed "The hackers known as 4chan".
Clickbait 
Yeah but who the fuck is "the internet"? Or was there some vote I missed out on that the entirety of the internet voted on? Or does one person saying something on Twitter count as "the internet"? 
- Beep boop I have detected "Trump" in headline beep boop 

#machine crunching noise

- beep boop Analysis complete headline title 87% negative beep boop

- initiate up vote ... Beep boop 
Well Obama got the prize so it already has lost all value and meaning.
How do posts like this work, anyway? Comments are scathing, the title is factually incorrect, yet it skyrockets on my front page with thousands of upvotes. Do large amounts of people upvote merely because of the anti-Trump message regardless of merit or is it a form of automatic vote manipulation of sorts?

hahaha the biggest win the left gets is 11 mins of a disgruntled employee disabling President Trump's account. Take this L libs lmao
How sad and pathetic. 
Kinda sad you lie and use the term "internet" as a whole instead of "a select few" (actually less than 15)

The DESPERATE Left strikes again
It's nice to know that the internet is into shutter by down the speech of people we don't agree with.  /s
**Internet** cannot care less.
While a lot of people have the opportunity to nominate someone for the Peace Prize (every Professor in the world for example), "the internet" is surely not one of them
the internet also declared HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG a good logo for Mountain Dew
Crazy there near 17k upvotes and every comment is saying this is stupid. 
The entire Internet? I don't remember being consulted on this. 
"the Internet"... Lol, so the Internet consists of a group of SJW's
[deleted]
Let's all remember Obummer has won one before.  The award isn't isnt exactly what it used to be.
Trump tweeting is one of the most hilarious and awesome things in the internet.  And the lardass landwhale who did it is a lardass landwhale.

Maybe she should lose some weight and be an example to others instead of eating the servers.
Yes reward people for taking someone else's (free) speech away. Bravo!
And they deserve it.
[deleted]
He needs to get off of twitter and do his damn job anyway. This should have happened months ago.
Nobel is a meme
Didn't give it to Mishima, Evola or Spengler
Gave it to Obama for peace (lol)
That's fucking retarded. 
Hitler is Trump.
"The internet" = a dozen leftist twitter users apparently. But yeah, Trump totally has no point about fake news. 
ITT: Trump supporters whining about Trump hate. 

In all honesty, fuck you. 
I voted for Trump. He needs to shut up his mouth and shut down his Twitter.
The left still thinks they're winning. 

LOL!
lol he is getting a federal charge instead
This wouldn't even be a joke because it's so damn necessary & courageous.
No it has t
No it hasn’t. First time I see that website in my life
I think saying 4chan winning the Presidency for Trump was more of a reality than this.
fuck you, trump!
Derp
This is the dumbest thing I've read all day.
Who's in charge of the internet nomination committee? I felt dumb reading that title
The internet is a person?
Who is 'the internet's OP? Is he related to 4chan?

Wow don't sort by controversial folks
Breaking News: President Trump resigns due to dozens of Anti-Trump memes on Reddit.
nb4 Aryan circlejerk
In today's edition of Not Reading Past the Article's Headline....
Yes!!!!!
the internet also nominated HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG for the new Mountain Dew name. So YAY! WE DID IT LEREDDIT!
Seriously if you’re gonna be bitching about Trump the next 4 years, you’re gonna turn it into 8. So shut the fuck up and get over it. If you are a US citizen he IS YOUR GOD DAMN PRESIDENT. 

If you are NOT a US citizen, then why the fuck are you even commenting on our president. Shut the fuck up and stay out of our country’s business. 
I guess the guy will be launching drone attacks or arming terrorists if he wins.  Don't want to break precedent!
Well considering they gave Obama a nobel peace prize it really doesn't mean shit now does it?  
well at least if he won there will be someone less deserving than obama.
"the internet" as in a few college-aged males whose mother's didn't breastfeed them so heir IQ is 5-6 points below what it should be
About as much worth it as Obamas NPP was.
well that was fucking retarded
The Internet is a bunch of fucking idiots.
what kind of nonsense is this?
The Internet has spoken, it's official! 
Fake news for real though. Wtf is this??
Anyone talking about the fact that the Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a 35% shareholder at Twitter (The largest after the Director/co-founder) was arrested on corruption charges just yesterday?
This would make lil Donnie "two scoops" Moscow so SAD!
I find it ironic that those opposed to Trump want his Twitter shut down. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? His Twitter activity makes him look bad.

ITT r/the_donald thinking they could enjoy their weekend, but instead they have to spend their day on reddit whining...

What am I talking about, enjoying their weekend, pffft as if they go outside.
Not all the internet there’s the basket of deplorables
No we didn't , quit ur bullshit .. sincerely The Internet 
This has nothing to do with any form of security. This simply has to do with what employees have permission to do. This employee clearly had access to deactivate account. He didn’t pull Mission Impossible shit. Lets be honest here. Trump being the president is the only reason he isn’t banned. I’m okay with some official having twitter. But, if you’re a 70+ year old man being the president and throwing 13 year old tantrums. Take his account away. 
Not like it means much, they also have given one to a person who has dropped 28,000 bombs, and killed another Nobel Peace Prize receiver 
Sure, why not, but it needs to be in a non scientific non peace keeping category. Perhaps a prize in humanitarianism
...the internet has nominated...

Really...how?

*sigh*
Hey a guy who killed thousands of civilians with drone strikes won, I think anyone is eligible these days. Give it to him!
Well, that website definitely doesn't have any biases that's for sure.
Should have posted this in politics if you wanted people to ignore the source/article and jump on the hate-train. 
Reddit will upvote the dumbest shit just because it's insulting Trump.
This guy has come closest to finally finishing the drumpf disaster than anyone yet. Step it up Democrats!
yeah!hooray for less freedom of speech!!!  
let's give the man a nobel prize!
Yes, let's reward bad behavior with rewards. I'm glad trump got those 20+ Saudi's that had their finger in 9/11 yesterday. We'll probably seize all their $ and stock.
You guys find every subreddit to invade. 
Well makes sense since the Nobel Peace Prize literally means nothing anymore. Especially since Obama won after the most brutal and extensive drone bombing campaign the world has seen. The only thing that doesn’t make sense is that the internet votes. How exactly does the internet vote? I didn’t realize the internet was a person and capable of voting. 

It's all the left has. Lol
Well I mean, Obama won one while being responsible for the most extensive droning campaign (with massive civilian casualties), destabilized Libya leading to massive death and destruction to this day, and allowed the selling of AR-15s to drug cartels ending in the death of an American farmer.

So if he can get one, why cant she? Why cant I? Why cant anyone? I havent bombed a hospital, thats gotta be like 10x as peaceful as doing so. 
Mom speaks out after school finds her OnlyFans account and expels her sons: 'It's body shaming and bullying'

Anybody else notice that the dad who "found" this woman's OnlyFans page didn't get his kid expelled, even though he was actively going to an adult nudity site to masturbate, which is a serious no-no in the Catholic Church?
I think the bigger story is she is making 150k a month with only 20-30% of the pics being classy nudes and no pornography.
http://www.reddit.com/r/MrsPoindexter/
And the Christians I know keep wondering why nobody wants to come to their church anymore.
First, what gives them the right to punish a child for the actions of a parent?  Second, if they're so pristine and pure "Christians" what are they doing scrolling through OnlyFans????
Bet her Only fans account is about to get a huge boost in popularity lol.
So, were the kids of the "dad" who found it expelled?  They shouldn't be looking at sites like OnlyFans.
they've been throwing out gay teachers, hiding pedophile priests, trying to take away a woman's right to chose forever.

don't support a medieval organization with your tuition dollars
Making $150k/month, she can start her own private school, with blackjack and hookers.
So did the child of the dad that subscribes to OnlyFans get kicked out too? Or is this another double standard where guys can look but women are the devil for giving them something to look at.
Kinda feel bad for the sons after all this, you just know their friends and classmates have thrown this in their faces.
This mom posts regularly on /r/RealGirls I think.
[deleted]
Why the fuck are you sending your kids to a Catholic School in the first place if you don't hold Catholic ideals?

Why would you want them inculcated into a weird ass sadistic religion which is dead set on harassing and punishing the million and one things they consider deviance? Having gone to Catholic School briefly I can assure you they are the last place you would send a kid if you want them to grow up well adjusted and open minded.

What the school did is 1000% wrong but you can't be in the slightest bit surprised a Catholic School would react that way. Not being publicly ashamed of your body, your sexuality and indeed your very existence is like trying to have a hog roast in your local synagogue - they're going ask you to leave and you probably shouldn't have gone in there in the first place.

I hope she sues them out of existence but really don't fucking patronize them in the first place.
Meanwhile Christians say people unfairly judge them.
You know every dad in the school already knew.  It wasn't until the mom's found out that this happened. Women just hate each other.
The best advertising money can buy.  Now she's world wide.  She probably doubled her income, witch is crazy big anyways.
I didn’t get expelled for my mom being a crack head. It would have been safer and probably more income if she sold nudes online. You even pay taxes on OF income, but definitely not on drugs! Im sure this school district will reverse this since the mom did nothing wrong and a lawyer will rip this apart.

Also, nothing about the dads shopping around on Onlyfans? Just attack the content creator and not the husbands who clearly consume the content without issue. But won’t SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN!
The school should stay tf put of the family's private lives. Wtf
It's funny how so many Catholic/religion based schools have these codes of conduct. But behind closed doors, there is a ton of infidelity, drug and alcohol abuse, spousal abuse, etc.  It's all good until it's made public. Then it's out the door you go because how dare you make the church look bad. The church can do that all by itself, thank you.
Besides the heavily sexist, oppressive misogyny involved, and the self-objectifying-commoditization; why were the kids punished by being expelled from their school?

Were school authorities attempting to humiliate its (now, former-) students, while simultaneously disrupting timely fulfillment of their educational rights and requirements?

Is the school district aware that expulsion has to be a result of examination grounded in legally-defined terms and circumstances? 

Is it just that authority figures find it fun to put down women and children? Is that the long and short of it?
Well after this publicity I hope she can privately school them! Lol
In the late 90s or early 2000s, a kid who I went to high school with's mom's naked pics ended up online. That dude had to see his mom naked CONSTANTLY for years. She was hot as fuck too, so he knew everyone was cranking one out to her too.
"Oh my god, that's terrible!  Where?"
Probably best for the sons, I know she is allowed to do what she wants but that's going to have consequences for her sons no matter where they move to. I'm not taking either side. Just stating that kids can be fucking brutal and school systems can be fucking stupid.
Gee private religious school being intolerant.  Who could imagine.
It's interesting to see this kinda stuff, growing up in a generational Christian family I find it interesting that the church is becoming what Christ and the people who founded this nation fought against. Christianity in all forms is now more about selling salvation vs helping people and living Christ's example. Jesus flipped the tables of vendors at the temple because they sold animals for sacrifice and he wanted to make a statement that you can't buy your way. Now days we are sold "the word of God" and worship music instead of being kind, merciful and forgiving. We sit in buildings that are locked against theft from those who need help, shelter or clothes. 

I know not all are like this as many independent churches act more like food banks and shelters but those are hard to find and ignored by the christian industry.
Fire the administrator who found this and/or expel the kid whose parent found this.
I bought her onlyfans recently. After a few days I've already turned off renewal. She has this weird character she plays like a soccer mom on Facebook with occasional titty pics. Not great
It's her right, but omg I'd die of embarrassment if my mom did that
Expelling the student for the moms hobby/job? What the fuck
It's a catholic school. Why would you send your children there?

They're a bunch of retarded superstitious fucking kiddy diddler sympathizers. Also, hypocrites of the highest caliber.
"It's body shaming and bullying" yup! And unless her children are suffering/hurt/in danger its also none of their fucking business what she does
I'm really confused as to why anyone would put their kids in the care of an organization that clearly thinks raping children is fine.
Prudes are prudish. This is a shame.
All the other moms are mad that she's sexy and confident and has found a way to make money. Also, I'm sure they're upset that every one of their husbands has looked at the OF page for, uh, research.
This is bad but that kid would have been bullied to high hell
Catholic priests rape children. For centuries.

“In 1633, the Inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church forced Galileo Galilei, one of the founders of modern science, to recant his theory that the Earth moves around the Sun.”

Are we surprised??
If this was a public school then it would be one thing... However from the sounds of it, it's a private school. Private schools boot people for all kinds of arbitrary reasons all the time.
I think the real question is how did the pure souls find the OnlyFans account? Quality assurance research? Hmmm 🧐

I do wonder how much her sales have gone up this month because of these articles
The big question for me is "Are they censuring the folks who found her profile?". After all they were there to browse and explore sexual topics too.
I hate stories like this because they always come across, to me, as somebody basically having a moment of "I didn't think the people I associate with who are preachy and judgmental to *everybody else* would be preachy and judgmental to ME!"

I mean, it's not like private religious schools have made much of an attempt at being open-minded, fair, and representative of the supposedly "good" tenets they preach. They routinely discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, they shame women for being female, and many of them still discriminate on the basis of race, mostly I directly, but in some cases overtly.

If you don't want to run the risk of being unfairly judged by bigots, don't associate with judgmental bigots to begin with.
It's a private school, they're under no obligation to find sex work acceptable for a parent of a student.
Best whore
1. Do these kids even want to be in catholic school?
2. How do THEY feel about their mom having an only fans? 

I just see adults arguing and ignoring the children... 🤷🏽‍♂️
Everyone feels bad for the kids because they got kicked out of school and that the parents did nothing wrong.

And it does suck that they have to suffer because of it.

But what no one seems to care about when it comes to their welfare is how utterly *embarrassing it is to know there are nude pics of your mom on the Internet, and that all of your fucking friends can see them, and how this will haunt you until you finish fucking high school.*

No, everyone wants to defend the mom and criticize the school. But I haven't read one comment that suggests the mother is selfish as fuck and didn't think about how this would ultimately affect her sons. I mean, forget getting expelled from their school...What about the bullying they are sure to endure for who knows how long? Because mommy wanted to feel sexy again. Lol
[deleted]
I’m not sure what the laws in California are but in some states doing something like that what those moms did sending out those packets of photos is actually illegal and they could face civil charges if not prison.
I’d say the school officials are probably over on her page whacking off furiously, but I don’t think she’s boyish enough for their tastes.
Better off being expelled from the cult now instead of indoctrination later.
Thats disgusting, where? What is this disgusting womans handle?
Goddamn, i KNEW who it would be.
It’s her private life and she’s hot. So why the hate?
Welcome to religion. You’d think with all the history of religion and sex they wouldn’t be surprised yet here were are “in 2021” and people are still surprised that religion is kinda shitty.
I stopped caring as soon as they said catholic school
$150k/month? Who's paying for this?
The article says she's pulling down $150k/month. Fuck me...why can't I figure some shit out and make like 10% of that?
Honestly if my mom or dad or brother or sister was in porn I wouldn’t care, if actually be more curious how the hell that happened it seemed like it would make for a good story. HOWEVER if I was in school and it got me expelled and odds are my teachers/friends were calling any of my own a slut...I’d hire a mariachi band to follow my teachers EVERYWHERE. For a week. Then the school board. Until I get back in school. Once that’s done I’m getting those sum bitches fired through civil causes. After that idk I’d just hire a mariachi band for every-time a friend or kid called my mom a slut in front of me to follow them after school until like 12:00AM. Then my revenge would be sweet and my salsa cold.

TL;DR

Support your mariachi fellows.
And the guy(s?) Who found out where what, asking for directions away from OnlyFans? Sure principal Skinner, sure.
It's not body shaming it's just stupidity and jealousy
“MILF speaks out after school finds her...”

There, I fixed it. You’re welcome, Stifler.
It’s also funny that the priests are jacking off to her OF  and fantasizing about anal sex with her sons.
Fuck you entitled  religious  white knights any anyone else who can’t mind their own business because of jealousy. Why can’t people learn to maintain their own grind and worry about themselves. Would be a much better place with more kindness and self-care.
It’s because the wife probably found it. And threatened divorce.
Religious fuck wits take it out on children because one of them was caught looking at her Fansonly site.
Up to $150,000 a month!?!  Wow!
Interesting question. Can a religious school expel students because the mother is a pornstar? This one could spark some legal debates
It's her business what she's doing, it's her own fucking business. Her kids education must have nothing to do with it and the school should not be allowed to act like that. 

Period.

Edit and btw: That woman is ***sexy***.
The kids have zero to do with their parents choices, all I can assume is these Moms who wanted them expelled were wanting to stop any potential encounter this woman could have had with their husbands at pick up. There is no reason these boys should have ever been impacted.
So are they expelling the children of the parents who viewed the porn? No? Only the woman who created it gets punished? 

Fucking Catholics. It took me years to overcome the bullshit programming they brainwashed me with in childhood. God is a disease.
Her sons did nothing to deserve this punishment. Catholic bullying....been going strong for 17 centuries
She is suddenly shocked by the norms of the society in which she has lived her entire life.
From a different thread about this-

In some of these posts she wore the school’s logo, and even what appears to be the uniform, in suggestive ways. She jokes/implies having sexual relations with her son’s friends (who are 12) and shared a fictional pornographic story (written by someone else) about having sex with one of the school’s students (this is a grade school). She also publicly shared sexual fantasies in which she mentions teachers at the school by name. She frequently posted photos of herself naked or nearly naked, with her nipples visible, with captions posted about things involving children, like swim team sleepovers, or being sent by the child's mom to pick them up and that they could trust her.

And if this was what she was posting publicly, for anyone to see with little-to-no effort involved to find it, what was she posting on her OnlyFans site, which she herself has said is much more racy, that also involved using the school logo and/or underage sex fantasies?

Imagine the genders were swapped, and a male parent was posting pictures of himself naked, along with fantasies about having sex with minor children at his children's school, online, easily available for anyone to find with a two second Google search. Would you allow a man to run away with the narrative that he's a victim being bullied by other parents? What she is posting literally violates virtually any school's safe environment standards.

Furthermore, in videos she's posted, she also has joked about engaging in prostitution with dads at the school.”
Religion is a disease.  We don't live in a theocracy you lunatics.  If Jesus was real and came down to Earth and saw the state of his religion he'd be ashamed of it 100%.  Wake up and smell your cognitive dissonance.
If you’d expect anything different from a religion organization, you haven’t been paying attention.
Me: I bet it was a catholic school.

wow .. how not fair
What do you expect from a Christian church? Not compation.
Shocking it’s a free society allegedly
How Christian of them.
Damn it Mrs Botwin.... now how’s Shane going to get an education.
Here’s how it went down. 

Dean: *fap fap fap* oh baby I got some junk food for your school lunch *fap fap fap* no sugary drinks.... how about naturally pineapple sweetened *fap fap fap* 

Celia : Dean, what the fuxk are you doing to yourself.... *gasp* is that Nancy?! 

Dean: No uh honey, uh, lil junior found it and I was ah documenting it for the PTA... gotta stop this indecent show.... 

Celia: well then you had better March this smut right into the office come Monday. 

Dean: mondays Memorial Day... 

Later at the BBQ

Celia: ladies you won’t believe what I found dean doing on the puter...

Ladies : cacophony of “oh yeah, Jim too... that slut Nancy... I wish I looked like that after 3 kids... we gotta get her.... 

Tuesday at school: 

Dean: I need to report .... *a crime*! Gasp!
The school saving her kid the embarrassment
The Church visited the inequity of the mothers upon their children, eh?
That’s pretty fucked but to be fair if she/they “earn as much as $150,000 per month for “pretty tame” posts on their account.” then just sign the kid up at another damn school. They probably wouldn’t want their kids at that school once the OF was known anyway. I mean can you imagine those awkward parent teacher conferences, sports games? 

(Post script edit: In retrospect i bet this turns them on)

I’m not saying don’t  “report shame” them into oblivion via the Internet, definitely do that because... why not,  but they shouldn’t act like this minor inconvenience is going to ruin their kids life. 
They’re likely richer for it. This article and the copypasta ones everywhere else are prolly getting them a shit ton of traffic. 

Fuck,  i may do this to myself as a marketing campaign.
Links to her account? Think she could use the support...
Well a catholic school probably has a written policy on various behaviors that she violated so… anyway she’s got plenty of money for another school and the counseling her kids will need later on, after living in that house.
I might be crazy but I've come to believe these "outings" are planned by the moms. It's as if it's a money grab and a great way to get press and perverts to signup for their only fans pages.
Honestly only fans women should never have children mostly because shit like this will happen Kids are mean and so are teenagers it happens.
All her pics are extremely mild! And fun!  And if I looked that good in the stuff she’s wearing I’d be posting, too!!
So she gave up?? Also.. if she has questionable content posted, why wasn't the dad asked why he was there and also punished?
Hmmm it's almost like they are Republicans
Her kids are gonna be harassed for this forever.

What was she thinking?
$150,000.00 a month should buy you a lot of redemption.
That seems illegal but okay
 150000$/month! I been doing it all wrong.
Okay, but how did he know? Bc I feel like that’s grounds for suspending his kids too, no?
Maybe if they paid teachers a living wage, they wouldn’t have to find alternatives…
Never underestimate the power of sexually repressed karens
any video of her? for research porpuses.
How is it a community based around absolute moral code, is somehow one of the more toxic communities (not all, just a lot)
What's one got to do with the other, how ludicrous and how did they find this out in the first instance?🙄
What’s her only fans? I want to help out.
Interesting tactic. Uses this to market her profitable online business and gets to afford a private tutor to homeschool the kids. An all-round win-win. The wives of the male parents at home don’t have to worry about what their husbands know, she makes a packet additional through curiosity-effect.
You can't have it both ways. Either you wanna be a sex object or not.  Own it  and move on or donate a room or books to the school. Lol. , but don't make an  excuse or try to justify when people complain. You know sex sells and stop degrading women to justify your reason. Many women for ages have gotten over menopause without an excuse. You shared with the world not just you husband. What a lame excuse.
Private Catholic school, they can do whatever they want. She knew the risks.
People in glass houses comes to mind.Making a legitimate living from a very innocent activity does not warrant such action towards children.Two points to consider,its not drug or people trafficking,just photos,dont look if you are offended by it.Secondly,here in the U.K we dont have the problems with school shootings to the same degree as elsewhere and l would be more concerned about that problem than a few very innocuous photos and stories.Only another viewpoint.
I might be in the minority here, but their expulsion was a good call. Can you imagine the bullying her sons would receive once the whole school knows what the mother is doing?

I grew up in the MW2 lobby era. It was full of your mom jokes that we all knew was full of shit. I can't imagine how hurtful it is to the sons if their classmates actually have onlyfans images of the mother and started mocking the sons about it.  

If the kids weren't going to be expelled they might leave due to relentless bullying.
The EX first "lady" started her career in America selling nudes. The GOP avoided all mention of that for six years. What's up with this double standard. All these fake lying conservative types are totally going to burn in hell.
Btw, this article talks of body shaming and bullying.  I wasn’t talking about the school.  It was a small cadre of mean moms that could not keep their shit together, so I had the media write a piece on this.  It was perceived as the school was shaming me and that wasn’t true.  But they got caught in the crossfire and thrown under the bus and kicked our family out as it became too disruptive to normal business operations - that makes sense

The next media will review the Karen at the center of all this, they’re working on it.  It’ll be more clear.  (But to the schools fault, they should not listen to The Karen - she’s crazy and will drive you over a cliff, and well, she did)
IT's certainly not body-shaming.  It's about having a porn-star parent at a religious school.
OnlyFans? DISGUSTING. Can someone provide the link so I can make sure to avoid it?
I would expel myself if the school knew about my mom's onlyfans
haha I just realized she lives in my neighborhood...sucks that other moms are dragging her down after she's doing what makes her feel sexy post menopause
Poor kids though, imagine your mom having a fucking onlyfans.
[deleted]
Gunnar need to do some research on this.
Welp, I know what I'm smackin' it to tonight. That woman is fucking beautiful.
> the school recently informed the Jacksons that their sons were no longer welcome at Sacred Heart Parish, writing, “Your apparent quest for high profile controversy in support of your adult website is in direct conflict with what we hope to impart to our students.”

She ain't the one stirring up controversy; she's not the one mailing anonymous packets of porn to the principal; she's certainly not the dad who's browsing OnlyFans (gosh, hope his kids aren't expelled!!)

Ah, Catholicism. The gift that keeps on shitting.
150,00 a month? Did I read that right?? For risque photos an sexy stories lol I wish I could do something like that but I have absolutely no self confidence or any of that. Wish I could pretend for a month b  14000 would be all I need to get out of the incredibly shit situation I'm in.
If she found out another mom was doing onlyfans...she would NOT speak up in her defense...I guarantee it
If she’s making 150,000 a month move the fuck on to somewhere that doesn’t give a shit lol.
As a private school/church, they have the right to be complete assholes and (hopefully) suffer the consequences of their actions.
I immediately wonder how they found the onlyfans. Also how can you punish them for what their mother does??
Holy, she makes 150k a month??
Something something private company
....how’d they find it.
Sorry, l meant hell not help,another senior moment.
They should just take their money somewhere else. If they are open minded enough to have an OnlyFans, why would they even want to have their kids in a stupid catholic school anyway?
Thank you for your kind words but for possibly helping,even at this late stage in my continued development as l pass through this world.Peace to you and yours
No one should punish children because their disagreement with the parents.
I rubbed a few out to her. That situation sucks, probably a bunch of dumpy Karen’s drinking haterade.
Why is the school looking at pelicans and not teaching kids. Fire the school officals.
More power to this woman! And screw the jealous bitches.
I don’t know why people are upset about this. I guarantee it was a kid that found it and not a parent. Once it’s out there in the school that’s all the kids would be talking about for a month straight.

If I was her son I would be livid for embarrassing me and getting me kicked out of my school.

I don’t know how she thought doing this would be a good idea, and also enrolling her son in a catholic school 🤦🏻‍♂️
Seems to be a clear violation of civil statutes in most jurisdictions, if not Federally Guaranteed Rights!
I would go through the trash of those parents and spread their private deeds to the public. These women were probably a upset their body changed when they had kids are are jealous of her body.
God works in mysterious ways 🙏
Uh, no, it’s more fundamental than that. There is simply no (legal) reason to do this, period. It’s totally bullshit that they can get away with this kind of shit because they are a “religious organization”. If any other organization did this, they would be FUCKED.
Looked 👀 All pg13 stuff. It is their right..... But it's also their wrong....
If you are sending your kids to catholic school. There are immediate strings attached to it. They have a centuries long track record of biased shit.

This isn't  body shaming. This an entitled parent who didn't use common sense.
Catholic School, case closed. 

I knew a girl whose mom taught at a Catholic school for 40 years. The daughter started teaching there when she was like 23. Her husband died and she found a new guy, they were dating. They decided to get pregnant but the girl didn't want to marry him because of her deceased husband. 

School fired her, nothing anyone could do.
It is a private school with different standards.   Her stance seems to be that it's between her and her husband, however,  since she publicly posted the photos it's no longer  between her and her husband.  Who's looking into the parent who found the account?  Neither side is 100% in the right.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
How does one “find” a website unless they are a member?
I think Christianity might be the only thing hated on more than Trump on Reddit.
Bad publicity is still publicity.
Dude it's a catholic school, of course they did. What did they expect would happen?
r/leopardsatemyface
If she signed a waiver, like many Christian schools in general would have you do, then there is no reason for her to even try and appeal it. 

It is legally enforceable. However, depending on how the guy found it, if there was no strict rule against that, then he shouldn't be in any trouble. If there was an agreement within the waiver, then his kids should get similar punishment.
Women are evil to each other
School just made these kids rich
But how did they “find it” hmmmm
First I was on her side.  Then I switched to their side when I read it was a Catholic school.  Then I switched back to her side when I read a parent found the pictures and it seemed like that wasn't an equal sin. 

Still, their little demons will not be contaminated by going to school with a porn star's children.
she belongs to the skreeets
Good. Those kids are lucky this all came out. It’s so dangerous for kids to be exposed to that kind of immoral and dangerous messaging every day, the kids will be in a much better place now that this has all gone down.
Hopefully they’ll be able to enroll is a nice public school, or with that kind of money rolling around, a high class liberal private school where no one cares what their milf mom does in her bedroom.
I can’t believe people would send their children to a religious school for indoctrination these days.
Take your money and put your kids in an even more elite private boarding school then? i'm sure one of them will take your money
Social shaming is a VERY important part of society if we ever hope to have any semblance of morality.
Not the point of the article *at all*, and I apologize profusely, but mom is a fucking smokeshow.
What does HER page have to do with her child? And whats the school,  doing on onlyfans???
Guess her kids could sue, maybe she could too. Seems in most states the church is now behaving more like a real legally responsible entity... or is it the school contract that needs fixing?
It’s neither, it’s just stupid, it’s like suspending a child from school because their parents just shot someone down the hall, because they can’t control that. Only difference is the onlyfans doesn’t negatively affect someone
Why were they searching for her onlyfans?
$150,000 per month?  Holy Mother of Pearl!  Sorry, I’d say I’m stunned about the kids getting kicked out, but I’m not. However, with that type of income, maybe she’ll find a better place for them.
Now every kid in that school is googling her and they made an even bigger problem that never was one.
150 grand a month? Holy shit
Ok all seriousness, would the kids have even WANTED to stay at that school? Kids are vicious creatures no matter what religion their school is. They would’ve been bullied relentlessly
On one hand I am against the witch hunt and the punishing of the kids but why would this woman put herself in this position. I think people have the right to do what they want but be realistic about the consequences and who they might impact.
I need to do research on this topic. What is her name??
I mean.....would you really want to stay at the school after everyone knows you mom has an onlyfans
Shit im about to do my part in helping by subscribing to her onlyfans. Its the right thing to do
I feel sorry for the kids as they grow up, whatever school they end up in. They are going to get bullied hard about all the nude content of their mum online.
Even bad publicity is good publicity. Her subs are gonna go through the roof now.
[deleted]
With that income though, both parents can quit their jobs and send all 3 kids to a rich school, where money is more important than chastity.
Gotta say, where are repercussions for the man who found her account? If what she did was so deplorable, him consuming that material should be equally deplorable, and his family should also be expelled.
probably best for the kids to be away from that indoctrination anyway
Based off of how the other moms acted, it sounds like they didn't find out about the OnlyFans page in the same way as their husbands did...
Religion makes people do horrible things
Beyoncé's "Support and Empower Women" clothing range is made by women sweat shop labourers working hard on less than £ 0.44 per hour

Made by women for women!  Plus the women they hired were paid the same as the male children they could have hired instead.  
Perhaps those workers need to make some 'Lemonade', they seem to have plenty of lemons when life gives them 0.44 per hour...
I'm simply impressed that this article came out three weeks ago and I'm only hearing about this now. 

Either her PR is fantastic or no other news organization/person wants to make mention of this. 
Coming soon: Jay-Z's "stop world hunger"  clothing line. Made by kids who are starving to death
Not only are people being paid sweatshop wages, but women are scared and uncomfortable about having to shower together with men in open shower blocks? WTF Beyonce?

Beyonce has millions of dollars and sells her leggings for £100 each while paying 44cents for production? Company motto should be "Empowering women. Except poor women. Fuck those people."
It's not that difficult to establish a US-side supply chain that treats its textile workers even decently; the profit margin would shrink but it would still be less than the sticker price especially with tax breaks.
Serious question: something I often see in defence of these practises is that they're actually helping people in impoverished countries because without their sweatshops, these people would have no work at all. What confuses me about that is why it isn't possible to provide employment without the conditions being so shitty? I get companies will always want to save as much money as possible, but is it not reasonable to expect them to set up factories in these countries - since the cost of living there means the wages can be less than in, say, the US or the UK - but not pay them so little and have them working in such horrible conditions? 

I guess what I'm asking is why some people talk like there are only two options - sweatshops or starvation? Is there not a middle ground or am I missing something? 
When we *freed the slaves* we didn't end slavery, we moved it to other countries.
 It's a typo, it should read "Support and Empower Woman". Beyonce being the woman in question.
Support and empower ~~women~~ me
Daily reminder:

Another example of rich people using gender war to distract poor people while they steal their shit
beyonce be getting that blood money! gotta have those 100k earrings, beyonce dont wear no 25k earrings. http://i.imgur.com/qcXqKku.jpg
Did anyone really expect anything else?
These people are so fucked up. 
most hip-hop artists are absolute frauds - they care about nothing but trading on black ghetto stereotypes to make money ... that's why when rap turned gangsta in the late 80s the civil rights leaders hated it and fought it 

... then rap, now 'hip-hop' caught on to the point it became an industry that made money so the elders pretty much got quiet - but the debasement and dumbing-down of black culture continued unabated for over 20 years+

You can hardly find anyone under 55 who knows anything about politics or has been a leader of any important issue - especially in the black community ... in black popular culture it has become about ostentatious displays of wealth, petty place-seeking, projecting some image and money-grubbing

Jay-Z and Beyonce are complete phonies when it comes to politics or social issues, as much phonies as Leonardo DiCaprio is on the environment
> "Support and Empower Women"

I've seen this before...

http://i.imgur.com/OMg4vmm.png
I'm sure she has convinced herself it is not her fault and not her problem.
.44/hour!??  
  
DAMN these celebrities always raising the cost of doing business.
Offbeat? Fucking disgraceful. 
Support and Empower Women = SEW 

Seems intentional.
Has a celebrity ever had a clothing or apparel company that wasn't based in overseas sweatshops? Has a celebrity ever acknowledged they knew about it when it was exposed? I've seen it  countless times where they act shocked, but I've never heard of an ethical brand of clothing/apparel started by a celebrity that really had experience in those industries. NEVER. 
Newsflash folks: Beyoncé doesn't do shit besides sing and dance. 

Here whole "creative" and "artistic" persona is 100% bullshit. She doesn't write her own lyrics, produce her own music, choreograph her own dances, etc. 

She is dumber than a paper bag. Have you ever heard her talking when it wasn't telling white teenage girls how nice it is to meet them and how pretty they are?

So if you're going to be upset with something related to Beyoncé, remember she is a brand, not an actual smart human being. And if she replies to something like this with "I was unaware, this must have happened with the people working around me," she is telling the truth. 
That's because the brand of female empowerment that Beyonce pushes is completely superficial and meaningless. 
So you're saying it's a profit thing!?
Beyonce fucks the poor with style.
I'm assuming the marketing team was well aware of the irony, though most likley figured the profits from cheap labor would negate any negative media.

Fans of these "celebs" will buy anything without care for whatever negative press surrounds their merchandise.
Support and empower a woman
To us that is nothing, to the workers that's meals they can take home. I mean it sounds and looks like shit to us, but I'm sure those workers are just happy to be able to work.
It's morally repugnant for her not to acknowledge these protections for workers overseas just because people in many parts of the word feminist spread by idiots.
Well, Beyoncé wouldn't be making much of a profit if she set up a factory in the U.S. now would she? 
*But Beyoncé is so nice, how could we possibly be mad at her? \#modernfemenism and so forth...*
Am I the only one who loathes Beyonce and Jay-Z? I really can't stand their personas and "music" but if you say that in the US, you are racist or don't know music. I loved the SNL skit "The Bagency" or something like that. 
Nothing new.  Western feminists are self-serving hypocrites.  They don't actually care about actual female suffering, they want to create an environment that paints themselves as the victim so they can get the benefits.  
Remember she tried to ban the word "bossy" hahahaha. Stupid cunt. 
And yet those jobs are sought out by a ton of people because it pays better than the alternatives. What's your solution to this issue? Remember, this isn't happening down the street from you, it's happening in countries where people literally starve to death (who aren't old and forgotten or raised by horrible parents).

TIL westerners have no idea how much of the world lives.
TIL woman can choose to be employed for market rates
I'm sure that Beyonce wouldn't have stood for this had she known the conditions of these sweat shops, but even so a little research on her part would have done a world of good.
>A 22-year-old sewing machine operator told the Sun her 18,500 rupee (£87.26) monthly salary is not enough to survive on. She works shifts of almost ten hours Monday to Friday with just a half hour lunchbreak and also works overtime and on Saturdays.

Hate to sound insensitive but a person working those same hours at minimum wage in the US would find it hard to survive, also. Things are tough all over.


She's the Queen though right? Of course she'll claim ignorance but fuck her.
You see this, ladies?  This is your role model!
Western feminism in action.
I swear, every time
Poetic injustice.
Hey, That's $1 american dollar per hour, EMPOWERMENT!
Is there any celebrity with a product line not paying very low wages to its manufacturers?
how likely is it that Beyonce negotiated the specifics of choosing Sri Lanka as her manufacturing locale? not likely. the issue is that she probably never asked. if you start asking where your clothes are made you won't like the results. spoiler: it's probably not a happy place. buy American when you can, or buy your clothes used off ebay, it's damn cheap and the selection is huge.

Let's see a show of hands to see who is surprised, so we can laugh at them.
Humanity as long as she makes a profit she would say anything
Always knew she was a creep like the rest of sociopathic rich people ^^ 
If you look at the producing and writing credits for Beyoncé's song Run The World (Girls), it's mostly men. It's almost like she's not really a feminist, and just does what will make $$$$.
What part of this story is supposed to be offbeat, OP?
And this surprises anyone because...?
That means nothing without context. How much is the average wage for a similar job in those countries? Often times making what seems to be a small amount of money for us is actually way better than other companies in the area and sure as hell beats unemployment 
This all stems from a typo.  The news is outraged that it was meant to "inspire and support *women*" when the ad agency meant to use the singular "inspire and support *woman*", as in Beyonce specifically.
She is one of the worst celebrity "activists" I have ever seen in my life.
The fuck has Beyonce done for women or anybody for that matter? Why is she regarded as this feminist hero? Honest question
all my singles, ladies.
Fucking hypocrites. .
Hypocrisy!
man I feel bad for women that bought those shirts not realizing it was built because Beyonce felt like pandering to them.
She's the Kathy Lee of this generation.
Stupid name. Stupid woman. She can't even make decent music, let alone clothes.

George Orwell's 1984 Is Now the #1 Bestselling Book on Amazon

Go read it for free here. http://www.george-orwell.org/1984.
I'm posting this here in case no one has seen it yet:

http://i.imgur.com/2H8gZq5.jpg
It was *always* the bestselling book on amazon...
[deleted]
Just to clarify, it is not an instruction manual.
The second best part about this is that the book is public domain around the world... *except for in the US*. It had been public domain, but the US government retroactively pulled it back into copyright in 2009.

The ***best*** part about this is that back in 2009, Amazon literally dropped this book down the memory hole, and [remotely and silently removed the book from people's Kindles without warning](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/07/amazon-sold-pirated-books-raided-some-kindles/).

And people are ***still*** giving Amazon money for it!
They really would benefit from reading A Brave New World. That is more along the lines of what has been occurring over the last 20 years or so. 
That book is depressing. But then again, so is reality.
Doubleplusgood 
George Bush created this surveillance state, Obama expanded it, only time will tell what Trump will do
Another generation of adults buy book they were supposed to read in high school but didn't.
It was also very popular when the Tea Party movement started up. Granted that was when the Tea Party was more of a libertarian movement than whatever the hell it turned into.
What a great president, he's already getting Americans to read more books!
Every presidency has a moment when this book becomes the most popular book. Remember when Obama gave the NSA the ability to spy on every digital communication of every American without warrant? Became the most popular book then as well.
A few years too late.
I bought it Christmas time and it was #1 then
We're people on another planet for the last 8 years?
Is it a sign of the new Trump Administration or the start of the new semester and quarters for colleges or both?

The trouble is that Nineteen Eighty-Four was essentially true in the year 1984.  That was more than 30 years ago, and the wheels of government intrusion and surveillance, duplicity, rewriting of history and the reduction of complex ideas to substance-less sound bites has continued unabated.

Think about it.  30 years ago there were a lot of newspapers, magazines, etc.  Now we have Twitter.

NOW? Now you educate yourselves on the possible outcome if you vote for him? I'd say better late than never but I do not know if that is true anymore.
Only because of all of the illegal sales.  If it wasnt for that, 'DJT: The Best Autobiography, Everyone Says So' would have easily been the #1 seller.
Number 1 song at the inauguration - "tonight we're gonna party like it's 1984"
"Amusing Ourselves to Death" is also quite good. 
Nothing like opposing something by doing the same thing as everyone else at once. 
Yes, 1984 is currently a best seller just like A Brave New World is.
This happens at the beginning of every Semester when books like these - the High School & College - Classics become required reading.
This is also a repost as it often is every Semester but I forgot who they attributed the rise in sales last time. 
Why?  Hasn't everyone already read it?
War is peace, slavery is freedom, ignorance is strength.

Has anyone else read We by Yevgeny Zamyatin?
- 1984 was about Stalinism (leftist government) 

- Brave New World was about progressivism, and rule by experts and technicians (leftist government)

many of the people who are reading these books are gonna completely miss the point. 
So now a president who wants to get the government out of the way and make it smaller the people run out to buy this book.  When a president took 8 years of actual government growth and intrusion into people's private lives no one could be convinced to read this book.  What the fuck is wrong with the world?

Now that someone I don't like is in control I am fearful about the government policies that were already happening!
well not too surprising considering its the new handbook for all US government employees.
This was supposed to be a warning, its turning out to be a manual.
Amazing. I would be so curious read his thoughts on modern politics and Trump. 

Who is our Orwell nowadays?
Funny this should happen today; just bought the Kindle edition couple of hours ago.
I'm wondering, 1984 is a very popular book and has been for some time. What position was it in before Trump Inauguration and "Alternate Facts" comment.
gonna be a lot of people disappointed

Is this all that 'mission accomplished' pent up anger at fake news coming out now? 
Surprised it's not A Confederacy of Dunces.
I would also recommend Animal Farm as well.

My reasons are such that I see a lot of "discourse" online that can be simply shortened to "TWO LEGS BAD! FOUR LEGS GOOD! TWO LEGS BAD! FOUR LEGS GOOD!"  No actual discussion, no appeals to reason, just "YOU LOST! GET OVER IT! SHUT UP!!"
Silly buggers, you should have read it BEFORE the election
Can we do more of this election thing to get more people to read.
Recommend everyone to have a go at if you even aren't a reader. Get it by audio and listen on the drive to work or school. Even in short bursts, it's fun. 

I don't read books outside of school. But started audio books in the car. Really enjoying it and actually went through 1984 a few months ago. Also recommend Animal Farm. 
Ya, I bought one. My high school senior has it as an assignment and we didn't already have it.
It's funny that it took Trump to get people to finally start opening their eyes when it's been happening right in front of them for years now. 
Typical American consumerism, what can I buy to combat this problem I have?
I have read 1985 and Brave New World and really enjoyed both, any book recommendations about dystopian futures similar to these? 
No need to re-read 1984; we're living it!
Why?
Can somebody tell me what kind of book this is?

I've heard of it of course, but is it an essay? Is it a sort of political observation by story telling? Or is it just a very good fictional book? 
This is my favorite book. Glad others will start to enjoy! 
Question: Would it be better to have a hard copy over an audiobook? It may be a stupid question, so I apologize, but I usually do audiobook since I drive a lot and don't have time to sit in a one place and actually read. 
Well, kinda ironic.

>The role of media in the society presented in the novel by George Orwell, 1984 cannot be underestimated nor can the commentary about the possible future in the novel be ignored. One of Orwell’s astute observations about politics and society that forms the axis around which his novel 1984 is tshat the media have an incredible degree of influence with respect to  shaping thought. While the responsibility of journalism, whether in print or electronic format, is to inform the citizens of facts (Kosicki 114), the fact of the matter is that the media are by no means neutral (Cohn 25)
Ordered a copy today 
I wanted to buy this... but amazon is only selling the ENGLISH LEARNING version... dafuq.

Anyone have the actual book version?
Time for a reread
So what I'm getting from this is that the millions of people who only read the sparknotes version in high school, because reading was too much of a chore, now want to understand and make their own tired, cliche comparisons to the book. 
[Christopher Hitchens and George Packer talking Orwell in 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGrLDs8EdCc)
I have a copy. It's good to have a good ole paper book as the batteries last a very long time. 

1984 gives you a great perspective on our society. It's not like the Trump administration has all of the sudden thrust us all into an Orwellian dystopia. We've been living in one for awhile! Something very interesting and Orwellian is how it was expected that Big Brother would take away our right to privacy but in fact with Facebook and our social media obsession, we've given it away. 

Drink your Victory Gin and be thankful that we're winning the war against Eurasia...or was it East Asia?
Just went to Barnes and Noble in Seattle and they're sold out lol
Can someone tell me how we get it reclassified from the fiction to non-fiction categories?

Vegan woman climbs Mt. Everest to prove vegans are not weak - dies of altitude sickness on Mt. everest

[Non daily fail link.](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dutch-australian-climbers-die-after-reaching-everest-summit-n578061)
lots of people die of altitude sickness or exposure on mount everest
Man, fuck that mountain-climbing shit. I'm staying at a respectable 50 ft above sea level. A lot of things can still kill me, but altitude sickness will NOT be one of them, dammit! 
[deleted]
Also, another guy died on that climbing trip. Probably not a vegan.
Pretty tragic but why did she feel the need to "prove vegans can do anything"? That's probably the dumbest cause I've ever heard.
What a distasteful article. Her death is a big joke to the journalist.
>She was an experienced climber who previously conquered Kilimanjaro

That's not really a comparable climb, as I understand it. its more of an arduous trek.

[deleted]
Sad that even if she had made it, it wouldn't have proven anything.

Her being a vegan was immaterial to her dying though, just like the other hundred climbers that lived being omnivores ALSO didn't factor.
What the fuck. They're mocking this person's death. It probably had nothing to do with veganism, at all. I'm a meat eater. I'll try just about anything. And I'll make fun of vegans like the next redditor, but this is kind of bullshit. Everest kills a shit load of people, and it has shit-all to do with their diet. 
The mountain has only recently reopened so my guess is these guys died by not spending enough times at the multiple base camps so that their bodies can acclimatize to the elevation.  
Unless dying of altitude sickness is somehow related to diet, I do not see the point.
Anyone else think it's weird how "sherpas" are referred to in any of these Everest stories? It's almost like they're not even human beings, just things that real people with names use to climb up and down Everest. 
I'm not a vegan. I eat meat like no tomorrow.  

Now we have that out the way, this woman was trained and had plenty of practise from other climbing expeditions. Altitude sickness can hit anyone. Your lifestyle diet hasn't got anything to do with it. 
Mt. Everest kills a shitload of people every year. 

Seriously you go up there now there are bodies left near the trail that because, well, what are you supposed to do? No way to safely helicopter anything in that high. 

Also Sherpas just lead everyone up a very well traveled line. Its something people clearly have done before, people clearly die doing, and there's no polite place to store your shit. 

I suppose I'm just saying that Everest in general is stupid, not veganism. 

Although the belief that being a vegan can bring your enlightened natural powers to the forefront to safely survive at an altitude humans were distinctly not evolved to operate at is silly, and very tragic in this instance.
Fuck every thing about this article.

I know people she taught, she was a great person. The absolute lack of respect from who ever wrote this article. They should go climb Everest their self. 

Here is the headline, "Daily Mail writer dies on Everest, proves hateful bastards are just as fragile as the dead they slander", that's if any one even cares.
The only thing I know about Mt. Everest is to never climb it.
Ironically, if she hadn't died, she most likely would have been a vegetable. 

I'll show myself out....


Pretty sure her diet had nothing to do with death by altitude sickness. That's like bringing up the fact someone was vegan after they get hit by a bus.
Tabloid journalism at its worse.

To be fair, plenty of meat eaters have also met their end there... 
Have to admit I had to chuckle when I read the title but that settled pretty quickly. Climbing the Everest is no walk in the park and a lot of people die trying. 


My heart and thoughts go out to her husband and family. 
she probably knew she was going to be all over the news either she dies or climbs. Vegans lol
Died following her dreams. Sad but a cannot fault her for trying. 
> took on the challenge to prove that 'vegans can do anything'.

But can she do it without telling everyone that she's a vegan?
I'm not even a vegan, but even I think the vegan stereotypes are way overblown.
There is absolutely nothing about being a vegan vs. a meat eater that would make climbing Everest easier or harder.  You barely eat while you're on your summit run because of the way the altitude messes with you, and what you do eat is mostly broth / candy / protein gels (which I'm sure you can find in vegan appropriate forms). 

The things that kill you on Everest are the lack of oxygen, and side effects stemming from that-- you don't starve on the mountain, and being "Strong enough" has little to do with leg/arm strength-- it's actually a fairly easy climb from a technical perspective, apart from the Hillary Step on the south side (which I suspect she was climbing).  Instead, what kills you is your body's ability / inability to survive without enough oxygen.  While you're acclimating, it's common to develop edema's (cerebral being the most dangerous), and while you're on your summit run you're above the 'death zone' for the last 12-18 hours or so, during which time your body will literally start eating itself for food (which is common at altitude-- again why you don't eat much-- you eat yourself).  If you run out of oxygen (typically on your way back down because you spent too long on the top) you die (probably).  If you encounter any issues that make it hard for you to descend the step, you die.  If you are the kind of person who gets addled and loses their ability to make/assess decisions without oxygen, you die.  It's not any more dangerous for a vegan.


TL;DR- 

- Being a vegan has nothing to do with climbing Everest.  

- Meat doesn't make you better at acclimatizing to altitude.

- At high altitude, your body starts eating itself, rather than food.  As such, you're kind of eating yourself, which probably isn't vegan, as you're made of meat.
I don't like to sound like i'm defending veganism, but the mountain doesn't care what you ate when it's gonna kill you.
I'm sure she and every other person who died on Mt. Everest died because of the fact they were VEGANS!
"Reddit fucktard sitting on fat ass at home thinks someone that summitted Everest is weak"
To be fair, a lot of people have died trying to make it to the summit of that mountain whether they were vegan or not. 
**Green** boots
I think altitude sickness can happen to anyone vegan or not. If your body does not properly acclimate to higher elevations and the lack of oxygen, you're going to have a bad time. 
Sad that people make fun of her. Fyi her husband made it and he's vegan too
This is a super fucked up spin on the story, although I appreciate the irony. Dying on Mt Everest only proves the Mt Everest is super dangerous and kills lots of people.
Yeah.. pretty sure her diet had very little to do with her death. Lots of people have attempted that climb and died in the process.
Either way, the sample size in her study is way to small to prove anything.
she ran out of oxygen....most likely due to telling everyone she was a vegan on her way up
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
Being a vegan has absolutely zero effect on how your body deals with altitude sickness.

This article is insinuating ridiculous misinformation.
Undoubtedly her death provides no evidence for or against Vegans' ability to climb a mountain; but I do believe it has provided further evidence that stupid people do stupid things.

(I am not saying that she was stupid for climbing a mountain, but I am saying she was stupid for making veganism her reason).
Stupid article, horrible "journalist", terrible website. Still, it's a stupid thing to die for, I hope she did it for more than just to defend veganism. 
Being Vegan or arrogant probably had nothing to do with death by oxygen deprivation.
Yeah and I eat a shit ton of meat and got altitude sickness at 13000 feet but have done multiple climbs over 15000 and it never bothered me. It's all about acclimation but even then it's still a crap shoot.
I think vegans are perfectly capable of surviving everest.

However unlucky people will die. She was unlucky, may she rest in peace.
A bowl of chicken noodle soup would have fixed her right up.
She soyly will be missed.
It's the Daily Mail, I'd take this article with much more than a pinch of salt.
People are making a lot of horrible jokes and lame puns at this woman's death, which is wrong.  This woman died of altitude sickness which is a horrific way to meat one's demise. 
However, there is no evidence that her diet resulted in her death.
What causes death by altitude sickness? If you bring some oxygen breathing type tanks with you, i just don't understand how it kills you?
Patrik Baboumian already has done this. Former Mr. Universe has done this. Nick and Nate Diaz have have done this. Carl Lewis has done this. Climbing Everest is a tourist attraction build on the backs of the sherpas. We don't need foolish people dying to prove something science already has. Also this article is pretty bad.
Plenty of meat-eaters have died on Everest. This woman showed the world that vegans can die of altitude sickness just like people who eat meat.
why does reddit link to the daily mail!? It's a scaremongering and racist excuse of a news source. About 1/5th of the stories that they run are about food related cancer stories, just [see this song by Russell Howard that lists all the things that the Mail has reported to have caused cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3chJN9DCGg)
I think this bit Sums it up pretty well 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NwVNuyfhF0Q
you guys need to remember that she's just one vegan; her successfully climbing Mt. Everest doesn't mean that all vegans are 'strong' or 'able to do anything' nor does her death means that all vegans are weak, plenty of people vegans or otherwise have died from altitude sickness. 

The only thing we can take from this is that this vegan is dead. 
This title reminds me of the Harley riders that protested New York helmet laws by doing a group ride without their helmets... then one of them went down, bumped his head, and RIP.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/york-rider-dies-protesting-motorcycle-helmet-law/story?id=13993417
It's the most unfortunate way for a vegan to meat her end.
Vegans and vegetarians are subhuman retards 
Ha. 
In the article, there is a neat infographic of the climbing routes taken. Does anybody have a better resolution link?
I've been altitude sick all of one time and never care to repeat it.  It's the freakiest thing to basically have your entire body shut down on you while simultaneously being as nauseated as you will ever be.  Would not recommend it. :-/
How do people die of altitude sickness when they have sufficient oxygen?
I'm no fan of veganism but I'm pretty sure altitude sickness has nothing to do with veganism. OP is guilty of correlation=causation and shall take a 50 yard penalty.

r/nottheonion

So Scott Pilgrim was wrong?
This is The Onion level of tragedy 
> Her husband is **though** to have reached the summit. 

Don't trust the spell checker.
/r/toosoon
If any of you are interested in everest and are on snapchat check out @everestnofilter. Basically 2 pro climbers attempting to summit without oxygen. They've been going up and down for a month and just started their actual summit bid last few days. 
So she just became a permanent Everest resident correct? Too risky for others to bring her back down.

Mythbusters are off the chain these days
I'm sitting on top of Mt. Everest 
While you're standing at the bottom, didn't even make the list.
Sadly it was not VeganGains.
DC liquor stores sell more champagne after Trump loss than on last two New Years combined

[deleted]
With 93% of the vote for Biden, I'm not surprised at all.
Here in the suburbs of Philadelphia most of our liquor stores sold out too.
Here in Texas most were upset. My house partied and I got drunkkkk
People can finally drink and sleep.
Look at all of the records Trump is helping set! The biggest records, the hugest records!
Two bottles for me in NJ.
I got a bottle Friday night. Tasted fantastic.
> Social media videos show sprays in the air as people gathered outside of the white house.

Sounds like *We the People* have chosen champagne over tear gas.
I bought one Saturday! I’ve been hoping it would happen but couldn’t jinx it by buying it early. So happy to pop that bottle open!
I drank two bottles by myself on Saturday. I think that’s the first time in my life I’ve ever actually bought champagne.
I'm not even American and i opened a bottle.
I'm from then uk and I definitely had a drink and let some fireworks off to celebrate with my American friends
The deep state celebrates.....
Chalk my crew up for 7 in NYC
We bought Trump blanc de blanc and cheers'd his defeat with it. What better irony? Also, he might need the money here soon
Watched a guy walk out with about 3 cases of champagne while I went to get stuff myself lol.
I had my first bottle in decades!
The real question is, was it because of Trump's loss, *or Biden's win?*
I hate that I live in a red area. I wanted to run into the streets and celebrate en masse, too. I still celebrated like a motherfucker with my husband, though!
Gotta stimulate the economy yo.
True trickle down economics on every sense.
It was a great day to pop champagne
I guess you could say that Trump's loss has been the best thing to happen to the economy in 4 years
Going to be selling a record amount of toilet paper pretty soon.
So this is how a Liberal echo chamber looks like..... Interesting
The one by me did as well
This seems very on beat.
We sold alot at my store in MN also.
Just came here. I can’t stop laughing after seeing all the posts here. You guys are awesome. Thump up to everyone of you.
We bought two bottles before the inauguration and the salesman was so excited we though he assumed we got engaged. Similar excitement levels for me tho.
Hangovers intensify
He’s such a giant LOSER. Fired from his first job. Pathetic. Sad.
We and our neighbors went through four bottles. 🥂🇺🇸🗽🦅🇺🇸
Overthrowing a fascist Mussoliniesq dicktator we drink champagne in the streets.... What would those qanon fuckers have done if cheeto face won?
I'll drink many and keep the bottles just in case I need them..
I smoked weed.
😂 and this is coming from a city that pops Moët and Cliqout like it’s water. They musta went nba finals win locker room out there.
Holy shit liquor store sell champagne cuz the dumb smelly orange man lost haha get rekt nazi
Fox News: GOP stimulates champagne industry by resisting congressional blue wave

(Seriously, they had a similar headline after stocks rose in response to the world’s biggest market uncertainty being voted out of office)
....After Trumps loss, or after Biden’s win?
Says DC but pretty sure it was a country wide champagne sell out
Wait...he hasn't lost yet though. Those people are gonna be real upset when they realize Biden isn't going to be the next president...
Don’t celebrate early.
Causation or correla.....ah nevermind. We know.
No bottles for me, no celebration having Biden and Kamala.
No shock that the aristocracy would celebrate making corruption great again. ::raspberry noises::
Fantstic
I would love to tell everyone how many bottles of Champaign I drank...but my recollection (for some unknown reason) is a little fuzzy. We’ll say that I did my part.
THEY WERE CELEBRATING TRUMP'S DECISIVE, LANDSLIDE (BOTH POPULAR AND ELECTORAL) VICTORY WHICH WE WILL SEE ONCE ONLY THE LEGAL VOTES ARE COUNTED! 

\-Trumpkins, probably
This is great. but there is still a pandemic going on so bars are probably still at limited capacity. Many ppl who would've hit up a bar having to drink at home probably also contributed to this.
[removed]
I’m as psyched as anyone about this but it’s more likely the same amount of alcohol being consumed, just the bars are closed, right?
I guess covid is over now that Trump lost right? Yay house parties
[deleted]
LOL alcoholics sure do love alcohol LOL
Libs love their riot juice
And if Trump had won, they would have looted all the champagne.
Celebrating a political victory like this means your a loser
No riots.  I guess because the democrats didn't lose.
Yea and they drank champagne when they found out there murder rates went up 😀
Shows what type of people vote for that fool
LAPD officer killed during training exercise was reportedly investigating cops accused of gang rape

Did everyone forget that the LAPD is possibly the most corrupt police force in America?
>The name of one of the officers accused of rape "seems to correlate with one of the officers that was at the bicycle training," said Gage, alleging that the officer in question was the one who hurt Tipping.  
>  
>Gage could not confirm that the officer accused of rape was the officer directly engaged in the training exercise with Tipping. But he said "our investigation indicates that yes, it was." He added that the LAPD said no video footage of the training exercise exists, even though these sorts of trainings are often recorded.

Dude was definitely murdered.
This is why there are vanishingly few "good" cops. If you're a decent person, best you're gonna get is fired, worst is fucking murdered by your psycho coworkers.
100% murder. The usually recorded bit is the nail in the coffin.
If these are just bad apples then the good cops in the unit will take care of these murderers. Oh wait...
Where's a Chris Dorner when you need him?
There goes one of them good cops.
This is episode 1 of The Shield right here...
The few good apples always seem to get chased out or murdered.
So cops get qualified immunity even when they kill another cop?
Unsurprised Pikachu
It goes to show that if you don’t let cops rape with impunity, the odds are they’ll murder you.
“Let no good deed go unpunished.”
~ LAPD
I’ve been working on explaining ACAB to my parents, because my mom will insist there must be SOME good cops, every single person who joins the police can’t possibly ALL be bad. But then I’ll point to cases like this, where there actually was a “good” cop and the other cops murdered him. The system makes sure that all cops are bad, because it weeds out any that are good
This is one of the very few times I've ever felt genuinely sad to hear about a cop getting killed. RIP brave soul.
Seems to be a lack of conservatives coming and saying "well then go sign up and change it from the inside.."  almost as if they know this is the result every time.
What a sad coincidence... just a coincidence. That's all. * Nervous laughter *
So "offbeat" means "something everyone expected to happen and is not surprised by in the least"?
Smh. They killed him to to let all other cops know what will happen if they don’t get in line with their criminal activities. Even had nerve enough to go to this man’s funeral. 

Never forget, LAPD is one of the biggest gangs in the world.
This wasn’t a “wrongful death” this was a murder
Snitches get ditches.
Hmm. Not suspicious at all is it?
This is why there are no “good” cops. You be a bastard along with everyone else or let your conscience show and get murdered knowing your killers will never be punished.
ACAB
This is why people say there aren't good cops.
This is another reason why cops shouldn't investigate themselves.
Killing him was the departments way of saying they found no wrongdoing
They don't call it a brotherhood for nothing. Cops who speak up, usually have their call for backup conveniently never show up or arrive too late.
This certainly binds the cheese.
No good cop left alive
same ol story: pigs killin' pigs.
Sorry, bruh.  Nothing personal, just business
Nothing to see here
Just a gang murdering someone investigating their crime.
Love how this is in r/offbeat likes it’s a quirky human-interest story about lovable, goofy cops and their hilarious hi jinx. Is there a “this is some serious shit” subreddit that this can go in?
Another tragic gang killing.
Yeah…not sure how this happens during a grappling exercise…

>	Gage claims that Tipping wound up with three broken ribs, a lacerated liver, head injuries, and a broken neck. "His heart eventually stopped working because of his injuries" and "he was paralyzed….He had subdural hematomas at three places on the left side and three places on the right side. There is no way that grappling would have caused those injuries the way the LAPD portrayed it."
It’s not  just a few bad apples, it’s actually a few good apples on a rotten tree.
So when I was at school, I heard that "one bad apple spoils the whole bunch"

They failed to mentioned that they good apples were all killed.
LAPD needs to be completely wiped

This cop was straight up murdered.
All because he wouldn't look the other way really. 

More integrity than any of those fuckers. I feel for his family and loved ones.
Found the good apple, gotta throw it out.
They investigated themselves and found no wrong doing.
So the training exercise went according to plan. Killing the snitch is how they are trained.
Danm, and he was all alone while they murdered  him.
Imagine what he was thinking and the shit they were probably talking to him.
This is sickening. 
He was trying to do the right thing.
this is the purpose of the police. i get it now.
What was the training exercise?  How to stop African-American pedestrians?
Coincidence? 100% not
Matty wasn’t dirty.
Better Call Saul reference
such fucking bullshit I swear dude.
Oops.
Training Day
“ KING KONG AINT GOT NOTHING ON ME!”
This is basically the shit that made Dorner snap
Police union ain't gonna do shit about it either.
Lol cops
The price you pay when you don’t back the blue.

Cops are just gangs with the governments blessing.
I've seen exactly one episode of Better Call Saul and it was this one.
Damn RIP, hope they catch the people who did this.
How to get away with murder. Be a cop in LA.
Watch how obviously this was a murder and nothing come of it.
Uh

About the police gang rapes...

The guy investigating that is now conveniently dead

So, anyway...

Let's go kick the shit out of some homeless people
We all know they are definitely guilty. I could be wrong but breh.
Sureeeee
Not shady at all
Okay bardstown
i know this is a generalization but it seems like every day i hop onto this app to find another reason to be afraid of california 😭
Sums up LAPD
Of course the bad cops kill the good ones trying to clean it up. This is why it's going to be hard to reform our whole system. Because food cops get threatened or worse like this one and the absolute corruption continues.
This is why there aren't many good cops.
They killed him jumping him into there gang
ACAB!
Hmmm
So he was supposed to be doing a bicycle training exercise and ends up doing a grappling exercise…  simulated gang attack.  During which he falls to the ground while bear hugging another LAPD officer.

Coroner did not rule it a homicide.  Ruled accidental.

Injuries sustained after he fell to the ground during resuscitation efforts.

https://abc7.com/lapd-officer-houston-tipping-autopsy/12079891/
“What, Officer Pendelburys been shot?”
If this isn’t depressing.
Holy fuck
Cops are stupid and savage subhumans!
Bruh wtf
Sure would be a shame if someone created a database of corrupt cops and published it online, complete with addresses. Would hate to see anyone do that.
Good thing there's a group of people that think only Cops should own guns and the average citizen has no need to defend themselves.....just call the cops.....these cops
I was in law enforcement and I can’t stress this enough... The police CAN NOT police themselves
Fking murdering bastards will get away with another murder !
You can't fix the police until you handle the police unions.
Where is batman? We need batman, or the punisher, or a functioning internal affairs division and to get rid of police unions. any one of those will do
That blue wall has got to be shattered. It’s destroying all respect for the service.
How very Russian of them.
Its nice when they kill their own. Hopefully Karma will reward them with their 2 pounds of flesh for the 1 pound they took.
LAPD has always had a problem with corruption.  Think about it.
If there is only a "few bad apples", how come the good fucking apple is always getting the negative consequences for making the right godamn choice?!
Wait.. the LAPD did something corrupt and shady?!
Now cops aren’t even safe from cops.
Since when do “officers” investigate? Was he a detective or is this clickbait?
Ok you mean to tell me he died during a “simulated mob attack” after grappling with another police officer?! No one stepped in to stop the grappling? Really?!

Oh and check this out:

“Gage claims that Tipping wound up with three broken ribs, a lacerated liver, head injuries, and a broken neck. "His heart eventually stopped working because of his injuries" and "he was paralyzed….He had subdural hematomas at three places on the left side and three places on the right side. There is no way that grappling would have caused those injuries the way the LAPD portrayed it."

And some how in the middle of “grappling” with another cop he somehow ended up with 3 broken ribs, a deep cut in his liver, head injuries and a broken neck?! All that happen while he “grappled” with another LEO?! I ain’t the sharpest knife in the toolshed but i wasn’t born yesterday. This smells like intentional all over it! Aren’t they geared up while training for events like these? You mean to tell me someone was somehow able to get past all that gear and cut his liver and break his ribs AND break his neck!?
gang doing gang shit
All cops are these cops. All cops are complicit. All cops are guilty. All cops are bastards.
Yep I believe it
Typical America
The City of Los Angeles Police Department and the County of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department are the most corrupt public institutions in the United States.
Man what a crazy coincidence/s
Article said he “fell to the ground” and somehow broke his spine? He was 32 not 90. Yeah, definitely murdered.
Someone should call the cops on these people.
Google LASD gangs. 

This applies to LAPD too.
Oh so he was **murdered**.
Amen, praying for you in heaven brother.
Sad for someone but not me
Well that doesn't smell fishy at all.
Shut down the entire police department.
Now that’s a movie or tv series!
Now, this isn't suspicious at all... is it?
Usually I hate cops but this is so fucked. Genuinely chilling that they practically murdered him mob style.
Eric Dorner
And Why Are We Okay with this??? I am so glad I do not live there. How can people keep allowing this to happen?
The first step to making a good cider is crushing all of the good apples into a fine slurry. The bad apples are left behind in the barrel.
See what I mean. I’m right here. If some cops wanted to gang rape someone hello I’m here 👏🏾🤷🏽‍♀️ literally love being used etc.
I guess I’m confused as how was this officer investigating people he worked with? I thought internal affairs would take something like this over
I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.
So we can send feds in the raid homeless camps but they can't wrestle back control of a police force from gangs?
To know that yet another innocent person (police or citizen) falls at the hands of other corrupt individuals just shows that PEOPLE NEED TO FIND JESUS. Evil is everywhere. I hope the victim gets help and the 4 accused of gang rape, get to go, get raped in prison.
LA lol. Californians labeled it normal police operations and continued their steady decline into anarchy.
He had less than four years on. He was not a detective and not investigating anything. He may have completed a bogus SA claim and took a report per the LAPD policy. People need to stop spreading misinformation including his lawyer and mother. He was not assigned to detectives and was not assigned to internal affairs. He was a regular patrol officer working Devonshire division.
Cards Against Humanity is hiring a CEO, but it requires candidates to be Barack Obama

First five years experience for entry level gigs, and now this shit. 
Imagine if Obama considered this but had no word or excel proficiency and thats the one thing on the ad that stops him
Apparently there is [only one](http://howmanyofme.com/people/Barack_Obama/) Barack Obama so he's set
Way to steal Spotifys idea
Hey its me ur Obama
8 years experience as President of the United States or equivalent nation.

Is that equivalent to the US before Trump, or after?
Time to lie on my resume.

I guess it is time to finally change my name to Barrack Obama.
It's as bad as when someone wants a QA guy who does everything and has 3-5 years experience. 
Do you think they'll check if I apply?
Entry level position
Requirements : Have held the office of 44th President of the United States
This is how most job postings are. Not asking specifically for a single person, but the gist is, "___ and ___ are highly encouraged to apply, but the implication is strong we're only going to hire someone who meets impossibly narrow criteria, so narrow in fact that they couldn't possibly be looking for a job anyway." 
I've been thinking of changing my name....
Some suggestions to what cards Obama could write:

* Bombing civvies in 7 different [brown] countries

* Arming rebels with ____ seemed like a good idea untill Trump was elected president

* Having your legacy overturned by a golden combover

Feel free to actually use these, in return I expect a private message saying I'm a cool dude

Who better qualified that fits the job description "Against Humanity" than Barack Obama?
getting involved in politics is poison for many businesses.  you stand to alienate somewhere between 1/4 to 1/3 of your customers for little real benefit
Way to riff off of the joke Spotify already made, cards against humanity. More reddit plugs. 
They went full SJW and became 'Politically correct cards against humanity' a bit ago.

Make fun of kids with ass cancer all you want, but any joke involving islam is offensive.
I'll burn my cards if that happens.
Lmao proves that the creators have a liberal agenda. Not that it was ever a mystery, it was pretty obvious looking at the cards.
The rapist guy at CAH doing this to get his Bill Clinton free pass with Liberals?
Publicly favoring a political party is not a good way to expand your business. Just saying.

Yes I  realize Obama is retired and no that doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. 
Do people still play this crap?
If they made an O'bomber set, with all his best "ya, I didn't close gitmo" cards...  yes, this works for me.
People still care about this company?
Obama would be a shit CEO and ruin their company. 
Sounds like a board game I won't be buying
it would have been funnier to hire someone who didn't want to fill out an application and had no experience.
So zany lol! These guys are soo random.
Discrimination.
Cheap stunt to try to get their name in the spotlight again. Downvoted.
This company is /r/hailcorporate in total overdrive. How do people keep upvoting this shit? This is a fucking ad! 
Cards Against Humanity is hiring a CEO, but it requires candidates to be Barack Obama  
  
It's one thing to be the best-selling party game in history, and another to win over the respect of the creative class. So now Cards Against Humanity, the online multi-use party game known for having a well-rounded trolling repertoire, is looking to make the leap into real world business.  
  
Cards Against Humanity on Wednesday announced that it's looking to fill the CEO position, and it's seeking the right candidate to lead the company toward expansion into new areas of business. It's currently in 10 countries, including Canada, Mexico, and Spain.

"You know how when you drink a lot of tequila, you go to bed with a funny headache, wake up to a broken hip, and then die?" said the job listing, which has a bit of a subtle dig at Donald Trump. "We want someone who can do the same thing with our business, only while making Americans laugh."  
  
Cards Against Humanity takes some joking jabs at presidential candidates. Image: cards against humanity/thatsjemal  
  
The highest job qualifications for the position are an inability to work with anything less than one-page spread documentation. Additionally, candidates must be able to pass a rigorous psychological screening and an absurd amount of harassment from coworkers.  
  
Those looking to apply can do so via email, and should bring their best "troll" impersonation (or perhaps an even more Donald Trump-esque version) to the interview.  
  
"We're looking for someone with a sinister plan," the description reads. "Someone who can back up the obvious awfulness that comes with this job with absolute certainty."

Porn site holds Donald Trump lookalike auditions to hire X-rated actor for series of presidential parodies

>[Alec Baldwin's Trump May Show Up in 'Other Venues' Outside of SNL, He Says](http://tvline.com/2017/01/11/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-saturday-night-live-other-venues/)

Hmmmm.....
I predict significantly less interest in this than Sarah Palin equivalents.
Why get a lookalike? I'm sure he'll do it if asked.
Donald looks like a man who needs to ask his doctor if his heart is healthy enough for sexual activity. 
I found the winner: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0mK-Qj361U0
Just film a cheeto fucking a toothpick. 
"Donald's Tramp"
So will the Trump lookalike fuck the Ted Cruz lookalike?

http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/571aa7551900002e0056c07e.jpeg
They couldn't use the real Donald because he's too busy fucking America.
Please let him get tag team fucked in the ass by Steve Bannon and Putin lookalikes. And maybe a Kellyanne Conway with a strap on.
Proceeds to the ACLU?
Will trump watch these? Oh yes he will. 
Madison Ivy for Melania 
[deleted]
Prediction: Something kinky where he gets dommed.

Ewwwwwwwwwwww...
twist is, it's a gay porn film with Putin lookalike. 
Please be for gay porn.

Pleaaaaaaaaaase.

And even as a straight man, if it is, I will watch it.
It'll be the first micro penis porn! 
Gay porn needs Mike pence casting. 
*Ewwwww...*
Welcome to 2017
Why not just get Trump? I mean he'd probably do it.
Must have:

Scrotum

and Scrotum on neck
Gross. No one wants to see that.
So golden showers?

Im down with that. 
Preferably with tiny penis. 
Must look like Donald Trump.


But not, like, too much like Donald Trump.



Must have tiny hands, for scale.
if i looked anything like donald trump i'd already be hanging from a tree in my local park.
I don't want to see anyone that looks like Trump fucking anything D:

porn why u do this?
Are they hiring a Putin to work with him? 
I can't possibly understand who would watch that on purpose. 
he's already doing an anal penetration scene with my faith in humanity
I guess they have Ivanka already cast?
So who's going to be the Ivanka impersonator?
I hope whoever they find is OK with getting fucked in the ass by a woman painted to look like Lady Liberty. 
Can't wait until the actor has a small penis and Trump calls it a false representation
I am interested to see how he handles this. Will he try to sue them for defamation or something similar and have the videos removed? 
Are they going to have actresses portray characters named Netty Neutrality, Emma Gration, and Ressa 
Quality for him to fuck over?
Offbeat? More like beatoff...
God bless America. 
You guys care about this? You didn't care when they made the Obama porn
 You fucks are nasty 
Thank god he won, imagine Hillary porn.... Ahhhhhhhhhh
The actor better be seriously homosexual otherwise there's no point . He needs to get fucked.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9505  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/46557)
They're going to need one for Putin too, to be his dom in all of the foreign policy scenes.
I hope they hire an Obama lookalike and then get the Trump lookalike *really* give it to him roughly. That would be **perfect**.
Donald Trump lookalike fucking a model dressed like Lady Liberty.
I get that this is funny, but I find it hard to believe that large numbers of people will actually want to masturbate to a naked Donald J Trump.

I could be wrong, of course.
More like r/beatoff amirite? 
Remember the Obama auditions for that gay porn production company? 
I feel bad that there may be another person that orange floating around some where
Hopefully it will be snuff porn.
"Putin-tang" ?
There's already several Trump porn parodies...

[Exhibit 1](http://porngirlserotica.com/twistyshard/eva-lovia-sexy-reporter-fucking-trump-parody/)

[Exhibit 2](http://woodrocket.com/videos/donald-tramp-the-xxx-parody)

[Exhibit 3](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph57696d53e2ac8)

Obviously NSFW...
Only if all the actresses he has scenes with are named America
Now instead of circle jerking, Reddit can finally jerk off themselves!
Should be an easy role to fill. Any little prick will do.
Sponsored by Trump to provide plausible deniability when the Russian piss video is leaked?
Dude. He's 70. 
http://imgur.com/nu5teit.gif
Ewwwww but why?? 

I mean I get the Sarah Palin lookalike - when she ran for VPOTUS she was MILF/GMILF hot.

...but there's nothing attractive about Drumpf.
Trump will be the first to watch it
Hope they find a spot on match who happens to also have a small package. It would be the easiest and funniest propaganda ever. If only I looked like Donald id apply and easily get the job after explaining the value of my qualifications. 
Ewww... this sounds like the most dick shriveling porn in existence; a full on boner killer.
I wonder if they are also looking for lookalikes of me??
they'd be better off getting someone that sounds like him and is about the same weight because they can fix the rest with a makeup artist and hair stylist.
I'm assuming there will some exploration of "alternative consent" & etc. 
That's kinda gross. Kellyanne Conway and Betsy Devos dopplebangers tho...
I hope they get ahold of that guy who looks like Mike Pence who was raising money for Planned Parenthood in Times Square without any pants a while back.
Who would want to watch that?! I've heard of rule 34 but really?
I downloaded a porno spoof on Obama, Obamas nailin Palin, they did a great job casting a lookalike. 
Donald's Rump. Definitely will be gay porn. Should also be a gang bang with a bunch of Mexicans who jump a wall and then have their way with him. Work in a prolapse in there somewhere.
When offbeat meets beatoff.
I'm all for mocking Trump, but why the fuck would anyone want to watch even someone pretending to be him having sex?! Donald Trump is among the least sexually desirable people on the planet.
Ew
They should get a bottom and have a woman with a dildo dress up as Lady Liberty and peg him "you like getting fucked just like you fucked up America huh?" and Trump says "omg it's huge!" 

I have plenty of ideas. 
would it really be that out of the question to think Trump would just do it himself lol 
There was no winner this election when it comes to the porn parodies. 
[removed]
But the D has got to be YUUUGE.
Gross 
This is how Lisa Ann's career got lanched because she looked like Sarah Palin.
Can't wait for the Bannon-Trump-Putin spitroast scene. 
His ratings will be as big as his hands.
Please let it be gayporn to piss him off if he gets to know about it
Will it be gay porn featuring Bannon pitching? Maybe a pegging scene featuring a Hillary look a like?

FYI, I don't find anything wrong with these scenarios, it just seems like something Trump would hate to know is happening. 
I bet /The_Donald is fucking salivating at the prospect.
Oh so it'll be a rape style porno! 
I pity the kid whose first exposure to porn is when one of the older kids pulls up a Trump vid for a laugh. Just think of the emotional scars.
Great, so when the real pee tapes come out, he'll have deniability. "That's not me... that's alternate me."
Now has *this* ever happened in history? Has a president been so hated by the opposing side that they have made satirical pornographic material based on their presidency? 
So we're going to see Trump plowing Hillary while she's on life support? Sign me up and get me a popcorn bucket.
could he get on their case for "deformation of character" or some bs?
Imagine if they had done that to Obama. They would bashed to hell.
Threechum, here we come.
Jesus, who the fuck would want to see that? Politics aside, this is horrifying.
I would say Ron Jeremy, since he's losing his hair. But Ron has a sizable penis, and we all pretty much know Trump has a small one....I mean, everything he does screams he's over compensating. 
Seeing this thread's title in something called "r/offbeat", I instantly assumed that this sub was all about porn news from SFW sites. Was disappointed.
Why get and impersonater? Dude's already been in two pornos.
They better get the tiny hands and penis to size. 
I'd rather watch goatse
A Melania or Ivanka lookalike would be a lot more popular
I've got a little dick and a yuge ego. Maybe I should try out for the part?
I hope they cast a guy with a tiny dick and an actress with tiny hands so that when she's jerking him off they can drop in the line, "Oh my god my dick looks yuge in your tiny hands."
You know that Facebook sticker of a smiley throwing up? 

Yeah that was my first thought here.  
Looks like its Alec Baldwin's time to shine.
Why not just ask Donald Trump? He'd probably do it. 
The one time I actually wished I looked like trump 
As if Trump hasn't auditioned
It does occur to me that putting a President known to hold grudges in to a porn movie *might* not be a career-enhancing move. 
Did they even bother to check if the real Donald trump might be up for it/ 
Grab em by the pussy, Donald!
Being a huge fan of pussy grabbing and pissing on prostitutes, you know the original, real Donald Trump must be strongly tempted to apply.
"Put it in, Putin."
Ewwww!
Yimakh shemo
If it includes some latina action, it's gonna be YUUUGE
Hey, it's me, Donald.
Oh for Christ's sake. We're already all getting fucked by that man, who the hell wants to watch him fuck more?
I wonder who would be the most proud here, the parents of the actual president, or the parents of the guy who kinda looks like him to do porn. It is a toss up really. 
Wanted to say this wasn't really offbeat news. Then I realized reddit will totally beat off to it.
Who is going to dress up as America and let themselves get fucked?
The only way I would watch this is if the female lead was named America 
So,

Russian golden showers, simulated incest with Ivanka, and interracial?

I'm in.
but y tho
During the Clinton era, they wouldn't have needed lookalikes....
I jerked off to shadman's Hillary Clinton pictures.
No
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/ZvVGGQU.png)

I hope you like it
What are the odds that it is masochistic liberals that get off to it? 
I am a Trump supporter and I approve it. Lol
He will be flattered as long as they don't have a 'problem' down there
How can neither of them do the voice? That's key and it's not that difficult to do.
Given how crazy Trump is about his image, I smell a lawsuit from him on the subject. 
I hope they make pee pee porn.
Uggggh, why? Why would I want to watch a naked trump?
Give us the Putin 3===> Trump masterpiece that we all want!
I've already seen various parodies....
Just get the real one, I'm sure he'd do it 
That's going to be an expensive film to cast all of America as who he is fucking.
Love this! I worship trump and the thought that I will get to see my imaginations of him pounding some libtard pissy has me diamonds right now! 
Safe to say many of these videos will be in the incest category.
Ted Cruz thinks people don't have a right to "stimulate their genitals." I was his college roommate. This would be a new belief of his.

I can't handle this election.
#"The Time Ted Cruz Defended a Ban on Dildos"
(http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/ted-cruz-dildo-ban-sex-devices-texas)

For those wondering what the hell this is about.

>The brief insisted that Texas, in order to protect "public morals," had  "police-power interests" in "discouraging prurient interests in sexual gratification, combating the commercial sale of sex, and protecting minors." There was a  "government" interest, it maintained, in "discouraging…autonomous sex." The brief compared the use of sex toys to "hiring a willing prostitute or engaging in consensual bigamy," and it equated advertising these products with the commercial promotion of prostitution. In perhaps the most noticeable line of the brief, Cruz's office declared, "There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one's genitals for non-medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship." That is, the pursuit of such happiness had no constitutional standing. And the brief argued there was no "right to promote dildos, vibrators, and other obscene devices." The plaintiffs, it noted, were "free to engage in unfettered noncommercial speech touting the uses of obscene devices," but not speech designed to generate the sale of these items.

It's a lot funnier and a lot more on point if you have context.

Now that you do, why don't you go [#DiddleForJustice](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiddleForJustice?src=hash)?
Surely abstaining from 'stimulating your genitals' could lead to serious mental problems by resisting urges which could manifest in creating serial killer.
I almost Googled 'Ted Cruz genitals' to see what speech his ex-roomate was talking about before realizing that would be a terrible idea.
/r/offbeat or /r/beatoff?
They're my genitals and I'll be fucked if I let you tell me how to stimulate them.

I never said a single thing about Cruz or his killing spree back in the 60s and the 70s.  But this is where I draw the goddamned line.

[Proof.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CY3-XnoUQAAWwsL.jpg)
I think I have a right for Ted Cruz to not care about what I do in my spare time.

I'd tell him to go fuck himself...but he clearly doesn't think that's an option.
I really hope whoever has his/her finger on the nuke button has a healthy dose of masturbation on a daily basis.
**TED CRUZ CONFIRMED WANKER.**
Call me unimaginative; but how does a skin suit full of spiders  masturbate?

The Republican party, the party that wants government out of your lives.

Unless of course you are a woman. Then they want to stick government far up your womb.

Or if you're gay, then they want government watching your bedroom so they can throw you in jail for your perversity.

And it you dare wake up with a raging hard on, government won't let you touch that boner.
Is Ted Cruz a condition that happens to people when their genitals stop working or something?
The American elections this year are an absolute freak show. From an outside perspective, I wish you guys the best of luck, seriously. 
Decided to look up Craig Mazin out of curiosity, and ended up falling down a Google hole full of negative accounts. How does someone who inspires hate from his closest acquaintances get so close to becoming president of the U.S.?

Well, that's nothing a circle jerk couldn't resolve.
So..these are the depths American 'Democracy' dwells at these day, eh?
OP if you really are his college roommate your tweets are amaizing. I cant say who, but I work for a large publisher and we love them!
Can't even look at that ass hat. I keep thinking that he's nothing more than a giant nest of spiders under a stolen human skin. Goddamnit, what a fucking creep.
I don't get it.  The Government can't regulate corporate bodies but it can regulate our corporeal bodies. 

YOU CAN PRY MY GENITALS FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS
Just a reminder: Marco Rubio and John Kasich were non-viable candidates to the GOP this year.

In 2012, only one candidate tested favorably against President Obama: Jon Huntsman. He was too centrist.

So here we are with a reality star and a chronic masturbator on the right, trying to win the GOP.

I've voted Republican more often than not since 2004, (I'm centrist tho; picked President Obama in 08, and after Huntsman dropped out), but i can't forrsee voting for another republican in the presidential election again
Mazin is the best. He posts in the screenwriting subreddit sometimes. Yo, /u/clmazin, anything you wanted to add to this thread? "Diddle for justice" was pretty great...
The right wing is not looking out for Christian morals or ideals, or upholding anything actually conservative. They are out to destroy everyone's sex lives. Watch out this is the beginning of going after you and me. They start with homosexuals, they continue with masturbation, they use anti abortion and pre-marital as the wedge in to all sex at all. They are after all of us.
Please get towards the top of r/all

I want more background info, but I think I'm gonna have to use incognito mode to search for "Ted Cruz stimulate genitals".
maybe he meant gentiles
For a party that believes staunchly in property rights...
I'd offer Ted Cruz some lotion for that burn but know what he'd use it for instead. 
Cum shots fired.
Close, but wrong sub.  
/r/nofap
Hurry, someone get a Kickstarter going that will raise money for a crate-full of dildo's, vibrators, and other misc. sex toys to be sent to Ted Cruz's home.  This would be the first time I've sent money to benefit a Republican, and hopefully their wife too!
So you're saying that if my room mate who liked to do that on the top bunk runs for prez I finally get to get back at him? Fuck yes!
Let me just say "Thank You" for posting this.

The syllables of this sub are in the wrong order.
"Don't have a *right* to *stimulating your genitals*??"

What the absolute fuck? What kind of 1984 shit is this?
Oddly enough, Ted Cruz is my safety word 
I'll stimulate my body and no one better get in my way or we will have a sticky situation on our hands!
But what if you are trying to make a political point by "stimulating your genitals" you would have a substantive right to free speech.
flip-fapping
What does he gain from this? Some 90 year old Catholics vote? What's the benefit to being so backward? Next he'll be enforcing female genital mutilation.
I believe you meant to post in /r/beatoff?
Whenever I think for the slightest second that Cruz would be a better choice than Trump, we get this stupidity spewing out.

/Don't worry Reddit, I'm voting for Bernie.
Savage.
Ted Cruz, latest member of r/NoFap 
Wanker
I think I need a mind eraser... I use can't get that image out my head 
He spanks to a new beat these days. Or is it new beats same as the old beats.
..so he made it seem okay when he stimulated yours?
No please I dont want that idea in my head. Young cruz fapping furiously while he asks god for forgiveness for his falicious faith is not something I can deal with.

This could be some House of Cards BS going down here. (Not that I don't find it hypocritical.)
#ROOMIEREKT
I guess it's time to add another constitutional amendment. 
Since no one said it yet: Cruz may be a terrible person/candidate, but I think you made this up for fake internet points. 
Huh, a post about beating off on offbeat.
Just thought I'd leave this here; The original 10 "condemnents" were originally affirmations before they were transliterated to make religion a political affair.
What a savage...anyone know if this is true?
true, why vote for someone who has learned anything or changed their ways since they were 19...
But he can cheat on his wife?! Fuck you Teddy!! Fuck you!
Lmao this is too perfect 
Ftfy /r/beatoff 
Ted really just needs a bogel for the glotch. 
There is no right to "amplify your voice" so microphones should be banned. see how stupid that is?

lol someone nuke us this species isn't worth it
holy shit hilarious....some twitter dude.

@clmazin This is the most disturbing image that I've ever had conjured in my head. I lost something today I didn't know I could give.

Grayson Allen was born in October of 1995, meaning he was likely conceived in January of that year. 

Ted Cruz was technically still in college at this time, he graduated from Harvard Law later in 1995.

It is possible.
How is this Offbeat?
Blaming Ted Cruz for things he did as solicitor General of Texas is like blaming a police officer because you don't agree with the speed limit. His job was to find a way to prosecute people under the law. If you don't like the fact that he was good at his job you're arguing that you'd rather have an incompetent lawyer as president. If you disagree with the laws he was tasked with enforcing your real beef is with the legislators who wrote those laws.
Holy shit the exposure
Hey morons, he was doing his job as the solicitor general defending the state's position on the issue, not his personal ones. He was doing the job he was legally obligated to do.  Much like Hillary Clinton defending child molesters when she was a defense attorney.  
I had my doubts about Ted Cruz.  Now, ... I still have my doubts about Ted Cruz.

I'm sorry.

Don't look at what's happening over there! Look at the genitals over here!

To be fair, he was a lawyer--he was just making an argument
How dare Cruz the job he was legally appointed to do!

I swear, it's as if Reddit wants to know *just* enough to be misinformed, but not informed enough to be forced to realize they support people doing the same thing. He didn't even pursue it past the appeals court.
this is like the Hillary defending a child rapist. we don't impute on lawyers what they do for their clients in court 
Savage burn 🔥🔥🔥
Listen assholes, when you're a lawyer the arguments you make don't necessarily reflect your views.
;
We don't have the right, we have the privilege. 
The holier than thou Republican Party what a bunch of hypocrites they have no morals but like to project like they are the party of morals
People will say whatever the can to tear others down these days. It's pathetic
You poor bastard!  There’s no amount of bleach I can scrub my brain with that will get that image out of my head!
I’m having a hard time thinking of a creepier fucker to be speaking about in the article
Well, he has no balls so it makes sense that he would think that…
The ones that say "don't do this and that" are the ones doing it. I bet he has Philippino trans prostitute doing the stimulation for him.
You wouldn’t have a debate like this in the mad mullah’s Iran. I’m certain lads and lassies there just take the issue in hand and get to grips with it.
Anyone who thinks Bernie has a chance is delusional.
I wish this wasn't on my head
