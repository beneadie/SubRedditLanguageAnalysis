Makes sense but my heart hurts

Without him, crime doesn’t have a punchline
There is something so Joker about not showing up if the real Batman won't be there
This is the saddest shit I've read 😔
"You Complete Me"
Sad but I respect Mark staying loyal to Conroy's Batman for Mark no other person can be his Batman and that is a saddening thought but we all know how mark killed every Joker role and it seemed he had fun doing all of it
You know Kevin was a legend when Luke Skywalker himself refuses to do it without Conroy there
Idk the source, but I read somewhere that Mark Hamill didn't want to keep being the Joker because it hurt his voice but he agreed to stay Joker as long as Kevin Conroy would be his Batman
My emotions.
So sad, met Kevin once at a convention. They say don't meet your heroes but he was the nicest man you could meet. His passing still hurts 💔
Without Kevin, Batman has no punchline.
They were essentially a bonded pair. Two GOATs. How could he ever work with someone else?
I'm just glad there's so many voice actors who took inspiration from Hamill and Conroy's performances; in Batman vs. the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Troy Baker can do both roles.
Damn, that makes Mark’s line of “Without Batman, Crime has no punchline.” Hit even harder💔🥹.
As sad as it is, I’m glad Mark Hamill is taking this stance. If I heard him and it wasn’t accompanied by Kevin Conroy as Batman, I wouldn’t enjoy it as much. And I don’t think I’m alone.

To me, no other voice actor would have a chance if Mark’s involved because it would just draw attention to Kevin not being there
Aww much respect to Mark for that.
In the 84 years that batman has been around, only one person was able to represent the definitive batman, just goes to show how great of an actor Kevin was… RIP.
Batman’s biggest fan was the joker. Seems that’s true in real life too
That breaks my heart but honestly, I understand. They were the perfect combo after all, and it would just feel a little bittersweet and empty with one without the other.

There's no other way to sum it up than with, "Without Batman, crime has no punchline."
Mark “Either I will play Joker opposite Kevin Conroy’s Batman or I will not play Joker.” Hamill. My personal favorite Joker performance, so I’m sad to read this, but it’s understandable.
I can respect it. Hate that it happened that way, hopefully he'll be open to revisiting if someone else takes it as seriously but I doubt it.
I expected this.  You can't have one without the other.  It wouldn't be right.  Hamill knows that.  He's a true professional and an even better friend.

This hit so much harder than I expected it to
Man, Kevin Conroy is one of only three celebrity deaths that actually hit me. Not only was he amazing at his work, but the fact that everyone that worked with him loved him, and the lack of controversy around him, makes me believe he was such a genuinely nice guy.
I thought mark had retired after killing joke.But yeah it would not be the same with Kevin.The whole universe that Bruce timm created was built around kevin.
That is really sad and I’m sorry for that. However, Alan Tudyk deserves the crown next; he voices the Joker in the HBO Harley Quinn show and he is amazing.
I think The Joker would actually give up if Batman died. Like "what's the point"
“Without Batman crime has no punchline”
it’s so crazy because that’s something the joker would actually do
I love Mark Hamill and what he brought to the Joker, he will be missed, I spent a long time practicing his rendition as the joker and can do it spot on. I hope that they can find someone that brings as much life to the joker as him.
My sentiments exactly.
[Only You](https://youtu.be/5b23MR0p5kA)
Currently watching the animated series to commemorate him.
As a 90s child, there is no recovering from this.
Man this is what Joker would totally say
Once again, Mark Hamill proves he's a fantastic person. And I agree. Without Kevin, that has to hurt more than we can fully understand.
End of an era. 😞😞
Sigh..."Well, that was fun! Who's for Chinese?"

I am saddened we may never hear the one true Clown Prince of Crime, but I understand the reasoning behind it. Without Kevin Conroy as Batman, the crimes of Mark Hamill's Joker have no punchline. I knew it from the moment we were given the sad news in November 2022 that broke many a Batfan's hearts. Mad respect, but respect nonetheless between frenemies.

![gif](giphy|NyhxF81JQC3SM)
Really sad. But good lord why is screen rant click-baiting Kevins death with a old interview.
“Without Batman crime has no punchline.”😔
Well…where’s that other guy who voices the joker in Batman 2004
Troy Baker in Arkham Origins is a great choice to voice Joker
I totally agree with him. I’m in the same boat in a scene. Now whenever I think of Batman, it’s hits me, Batman is dead. It’s crazy, Batman’s dead. 💔🥲
This is such an unironically Joker thing to do lmao
Man it hurts on this and as the classic joker quote goes

"Without Batman, crime has no punch" sadly true
This might sound weird but I agree. Mark and Kevin were THE two voices across from each other. Let’s remember their contributions, and then let’s find another pair of actors who can continue this legacy.
Damn, a real joker answer too
While it sucks he doesn’t sound like he would come back - I respect the hell outta him for this. RIP Kevin Conroy
That is the most Joker thing I’ve ever heard. “Yes, there might be a Batman. But he’s not *my* Batman. And if he’s not *my* Batman, what’s even the point of being Joker.”
I thought he was also having trouble with the joker voice and the toll it takes on him these days.?
I bet he will continue to voice other dc characters in the future but yes it is truly time for him to.retire his Joker voice in honor of Kevin Conroy. Pretty confident he never voiced Joker in anything with out Kevin Conroy voicing Batman.
This one hurts
Right in the childhood.
This is pretty tragic but I feel like it's probably the right decision, to honour Kevin of course but also I feel we've only ever heard this joker with this batman. Hearing one without the other would be strange.
am I the only one that read that with a joker impression?
He a real one.....Kevin and mark
God that fucking hurts to read and see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b23MR0p5kA
Is Mark confirmed doing a voice in the suicide squad game then?
Stop posting Screenrant. They are an unethical company that pays slave wages to writers to churn out their stories
Why head hurt?
The last laugh....😭
Without Princess Leia, there is no Luke Skywalker 😔
This made my eyes wet.
💔💔💔
The two are so intrinsically tied to Batman that even when they weren’t the Caped Crusader and the Clown Prince in some productions, they still had make guest appearances.
This is so beautiful.... and so so sad... RIP Kevin Conroy, you will always be my favorite batman...
Oooooow i think my heart just broke all over again…
I feel there could be a really good send off to this saga, with mark Hamill as the joker in a universe where batman dies. I have a feeling something like that would be good.
man, now i’m crying again
Yeah, that's understandable and Mark Hamill is the GOAT anyway.
Kevin’s passing still gets to me. In like the span of 2 months we lost Batman and The Green Ranger and it absolutely gutted my inner child. Those two characters were huge inspirations for me growing up and it felt like part of my soul was ripped away when they passed. I hope both are in a better place now. They will always be the best at their respective roles.
Totally understand that. Still sad that we lost Kevin Conroy. 

While we may see the classic animated Batman and Joker again, it will be kind of crazy to see them with difference voices if it ever happens.
This doesn't feel right, we know Conroy passed away but there are other ways to pay respect. People want Hamill back because of his great work not because he starred with Conroy
I’m not crying!
I’ve tried to watch a couple of the animated movies with Kevin and Mark. I couldn’t finish them. Not the same for me.
This hurts.
When I read that last part, it sounded like sad Joker’s voice in my head.
We lost the greatest detective there ever was. Mark Hamill lost a life long friend.

RIP Kevin Conroy, you made my childhood unforgettable.😭
“He’s really not coming…”
I'd love to see him return for a Batman Beyond movie in some way, though I'm not sure how you could do without just redoing the whole Return of the Joker movie.
I mean it’d probably be trivial to use conroy’s contributions thus far to generate new content.
Professionals have standards.
Totally fair. Let the legends move on and let a new gen of voice actors get the chance to prove themselves.

These characters will always be around. They're gonna grow and change like anything else.
Just when you thought couldn’t respect Mark Hamill any more than you already do, he does this.
This hits hard. Thanks Joker. What a great generation.
“Without Batman, crime has no punchline.”
The Joker himself couldn't have said it better...
This is an appropriate reaction from the Joker.
I personally don’t want Hamill to be Joker anymore. He’s had an amazing run. If he can’t continue without Kevin then I don’t want him to do it either. [+]
Almost like the real Joker, in a non-creepy psychotic way.
without batman there will be no joker 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BEAUTIFUL
I miss Kevin every day....i can't imagine how hard it would be for Mark.
Yea, honestly, Hamil as the Joker just won’t be the same without Conroy as Batman

Edit: left the word “without” out of my initial comment
I don't get it. You guys easily accept tons of Batman and Joker live action actors, but you for crying out loud can't accept other voice actors than Conroy and hamill?
Ehh love Mark but it's time to move on Tbh
Big sad
We lost our Batman.
I feel you
Would Hamill settle for a Will Friedle, again?
Without Kevin honestly Batman is gone he was Batman!  without Batman crime for the Joker has no punchline so it makes sense for Mark to retire i can only imagine the grief he must be going through after the lost of a true close friend who he has been performing alongside for 30 years
If there is another Joker they could use, John DiMaggio wasn't bad. Of course he's not the silly type but to me Troy Baker tries so hard to copy Hamill, while I'm kinda glad Hamill is stepping away from the role, I hope whatever choice they make they choose wisely.
😥
:(
Respect
"Without Batman, crime has no punchline."
While I hope he does Joker one more time, it sadly seems fitting to not do the character again without Kevin
This isn't the point but I feel like the actual joker would say the exact same thing
I think they could do the Joker in a Megamind scenario
Man i’ll never get over this. 😕
I figured if one died the other would notreturn, but I did not want it to be true. We lost the best duo
How dare you give me feels?
Rip best joker you gave us the best clown Prince of crime for generations.
Even the voice actors are dependent on each other. Beautiful
I won’t lie, I’m disappointed to hear this. But whole heartedly support his creative and personal decision. They really were the perfect anti duo
My first emotions were pain and anger because I can't imagine Joker without Mark. But I gave it some thought and I can see that for him he might not be ready emotionally to get back into that character that he shared with Kevin for so long and I really get that. So maybe it's time for some new talented voice actor to come forward and take their shot
Where's my goddamned electric car.
We get him in Star Citizen in 40 years though.
.....gulp....he is the definitive Batman for me. The fact that its animated means you can do whatever with the costume and have it look good and that downbeat voice is just so damn Batman. Perfect combo.
lego joker moment
*Darth Vader* 

Nnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooo
I think Bruce Greenwood did an excellent job as Batman in Under the Red Hood and Youmg Justice.
Fuuuuuuck, my soul T_T
I’m going to sit quietly in the corner now
Sad upvote
OMG he's Lego joker!
This broke my heart again today. He was my hero.
To me, Arkham Knight is the best finale to Mark Hamil and Kevin Conroy... *Spoiler for those who haven't played the game* when you play as the main character, and you get up to the last level where you mercesly beat them up, you feel some sort of satisfaction. But when. You relentlessly beat the Joker and lock him away for good, there was a hint of sadness... that was it, that was the end for them. Thank you Mark and Kevin.
If thats not love and dedication, i dont know what is.
Joker looks so sad in that pic :(
I still hurt knowing Mr. Hamill was hurt by Kevin's passing as well. I'll miss him as the Clown Prince. 😔
Classiest answer ever.
For me when kevin passed i felt like batman died with him. I only grew up with him as batman and no one else can be batman for me.
If it makes you feel better, Alan Tudyk does an amazing Joker on Harley Quinn
This one hurts
Dammit Hamil, stop being so wholesome.
Goddamn onion-cutting Joker ninjas.
Good actors are just people who are very good at roleplaying, and the roleplay isn't the same with another person
He was a good joker, but he was a great cock knocker!
Also kind of warms my heart like, he gets the dynamic that made his Joker so perfect. It’s funny; We always talk about how iconic Hammil’s Joker is. If it weren’t for Heath Ledger, I would suspect Hammil would be kind of undisputed. But the strength of his Joker is directly related to Kevin Conroy’s full-blown perfect Batman. Conroy is still probably my favorite Batman. The way he had that menace in his voice but then that total congeniality as Bruce. He was really something else. Props to Hammil for respecting that.
Why the fuck am I so sad
Damn, that shit hits hard
"Without Batman crime has no punchline"
Just like the Joker is co-dependent of Batman, Hamill is/was co-dependent of Conroy.

It's really sad but also a warming tribute.
Troy Baker and Roger Craig Smith then.
Ironically fitting
Welp
 There goes my plan for not being sad tonight
Get Kevin! We need mark to play joker! Any time I think joker I hear mark.
I'm still fucked up over Kevin Conroy dying. Kevin and Mark playing off of each other is some of the best fucking English voice acting of all time.
Mark Hamill - funny and good dude.
Wait, didn't he voice Joker in Robot Chicken even though they got someone other than Kevin to voice Batman?
Mark is the personification of Joker's relationship with Batman. His Batman is gone, so he sees no reason to still be the Joker.
Bruh I didn't need to cry today :(
We still have the awesome series and animated movies, games and they will always be here to enjoy
I understand the sentiment, but imagine how great it would be for the new voice of Batman to have Hamill's support? Someone has got to take up the mantle, after all.
Mark has that horrible human curse where you outlive your friends
Makes sense for my heart
I cry evry tim 😢
Didnt he stop playing Joker before Conroy died
Such a tremendous loss…
I’m not surprised. I’ve already come to accept it due to me remember that fact whenever Kevin passed. We’ve lost our Batman and our Joker but they’re will be a new Kevin and Mark as Batman and Joker all we have to do is wait.
So that’s why he does the same voice, but as Skeletor instead.
It feels like the most joker thing ever to not be present without batman

Kevin was Mark’s Joker’s batman
It will never be the same ever again 🤔😔
That is sad and Kevin will ways be no1 batman but their are other great batman voices who have been working along side Kevin for years
![gif](giphy|ckGndVa23sCk9pae4l)
There's a sort of rhythm to these things.......
I hope whoever the next iconic voice of Batman has an equally iconic Joker. Their relationship and chemistry is what made them so special.
Looks like Troy Baker is going to be getting more work. Happily he voices Batman and Joker and is pretty damn good at both. Not Conroy and Hamill good, but still.
It's poetic that Hamills sentiment echos what the Joker would feel.

Life imitating art.
Fuck that's sad 😭
There is no me without you  
I will behave, I will be  
An afterthought, your make believe  
Your darkest day is your friend in need (ha ha ha ha)  
\- Coheed and Cambria - Deranged (Arkham City Soundtrack)
An extremely privileged position from a man who earned it many times over.
Do it **for** Kevin. We still need **your** voice!
That sucks because he got brought back to life in Arkham City , I just found his secret Audio tape explaining everything
Well hes been stupid for a while now
I bet they used that strategy to get a bigger check too.
I mean what they’re doing to the character rn I’m glad Hamill is quitting, FK DC comics.
He’s an anti feminist hypocritical douche, so it’s ok with me.

Edit: downvote guys, that’s ok. Be just as anti-choice and hypocritical as he is.
Big frown.
i mean it makes sense. kevin was his and our batman. seeing his joker with another batman would be wrong
He was clearly good friends with Kevin Conroy and he gets his best performance with him also showing respect to his late friend

the Arkham Trilogy remains the GOAT imo, we got 3 games filled to the brim of consistently brilliant dialogue and moments between the two great actors
I mean I remember when Hamill said he would retire after Arkham Asylum, and then said he was convinced to come back for Arkham City so he can end his character's story properly. And then I guess he kept getting convinced because after the surprise return in Knight, it seemed like he was back for good. 

So I wouldn't take this statement as any kind of guarantee.
Litteraly the embodiment of Batman and Jokers relationship
even if he quit, for everyone he will always be the one, true, and only Joker. everyone before and after him are pale imitiations of him. Nicholson in 89 was the closest to Joker in live action
Worst news I heard since hearing my father passed away. Seriously, Hamill Joker is the best, period.
The circumstances are, of course, so sad and unfortunate. If anything, I would have loved to watch Kevin pass on the bat torch when he retired. But we don't get that now, and now we lose the greatest Joker as well. Nobody can replace either of them. But there have been people who proved that they can continue the two legacies. I'm honestly curious to watch who does.
Imo they have never captured Batman and the Joker better than in the animated series/movies with the two of them.
Sad but inevitable. I wouldn’t want him being anyone else’s Joker either.
i'm playing through Arkham City now for the first time (i know, i only have so much time to play and i have a massive backlog) and hearing Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reminds me that we had a perfect and definitive pair of voice actors for Batman and the Joker.  Batman represents a perennial franchise and will likely be redone and rebooted every so often for the remainder of western civilization so long as it makes money; there are likely to be dozens more in the cowl and greasepaint, some may even be excellent at their portrayals.  but chances are, none will have the impact that these two men have had.

i totally understand why Mark Hamill doesn't want to reprise his role.  what a heartbreaker to have lost Kevin Conroy so young.
Makes me want a movie where Batman dies from a lucky thugs shot and Joker just melts down.
RIP Kevin Conroy
You don't split a great double  act Mark need Conroy to be his straight man.
*Sad Joker laugh*
I don't think my heart would be in it if they cast Hammil for any project without Conroy. They've always been THE definitive voices.
This brought me to tears
I thought he quit a long time ago because of the toll it out on his voice?
Imagine Mark back for one more performance. (For real guys trust me this time.)

Have it be Nightwing, Red Robin, Red Hood, and Robin all trying to stop the Joker only for the Joker to stop partway through when he realizes Batman isn't coming.

Have him figure it out that Batman died. Joker didn't do it and he's done.

Just let Mark in the booth act out his feelings towards Kevin and by extension the Joker's. Could be powerful as fuck.
I love some of the other voice actors that have played batman, but Kevin was and forever will be THE Batman to me.
He’ll be back. They need a proper send off for the most iconic Joker.
One of my favorite Batman scenes of all time.

Good scene :)  Batman definitely has that soft-spot for lost kids, eh?
Kevin Smith cried like a child when talking to Kevin Conroy about this scene. It was in his Fatman on Batman podcast. He said it really changed his view in death and made him more comfortable w/ his own mortality. Definitely worth a listen. It’s towards the end but the whole episode is amazing. 

Fun fact: Did you know Kevin Conroy went to Juilliard at the same time as Christopher Reeve? Think about that for just a minute....

Made me tear up
I wish they could replicate even a tenth of the humanity and character of batman from the DCAU in these new movies
There are so many great Batman moments sprinkled into these episodes. So many creatives had something important to say about these characters, and I’m glad they were given the opportunity to play in this sandbox. This is why we love comics. They tread places nobody else can because they have so much sincerity built into these characters. You can only pull off episodes like this with decades of love and support behind you.
Makes me tear up every time. He cares about them as much as he cares about the people he saves. That's why the get sent to an asylum. To be cured so they won't hurt anymore. Batman looks tough, but he's the biggest softie of them all.
Is this sped up? It seems bizarre for some reason. 
[deleted]
They should just give the DC cinematic universe over to Paul Dini and Bruce timm with a blank check
That's why he named his dog after her.
why was she going to die? was the government going to kill her or was it something not included here?
/r/mildlysatisfying when Waller's device fit perfectly in Batman's pouch.
Is JLU worth a watch?
Reminds me of the V for Vendetta scene where he kills the botanist/doctor woman
The video link for audio

https://youtu.be/jWHHsdE_oQg
Please put this in /r/batmangifs too
Chokes me up every time
I wonder if it made him blue.
This is why Batman will always be my favorite.
I liked when he sings to rescue wonder woman 
I can't watch this without weeping a little. 

I recently lost my mom, and i tried to be there by her side every day leading up, for as much time as i could. the whole, being by her side until the time came, this scene now reminds me of it.
scenes like this are why I really love stoic characters if done well, like Roland from the dark tower. having supporting characters that are able to show a different side to them can be so overwhelmingly powerful and add a lot of depth.
Amidst all the "he can beat anything with prep time!" memes and criticism of his methods and Mary Sue-istic writing, people tend to forget that Batman is basically just a guy with a really big heart and earth-shattering PTSD.
The original video linked at the top does so much more then what the GIF can offer. The top comment on the video makes you feel even harder after watching the whole thing:

*"As a kid I thought this was the easiest fight Batman has ever had, all he had to do was sit on a swing and hold her hand. As an adult I realize it was the hardest".*
Met someone about 6 months ago who said she hated Bataan because he was always angry. This right here is one of the very reasons why I love him 

Edit: not going to really edit because it's funny but I wrote Bataan.

Manly tears...
Zack Snyder version

*Batman shoots her in the leg with a sniper rifle, runs over to her and smashes her shoulder in. He ties her to his Batmobile and drags her around the city as he runs over criminals (civilians?), and Superman snarls in the background. We are treated to another monologue about gods, then we get more slo-mo action scenes against a depressing red sky background*
As soon as I saw "Ace" and noticed the suit of clubs on her costume, I logged in to post this. I almost never post.

EDIT: Wow am I overtired... I thought that ace was a suit. Like I thought that her name was Hearts, and she had a spade on her suit. I am just gunna go now.

THIS IS WHY I NEVER POST
This is the very scene I think about when I think about why I don't like the DCEU movies. Only *Wonder Woman* has been able to get close to something like this, and even then it's miles away still. 

As a lifelong DC fan I hope, but this will always be my Justice League.
Also, Batman The Animated Series. The HARDAC episodes.
Batman...what a wonderful fucking Superhero.

He is the hero we deserve...but not the one we need right now.
THIS is the batman I like. There for people not just beating up mentally ill people.
Wow that's unexpectedly deep. This was a cartoon?
Hope this isn't frowned upon here, but I'm on a team working on a fan-made webcomic that follows up after this show (Justice League Unlimited) and into Batman Beyond. So far it's only a few issues in, and in my opinion the writing is excellent and does a great job of following the same soul of the DCAU. As far as the comic goes, I'm only responsible for making sure all the continuity lines up (we're taking the tie in comics into consideration as well, and with recent resurgence in DCAU media, it's a large task) so I don't feel like praising the work is rooting my own horn too hard. Anyway, the comic is called [Legacies of the DCAU](http://legaciesdcau.com) and is at that link for free. Hope you guys enjoy.
Beneath it all, Batman still understands what it's like to be a scared kid. 
This episode was up there with some of the gut punches TAS threw out (hi Baby Doll). Looking back on growing up with that, I think portrayal of both the wrongness of crime and them being the victims of their own madness/situation in a simple and understandable way helps a lot with a kid developing a sense of empathy as they get older. I certainly got more from that show and PBS than I did TVland reruns.
When you realizee Ace and El from stranger things are the same person ... Hmmm
Holy fuck I have never felt like I've been hit by a baseball bat of feels like this before.

Pow....Right in the kisser....*sobs*
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING

I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS FEELS TRIP.
That was more intense than I was expecting.
This scene is why batman can hang with the gods in the justice league while only being a man himself. He has the right choice for every situation and knows how to best handle any scenario. The way he perfectly distracts and comforts ace into being able to calmly accept her fate and demise in a way where she won't destroy reality, it's amazing. I tear up every time I watch this scene. It's batman at his best.
My greatest fear is to feel death creep up on me, be in pain, and completely alone. Crawling out of my door begging for someone to just hold my hand but they shoo me off weirded out. Please universe don’t let this happen to me ): 
Well that wasn't funny at all.  I was waiting for a joke or something because I didn't check what subreddit it was from.
Batman is my favorite hero simply because he doesn't want others to the feel the pain and anguish he has so he wears a suit and becomes a symbol for others to stand behind. 
Might as well link a video instead
Back in the day, before these new edgier DC animated films were a thing, this was pretty groundbreaking.
The second he holds his hand out is what gets me.
Batman's greatest weapon: the feels.
His greatest power is being human. 
Shut up, you're crying
[deleted]
Mother fucker, I saw this on the front page wasn't sure what scene it was. I recognized it on the first frame now if you'll excuse me I have something in my eye. Thanks op it's a great scene 
The only thing I thought would have made this scene more powerful was if Batman took off his glove. It's a real tear jerker don't get me wrong but if he took his glove off before reaching out his hand I would have lost it.
I will upvote anything related to Batman Beyond!
DC cartoons are intense. 
That was heavy as shit. Awesome
Fuck man, I'm drunk and this shit made me cry man
I'm NOT crying! YOU'RE CRYING! 
If i even accidentally think of this, it hits me in thr feels.
Kevin Smith chokes up telling Kevin Conroy that this scene made him cry on his podcast Fatman on Batman. Its episode 11 and you should really listen to it.
Off, that one gets me every time.
Tearjerker 4 sure
This is what makes batman cool; his almost omnipotent wisdom. Something that none of the batman actors (major movies) could ever get right.
I know it would be a lot out of character, but I felt like he should take his cowl off at the end, I mean she knows who he is anyway.
HOW DOES THIS END?

I don't know anything about this show but damn this was a good clip! 
Holy feel trip, Batman!
1000% great writing, authentic characters with humanity
Still read this in Conroy's voice.
I cried.

Holy feels, Batman...that's tough to watch :(
Sorry guys but can someone tell me what movie/episode is this scene from?
Some things just need to be videos and not gifs.
There’s a reason why Batman, a mortal man, stands equal among gods. 
I never watched this series and just had to google the synopsis and now I'm holding back tears at my desk.  
I haven’t even watched the show, but man, the FEELS!
My wife just asked me why I'm crying. 
Stranger Things Season 3 
And what we get from Hollywood? Movies like BvS and suicide squad...
I’m on my period and this legit made me tear up hard 
I watched this while listening to Dreaming With A Broken Heart by John Mayer
I’m not crying! Someone put tears in my eyes....
I’m tearing up in a fucking Firestone rn
These days it's easy to forget he is BatMAN, a good person who tries to save people, all people.
This ranks right up there with the moment where Harley asks Bats why he's helping her, even though she's been nothing but trouble for him.

Batman simply replies with a forlorn smile, " I had a bad day once, too. "
I'm not crying shut up YOU'RE CRYING.
Can't seem to remember, why was it that she was going to die again? I haven't watched justice league since they were first put on Netflix. I actually thought batman went through with it. 
I hate you OP. These are tears of hate!
Better with audio

Why are these onions so dusty?
What episode is this?
This is what Batman is all about
One of the best descriptions of Batman I’ve heard is, “If you can imagine your version of Batman comforting a scared child as easily as you can imagine them beating up criminals, then you’ve done Batman correctly.”

Hence why I think The Batman (2022) hit the nail on the head. Batman is much more than just a symbol of fear; He’s the heart of Gotham.
Let's not forget that Alfred's a Badass!

Ever since he beat Supermans ass bare fisted I don't question Alfred
Didn't he rescue people from concentration camps in WWII?
What is the context of this panel?
wait, alfred will kill people and bruce is okay with that?
I'm really happy with the "First Ally" Arc in All Star. Alfred has ALWAYS been a bad ass, and it's nice to finally see an Alfred-centric story. 
Alfred is a badass

If I'm not wrong I believe this is from Booster Gold's 2007 series when he tried to break into the batcave to steal back some photos that the joker had of him.  The only proof that Booster was a hero, and not a zero.

Edit: I'm not wrong, it is from Booster Gold 2007!  Booster Gold solo series confirmed.  
Serious question, I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, but what is with the **seemingly random** bold letters in comics. I've always assumed it was to emphasize certain words to give the character more personality in how they're speaking, except when I emphasize those words in my head, it sounds stupid.
Alfred straight up murdered Penguin in Earth 1. 
I feel like emphasis should have been put on "master's" rather than "against"
Well, Alfred is a butler after all.  The butler's job is to answer the door, clean up the estate, and *take out the trash.*
That is why I love Alfred.
[Alfred shot a Predator once.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avp/images/4/4a/BatmanVsPredatorBook3-2-3.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140201090725) 

He doesn't mess around.  
I want to see a scene like this but with Aunt Harriet. 
Sauce? 
Best scenes in the Gotham series is Alfred kicking ass. 😄
Batman wasn't protecting Gotham from the bad guys. Batman was protecting the bad guys from Alfred.
He burned down a jungle because of tangerines.

Pretty sure this was done before. Giles from Buffy.

The way his dialogue is written... When you read it with my typical American accent, it sounds weird but when I give it that British tone to it and it sound very proper.

So, my question is: is this a style of speaking and writting? If so, what's it called? It can't be called "British English" or is it?
Isnt Alfred the joker in one continuity?
For anyone whos seen Gotham, one of my favourite quotes from him is "I'm not a cop, I'm a butler”, as he stabs a girl being interrogated by Gordon
Also " Reggie's a mate. You don't set coppers on your mates.... Anyone sorts him out, it's me." after Reggie stabs him

Alfred punching Deathstroke. Stone cold bad-ass. 
Recently played TellTale's Batman and seeing Alfred shoot Two-Face's thugs with a rifle in Wayne Manor was awesome.

New meme format?
Batman: "I've defeated you again, The Penguin."

The Penguin: "Ha! I know you. You won't kill me. I'll go to Arkham Asylum for a while, and then I'll just get out again like usual and keep doing what I do. Wagh wagh wagh."

Batman: "Correct. My own personal code of morality prevents me from killing. Alfred, will you please...*take out the trash???*

Alfred: "With pleasure, sir! *chk-chik*
I've always wanted an Alfred miniseries. The alternating between butler, superhero support, and bad ass would be great.
Speaking of Alfred's ass, is anyone else discomfited by the length (or lack thereof) of his arms?
What makes it scarier is (assuming this hasn’t changed) that Alfred is the one member of the Family that Bruce allows an exception to his One Rule.
Alfred on self defense.

[This is my favorite Alfred moment](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/legendsofthemultiuniverse/images/0/09/Alfred_the_badass.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150904204552). Not canon but still cool, from the otherwise ridiculously bad Injustice comics.
He will probably be my first pick when playing heroes in the upcoming [board game](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3840359.jpg).
If anyone reads the Discworld, this is very similar to Willikins, especially in Snuff. Amazing character. 
Hes the best butler in the history of butlers... BLESS MY DUSTPAN BATMAN
"We burned down the forest" -Alfred, giving zero shits
I'd love to see a pre-Wayne Family backstory for Alfred Pennyworth. The only butler type sidekick I can think of that's about as badass is Owen Burnett from Gargoyles.
Must have Jehovah's Witness' at the door again.
A series where Famous Gotham villians keep coming up murdered. Batman is on the trail only to find it’s Alfred slaying these evil doers to spare the Bruce the suffering.

Your butler guards your cave with a shotgun?
[deleted]
Yo who do you fuckers think taught Batman how to fight.
Is it just me or is that shotgun drawn a bit weird? It looks like an over/under double barrel at the breach but only one barrel appears to run the length of the gun.
I'd love an Alfred movie, so many crazy things happened in his life! 
Reminds me of Willikins.
Hush?
Sure we have had enough veneration of murder today?
That’s exactly what I say before calling “PULL!”
Very kind, sir. 
In Batman vs Predator, Alfred took a shotgun to P's face. It was awesome.
We both I have the same first name
Except for that time he was secretly the Joker.
They made him a badass in the telltale series game too, fuck yeah Alfred you’re a true M8 
Let me assure you SIR
Damnnn Alfred is THICC
Looked like was kneeling on a chair at first.
He was also a master archer in the 66 show
He is rational man with a shotgun.
This servant kills people... he's *BADASS*
Translation: “I pack that thang too so if you come this way you will get clapped”
An Alfred movie could be awsome. Apparently he has a great back story
this is just like the Buffy season 5 finale!
Can someone explain why comic books put emphasis on what seems like the wrong word?
My cocaine . 
Alfie you da bomb!
And he’s thicc too!
I never get the why they ephasize the words they do in these comics with bold italics. I'd think "master's" and "I" would be. The way it's written somehow sounds wrong in my mind.
Remember when he shot the fucking Predator with an elephant gun? Fun times. 
What comic is that frame from?
Alfred is my fucking favorite in every single piece of Batman media that I consume.
Alfred would whoop Batman's ass.  He even knows where the Batcave is. 
Ok serious question. Why tf people sayin superman strongest super hero when he got his ass handed to him by an old man??
I have sexual and emotional feelings for Alfred the butler. 
*Loads shotgun with malicious intent*
Let me assure you I subscribe to no such NICE TIES 👔
So often overshadowed by Heath Ledgers joker, but how fucking good was Aaron Eckhart as Twoface

If you want to see Aaron Eckhart at the top of his game, watch Thank You For Smoking. He manages to make you actually like a scumbag tobacco lobbyist. It's almost certainly the role that won him Harvey Dent.
Literally the perfect casting.
I thought he was amazing as Harvey dent, needed some more time as two face tho
Can we talk about how the CGI has not aged at all? 

It looked brilliant in 2008 and it looks brilliant now
Didn’t get the screen time as Two Face that he deserved. My only complaint with the whole movie.
No one from that movie‘s undrappreciated. There‘s just a few standouts. The  casting for this movie was brliliant.
Definitely underrated, the scene where he wakes up in the hospital and his scream is muted out always sends me chills.
Meh...he was 50/50.
He was fucking good as fuck.
[deleted]
He was brilliant. I wish they could make him Two Face for Keaton's Batman. Nolan made a huge mistake not bringing A.E. back.
He was great. The makeup effect was gnarly.
He was definitely better two face than Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever.
actor was good but story wise he's supposed to be bruce's friend. it felt like a cold war everytime bruce and dent met
He was amazing, doesn’t get enough credit
he was phenomenal, he really showed his acting skills in this film
I know, he was perfect. I was hoping for Guy Pierce at the time, but it wouldn’t have been nearly as good.
Amazing, especially for what the movie was goin for. Yea he wasn’t Two-Face for long and wouldn’t have lived long with those kinda burns anyway but he served the purpose he was supposed to
Aaron Eckhart is such an underrated actor.
That was a special movie
I just hate that he’s Two Face for all of 11 minutes before he dies
Good, but it was too brief.  He was Two Face for like 10 minutes before he died.  I was really hoping he was still alive but alas….
How did he survive so long with his flesh burned through to the bone? I'm not a doctor but it doesn't seem like you can go around with your head open that way
He was never overshadowed for me mate. He was just underutilized. If the dark knight had been 3 hours like the batman 2022 then he could have had a nicer more rounded arc. He was just as good as ledger but he just wasn't given enough screen time. He was forced in at the end when they needed at least another hour. To be honest hour and a half. Stop being afraid to make long movies Hollywood. Comic storylines take time. Either part 1 and 2 or a 3-4 hour long movie. That's my 2 cents
He was amazing.
It was so good and I have always held the opinion that we’d talk about it more if not for Ledger’a phenomenal performance.

In fact, when the third movie had a villain who was dispensing “Justice” and “punishment” in a cynically capricious manner on behalf of Bane, imagine my surprise that they didn’t use the villain that’s actually themed on the nature of chance versus purpose.
Was he good? I'm not sure. 

Could go either way.
Meh. He was an ok Harvey Dent, but Two Face's brutal/wild side didn't get enough play.
He was great. The writing for his character maybe not so much.
I met him personally at my Porsche dealership! Hes just as awesome of a person as he is Twoface. Freakin awesome! I would appreciate another movie with him.
I hear that this whole film was just an advertisement for Aaron Eckhart’s face. It was half off!
TWO FACE!!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HARVEY DENT AND SCARY FACE???? THEY’VE DONE NOTHING TO YOU!
I loved how brutal his design was and how slow and sinister he moved and talked. Always making you wonder what happens if he gets real mad
Have to disagree with you on that, chief. I came away from that movie, believing two-face was lame and boring only to find out, years later, that he's actually a fucking sick badass that can beat you to a bloody pulp while also giving you a lecture on why your life is shit and you made it so. Aaron's two-face is a good character, but much like a lot of things in TDK trilogy, not a good version of the character. At least, that's just my opinion. Idk, my takes on TDK trilogy gets a lot of hate from people and I've not met a single person who agrees with me except for my buddy Christian
He was amazing, it’s a shame they didn’t let him live longer as a bad guy
His whole performance as Harvey and Two-Face was great. Plus Two-Face looked incredible.
Always thought this was Sean Bean
The thing is that he didn't have enough screen time to be fully appreciated. He was good.
*”Half.”*
I had so hoped that the late appearance by Two Face meant the movie was setting him up to be the main villain of the next film. He was so good that I was bummed that it didn't last longer.
He was great, I wish we had gotten more of him! I would’ve liked it if he survived the end of DK and returned for another film.
The movie was running long by the time he was introduced. He deserved his own movie.
Oh man so good... He was so good at looking evil. He really was able to squint his eyes so much and turn his mouth upside down and look so bad and evil. And then the CGI artist were able to turn his face into a half face of evil. Amazing.
KWISPY
Aaron Eckhart is a gem.
You mean Elrond Feckfart?
Same as every other Gemini just two face
He hasn’t done anything close to good since unfortunately.
Loved him! He could have carried his own movie as the main villain
DAE Dar Knight masterpiece!???!????!!?
He should have gotten an Oscar for the hospital scene when he first wakes up
Not that good? He was okay, it was a fine performance but it would have been elevated if his character was written better. He's goes from 'hero' to villain far too quickly.
His origin in BTAS was much better and that was done in a shorter time, in a kids show.
Nice enough performance though. 
Nolan isn't really an actor's director to be fair, (hence not many acting awards or even nominations for his movies). I think you'd have to be quite an exceptional actor to put on a special performance in a Nolan movie (Ledger).
I think I've heard once that Nolan wasn't sure that he was making 3 movies so he put Joker amd Twoface in a single movie. If he had known he was making a trilogy then Twoface would have been the final villain
I still remember how powerful that first scene with him in the hospital bed was, when it almost shows a glimpse of his face but cuts away, and the horror and revulsion I felt a moment later when it showed his burned, scarred face fully for the first time.
I didn’t care for Heath ledger‘s joker. The best joker I thought was Jack Nicholson.
Yeah, totally went under the radar.
I dunno, his burnt face looks so weird and cgi-ish, not saying anything about performance though
I'm getting down votted  for this but he was the only best thing in that overrated movie
He first landed on my radar in Thank You For Smoking. Just an unfathomably talented actor.
Depends on what side of his performance you want to look at.
50/50 I could take it or leave it 🪙
I never dug this performance to be honest. It didn’t ruin the movie or anything, it wasn’t horrible. But it just didn’t sing like everything else did for me. I feel like the only one.
He should have been the movie's main antagonist, joker deserved his own movie like Bane did imo
"Please don't punish the boy. Punish me."   

"I'm about to."  

 Coldest line in movie history.
What's the name of this movie
I consistently tell people that bale’s Batman performance is the most boring and uninteresting part of the Nolan Batmans. Maybe it’s because the villains and gordan (in the first 2) are so good. But it’s hard for me to like those Batman movies when Batman is boring and doesn’t want to be Batman for most of the movies. 

But Eckhart is great and I’m surprised he doesn’t have a bigger career.
He was awesome, second favorite portrayal behind BTAS

The Arkham games did a VERY good job with two-faces’s character but was criminally underutilized in the game’s narratives so that portrayal loses points for that
(not about the actor, but about the character in the movie) He was the main character of the Dark Knight, not batman.

Often people say Christopher Nolan doesn't do character development. I present to you, character development. A man who makes choices in an effort to stop the joker, and ultimately fails, in fact goes more than failing, and switches sides entirely. He starts believing in Gotham's best interest, by the end he believes nothing matters and the joker is right. His final action was the coin flip to decide whether to shoot the kid- only stopped by Batman (in his final decision). Throught the movie Harvey had to balance between stopping the joker and trusting in a vigilante because the Gotham police simply didn't have the tech to stop the joker.
I hated it. It's not Eckhart's doing, but Nolans script. He wasn't two face, he was just an angry guy with a messed up face.

The tragedy of two face is that Harvey dent is still there, but the trauma has created his duplicitous personality that can override his "justice through honor" with "justice through vengeance". It gets even more gnarly when his DUALITY OCD makes for insane perceptions of his world and outcomes. Bruce knows Harvey is in there wrestling against two-face, which is what earns him a high grade in the rogues gallery.

Eckhart is a great actor, but he's no two face. And it's pretty dumb talking such an amazing character and attempting to cram it into the 3rd act...Two Face deserves  better.
Best on screen two face ever IMO
Everytime I eat baby back ribs I see his face
I honestly would prefer seeing Two-Face, as well as other famous Batman villains on the big screen instead of the Joker. Joker is a great character, he really is. But sometimes it feels like he is forced/shoehorned in everything Batman. 

Like there are really good villains that has appeared in other projects. Scarecrow in Begins (probably my favorite Batman movie), Bane in TDKR, Riddler in The Batman 2022. Gotham was a good show with compelling characters. Even when Jerome wasn't present. 

Heck, similar to "Joker" I want to see the Riddlers story with references to other villains.
He was good. He was just unfortunately barely in the damn movie once he became Two-Face.
One of the best parts of the movie.
honestly, not that good.
Can we stop posting this weekly holy fucking shit
I've watched this movie so many times, and am now just seeing how his nose looks
I remember being extremely disappointed that he died at the end and wasn’t going to be back for the sequel. The movies ending is damn near perfect but imagine if the last scene of the movie was the Joker hanging upside down saying Harvey was his ace and then that is the cliff hanger for the third movie.
So good. That trilogy had great villains (not you “Talia”)
we get it the actors were good this movie is old news make new posts
Not very imo… the “RACHEL” scream makes me giggle still
His performance was great, that version of the character, not so much, the same goes for Heath Ledgers Joker.
IMHO he didn't have enough screentime. In his other iterations he was a mob boss.  We got lots of Harvey Dent, but he died like 10 minutes after becoming two face.
A person missing half his face/cheek/lip structure could not properly speak the way he does in this movie. I give whoever was in charge of realistically representing how his speech would sound a -10 ! 

So I guess this isn’t the actors fault, but I can’t even focus when a person without lips can say p’s and b’s properly. 😭
The entire cast was fantastic. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Chin Han, Gordon's detectives, the gangsters, all of them.

My only reservation was Michael Caine as Alfred. Nothing against Caine, he just didn't have the right look or sound, IMO.
I'll give him a solid 'Eh!'. Forgettable, even without Ledger.
Best superhero movie of all time imo. I don’t know if it can be topped. It would be like toppling lord of the rings for a fantasy film.
"This isn't about what's right, it's ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR."
SAY IT!!
Frankly, when all was said and done, his Two Face was much closer and loyal to the source materials than the Joker in his behaviors, and he deserved to NOT DIE. He was excellent in the part
He was the best actor in that movie period
He was like Cam in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. A movie that has a main character as the titular person, but then steals the show with his story & performance. Harvey Dent’s final monologue at the end of the movie is so good.

“You thought we could be decent men, in an INDECENT time!”
I would love to see Aaron Eckhart return as Two Face in The Batman sequels
Terrible.
He was the best part of the whole series.
He's definitely in my top 3 favourite performances for the character.
The story of the Dark Knight is essentially the story of Harvey Dent, not Joker, not Batman. It follows the basis of the long halloween, which again is the story of Harvey Dent.

And I think they executed him perfectly.
Why was he called two face tho? he is half face to me.
I know this is overly nitpicky perhaps, but as good as his performance was, I hated the creative decision to have half his face a basic flesh skeleton. The guy wouldn't be able to survive with that bad of tissue damage and he would die from infection and nerve damage, let alone not being able to blink. He should have had gruesome burns and scars sure, but they way over did it in my opinion.
Not that good, honestly.
Should've used Shia Labiaouf.
Anyone else think Heath Ledger his HIGHLY overrated as joker?  I just find his delivery very strange and a bit....droll.
[deleted]
I always thought for a live action setting the effect was made far too literal. The clean line straight down the middle just looks off.
Wish they went with Two Face entirely instead of Joker tbh.
Horrible
I hated the “make up”.  It ruined it for me.
Worst part of the movie. Aaron sucks
Worst part of the movie
I didn't like that plotline
He was at least 500,000 good. If it was anyone other than Heath as Joker, Aaron would have won that Oscar.
Facts
Half as good
He did an insane job. He never gets the recognition he deserves. You really get where he’s coming from and why he loses it.
Amazing make up and effects. I have a hard time looking at him, honestly.
I loved everything about it. I just hate how rushed it feels by the end (and maybe the design of the scarring) It should have been the focus of Rises, imo, instead of the silly league of shadows back for vengeance plot. If anyone is a sympathetic villain, I feel it’s this take on Dent and would have made for a great finale if they expanded on that.

Edit: I also think it was pretty good at exploring the whole “use the system to change the system” approach.
He was actually my favorite in the entire movie his range of Rage was so on point
Best part of the movie foe me. He was the star for me. Gotham destroying the real hero. He should've been the real antagonist in the 3rd movie.
This was one of the strongest instances in super hero movies that I was bummed by the one-move-villain trope. Felt like there was a lot of potential there.
He also played Two-Face freaking great. They should have put in him 3 so that way it makes Arkham Asylum  Batman
definitely liked Tommy Lee Jones's two-face a lot better but Aaron eckhart did a good job
"IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR!"
SO much better than Ledger. This is the performance that deserved the Oscar they handed to Ledger. Or maybe they just gave it to his next of kin? Not sure how that works. Where does the Oscar go when it's awarded posthumously?
He was not half bad!
Amazing actor, perfect casting. How the hell is he still able to speak coherently? They jumped the shark on the cgi. It's campy AF compared to the relative believability of literally the entire rest of the franchise.
The whole cast was overshadowed tbh and they’re amazing in the film. I still can’t get over that Bale and Oldman aren’t American yet they literally changed their accents to fit their roles. I know that might not seem like a lot, but most actors who try different accents tend to f’ up the role (see that Versace movie…yikes). And yes Eckhart is fantastic as Twoface. He shares the screen with Oldman, Bale, and Ledger yet he manages to hold his own. What a great film.
I liked it. I know the whole script would have to have been altered but I wish we would have seen two face earlier in the film.
Is it wrong of me that he was my favorite performance of the film? Like I rly enjoyed heath but damn I loved this performance so much more
I loved it as well, and I love how he played it true to the comic books, in a dark conflicted way, as opposed to Tommy Lee Jones more joker like rendition.
I wish he had the next movie to himself and not die to quickly in Dark Knight
I think it’s still my favorite design/look/costume (obviously the face is CGI) for any villain in a CBM. It’s simple, however it perfectly covers everything you need to know about Harvey just by looking at him.
I am still under impression how well was that CGI face made. It still looks very real after almost 15 years.
You make a fair point. Not many people appreciate this rendition of two face and its truly impressive.
Brilliant
Everyone in that movie was spot-on
I didn't like the way the character was represented. While the whole movie takes a somewhat realistic approach to the Batman franchise his character looked too cartoonish to me. Also his storyline felt rushed and like an unnecessary addition.
True very good point OP. Underrated and doesn’t get the plaudits he deserves. I don’t really think any work of art is ever perfect but this movie comes damn well close and the casting of the other characters like Two Face, and performances of Oldman and Kane in addition to Batman and Joker really tie it all together
Amazing choice
SO over “super” hero shit.
i said it when it came out and ill say it now. ledgers performance was nowhere near as good as eckharts and he only got an oscar because he died.
i just wish we got more of two face
the whole movie was fucking perfect.

one of my most favorite films
My favorite tidbit about him is that he based a lot of his portrayal on Robert F. Kennedy. And yeah, it fits very well.
Such a poor character. His motivation was so contrived.
It’s a shame we got him for what felt like 2 scenes
I was in this movie.
I thought Heath was the only good thing about this movie the rest was just wasted potential and a terrible gravely batman voice.
Everyone were perfect in their roles.
Spot on for the batman animated version too, that raspy slow talking.
“It’s not about what I want, it’s about what’s FAIR!!”
When he wakes up in the hospital bed and there's no sound but you can hear his screams of anguish in your head. Brilliant.
I feel his arc got bolted on at the end when the movie had already peaked, and his scenes as two face could have been set up better and came out a bit corny. But I think the choice of actor was great.
For real! He was so good!
Man was built like Gus Fring
Only half as good, at best.
I just always think he would be dead pretty quick from infection
I love heath but i often  find that compared to Tom hardy  in my opinion he just wasn’t as good,still phenomenal but not Tom hardy good,Aaron comes close third
Eckhart is a wonderful actor. And a wonderful man in general as far as i know.
This guy with half a face was the only thing that threw me off a bit when watching. Like, wouldn't he be in immense pain? Or how do his eyes stay in place?
"The only morality in a cruel world is chance. Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair."

When the only way to communicate how you feel is to put them through the same thing you experienced. It's basically school shooter logic.

You really feel like he's lost everything and has nothing left but to show Gotham how he feels.
Agreed, he’s great. It’s just that scene in the hospital where he only [recognizes](https://youtu.be/EhoWj4gEpwU) the Joker once he takes off the surgical mask. Always makes me piss myself. 

‘Oh hi nurse…wait a goddamn minute’
Everyone they cast in this movie really fit the role and looked like they were from gotham
try to say batman with that mouth
kind of cool
SAY IT!!
The effect is great, his acting was pretty bad
Very good point
He was Two Face for 5 minutes without doing anything and then he died.
One of the most dissappointing things about TDK was that almost the whole plot was about Harvey Dent, and then he only became Two Face for about five minutes* before dying. What a waste.

**if you look up compilation videos on youtube, his screen time as Two Face is literally less than 5 minutes.*
Absolutely phenomenal
He’d have been great if he was given his own film/or was used for 3. His turn from Harvey to Twoface is just crammed into an already busy 3rd act.
Heath sucked, he acted like a lizard they gave him the Oscar because he overdosed.  He did ok but Jack was way better
Meh.
Both actors handled their villains beautifully.
It’s not about what I want, it’s about what’s FAIR!
Scary face...what have you done with Harvey?!
I like Joaquin Pheonix Joker better than them both
Poor guy will never work again after Frankenstein
He didn't have the high ground
Really fucking good!
Loved him. As both Harvey and two face. Don't think he's over-shadowed as such just that Heath's part was bigger and his character more iconic. Two fantastic performances for sure. Won't be long till someone from a Nolan movie gets an Oscar for acting. Looking forward to Oppenheimer.
Finally somebody gives this man his due. He killed it as Two Face.
It was an epic film. They all smashed it
I've always said if Heath Ledger hadn't died Aaron Eckhart would have got the Oscar and not been destined to star forever in schlocky disaster movies
"but how fucking good was Aaron Eckhart as Twoface" ...SAY IT !!!!!!! (iykyk)
I’m waiting for 2-face to have his own movie🤧💯
Harvey Dent, can we trust him?!?!
Name stealing sonovabitch
Aaron Eckhart is good in everything.
I thought the worst party of the movie was his Two-Face, whether it was his acting or the writing, idk
Its gus!!!!!!1111!!
Overshadowed because ledgers joker was the best
Whitewashed Gus Fring
Hurts that they killed him off so quickly 😔
I really wish that Nolan had saved Two-Face for the 3rd movie. Eckhart should have gotten his moment in the sun.
He was okay as Two-Face, his makeup was amazing though
I love his little growls when he gets mad. It's like a distinction of his other half, the aggressive side.

Bad
Unpopular opinion but Aaron’s acting was just as  impressive if not better than Heath
He kinda sucked, that part where he screams Rachels name over and over when she dies ALWAYS makes me laugh, but he is trying to be serious.
Where's he been?
The Joker and Two Face were the only good parts about Nolans trilogy.
Why isn't this guy in everything? He's awesome. Even in Battle: Los Angeles
The corniest, most convoluted character in that movie.
So good I forgot he was in the movie until just now.
I'm going to disagree with this one. The actor was fine for the role he was playing, but I did not care for this origin story of Two Face nor his role within the larger movie's narrative.
Literally perfect Two-face. Really captures the Long Halloween version of Two-Face. Have to admit Cillian Murphy's scarecrow was also quite underused within the trilogy.
Kevin Conroy has passed.

RIP. He'll always be Batman's voice to me.
This is a absolutely devastating. RIP to the voice of my childhood, awkward teen years, and into my adult life. There is no one better who has voiced the man behind the mask.
So here's my Kevin Conroy story.

I used to live in Manhattan just south of Central Park.  I was jogging one night with my dog and I run into a guy walking his 2 dogs. They were older dogs, but friendly, and our dogs stop for a sniff.

I start chatting with this dude as you do when your dogs are hanging out.  I recognize him...but I can't place him.  After a few minutes I ask "I'm sorry I recognize you from something, but I can't quite place it."

"I'm Kevin Conroy.  I voiced Batman."

Holy.  Shit.

I was speechless.  After what felt like an eternity I said "Holy crap....you ARE Batman. I grew up on the series.  It's so awesome to meet you! I can't tell you how influential you are to me. That show is a huge reason why I'm in the film/TV industry."

"Thanks.  Also..." and he does the voice "I'm BATMAN."

Coolest dude ever.  RIP, Kevin.
He was THE Batman voice for multiple generations, and a very inspirational figure.
https://batman-news.com/2022/11/11/kevin-conroy-death/

From Warner Brothers Discovery press release

>“Kevin was perfection,” recalled Mark Hamill, who redefined the Joker playing opposite Conroy’s Batman. “He was one of my favorite people on the planet, and I loved him like a brother. He truly
cared for the people around him – his decency shone through everything he did. Every time I saw him or spoke with him, my spirits were elevated.”


>“Kevin was a brilliant actor,” Hamill said. “For several generations, he has been the definitive Batman. It was one of those perfect scenarios where they got the exact right guy for the exact right part, and the world was better for it. His rhythms and subtleties, tones and delivery – that all also helped inform my performance. He was the ideal partner – it was such a complementary, creative experience. I couldn’t have done it without him. He will always be my Batman.”
Now you can rest in peace Master Bruce.
This news hit me different than any other actor or voice actor death news 

The only Batman voice in my mind and what i hear when i read comics ... I am  heartbroken
"I AM VENGANCE, I AM THE KNIGHT, I AM BATMAN!"

Rest in peace to a legend
Holy shit my heart just dropped. RIP to the Definitive Batman.
66 should not be a age where you die. Fuck illnesses.
I...I...I just don't know what to say.  
  
This is legitimately gutting for me. A man who defined a character, a character that defined me in many ways, and carried the spirit of the character through so much...such a kind, compassionate, soul who has gone through so much before he finally achieved the legendary status he deserved.  
  
RIP Kevin Conroy. You were Vengeance. You were the Night. You were Batman. But you were also yourself.
I'm gutted. He's been the voice of batman since I was a kid. I'm utterly shocked. 

It is in poor taste that people are arguing over this being a hoax and refusing to believe it. More sites are now reporting his passing.

He is vengeance. He is the night. He is batman.
I got a cameo message from Kevin last year as a gift. It was the greatest gift I have ever received. That man spoke to me as a friend, as a mentor and then at the end as Batman. I listen to it whenever I need a pep talk. I idolized that voice growing up and the man behind it exceeded everything.

Rest in peace Mr. Conroy.
I cannot begin to impress how sad this makes me. He was such a selfless man too. He told this story at a convention a few years ago:

"After the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, Conroy helped out in the relief efforts by volunteering to do cooking duties for officers and firefighters. On the Batman: Gotham Knight DVD's commentary, he told the story about it, and how another cook found out he was the voice of Batman. He asked if he could tell everyone, and Conroy agreed, though he thought no one would even know who he was. At the other cook's urging, Conroy yelled in the voice of Batman, "I am vengeance! I am the night! I... am... Batman!" (a line he had famously delivered in the episode "Nothing to Fear" from Batman: The Animated Series) eliciting cheers from the first responders eating at the relief center. They began telling him what their favorite episodes were, and how they had watched the show with their kids. He said it was the first time he had seen any of them smile or laugh since the attacks a week earlier"

Going to miss that man.
Well that sucks.
Dude what the HELL
Im starting to see more tweets about it. RIP Venegence.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
He was the nicest man I had a chance to meet at a con.  Most stars are exhausted from travel and meeting everyone, but he was genuinely humble and thankful of everyone at his table.
Well, this broke my heart. RIP to the Batman. To anyone mourning this news, I suggest looking into the comic that Kevin wrote about his experience as a gay man, and how he related those life experiences to his experiences playing Bruce Wayne and his alter ego. It warmed my heart and made me love this man even more. It’s called “Finding Batman”
Damn

Lost my dad

Lost my dog

Now I’ve lost my favorite voice actor

Fucking 2022 man 😭
Kevin went through a lot of struggle because of his sexuality. I feel like you all should read this:

[Finding Batman -  Written by voice actor Kevin Conroy, about his hidden struggles as a gay actor before becoming the Dark Knight](https://imgur.io/gallery/LFZttru)
Fun story about Kevin. 

Years ago (9 years, I think) my friends had just gotten engaged. We'd just recently read about a couple randomly asking Jason Segel to officiate their wedding, which he did, and had been talking about how cool getting someone famous like that to officiate would be. 

Both of them are HUGE Batman fans, especially the animated series. Kevin Conroy was a hero to them. So I reached out to him via Twitter, told him a longer version of this story, and asked him if there was any chance he might officiate. 

He responded fairly quickly saying that while he was honored, he wasn't the one to officiate their wedding but he'd like to send them something for their wedding. So I gave him my address, and he ended up sending a lovely signed photo and a recording of him playing piano and singing The Long and Winding Road!! 

Gave it to them, and played the song for them on their wedding day and they were absolutely over the moon. A year or two later we went to one of the comic cons in Dallas where they got to meet him, and he remembered the whole thing and signed a wedding invite they'd brought along to connect all the dots! 

Long winded way of saying Kevin was an awesome and thoughtful guy. We'll miss you!
Damn man…That’s such a bummer.
Geez man...I'm sick.
That’s a downer.  Watched Batman everyday after school…
To the man who voiced the most iconic character ever, Thank you for the memories!!
I don't know what to say... RIP Conroy
His death date was just added to his wikipedia's page and all mentions of the word is (for example "he is best known as the voice of batman) was changed to was ("he was known as the voice of batman)

Not saying this confirms it at all but just something I found out.

Edit: the story is on many news sites now and google has updated to show his death date when you look his name up.
No no no no no

He is Batman.
Is this legit??
You were vengeance. You were the night. You were *the* Batman.

RIP Kevin Conroy.
This really hurts my heart. I’m in tears right now. Growing up, Batman was everything for me. 

The Animated Series was what made me fall in love with Batman. I’d watch every episode again and again. Even today, I’ll put in the Blu-Ray and I’m immediately transported back into my childhood. I’d play with the action figures after school and it was Kevin Conroy’s voice in my head. 

This year has felt very hurtful. Being a Batman fan we’ve lost Neil Adams, Tim Sales and Kevin Conroy. These are the figures that have defined the character in my eyes, and they certainly defined parts of my childhood. 

This year I’ve been battling how it feels like the end of an era for me. I’m in No Man’s Land — unable to go backwards, but saying goodbye to who I once was is too difficult. This feels like one more reason I can never go back to who I used to be, with the people I once held so dear. Kevin Conroy’s Batman gave me the strength to move through hard times, and it hurts knowing we will never hear another line from this great man. 

Kevin Conroy reached greater heights than a voice actor. He was more than just the voice of Batman. He embodied the character in every facet. Rest in Peace and may your family have the strength to move through this tough period.
The Batman has passed away. 

But he'll live on as the voice in our heads while we read.
I feel like I just got punched in the chest, what the fuck
Well fuck
I'm surprised this hasn't hit the news yet, but it's likely everyone is trying to confirm with Conroy's family themselves before running it. But, he definitely looked ill within the past year or two so I'm inclined to believe this.
I’m shook. So crazy. I know he’d been getting fewer and fewer casts at Batman and I could only assume it was health related, but to know he’s really gone. It’s…it’s gonna take time to grasp it right.
Is this true?! I can't even. The truest Batman to ever live. Fucking grew up listening to this guy's voice.

He's a legend, always will be.

I can't believe it. I won't believe it. Noooo!
Christ, we lost another Batman.

I lost my Batman.☹
I think there isnt a single Batman fan who isnt gutted by this news. I also think there isnt a single Batman fan who doesnt hear his voice in his head when they see anything Batman related...just utterly saddened by this.
His will always be the voice I hear when I read the comics. Conroy’s Batman was so instrumental to me as a young gay kid. It gave me someone who fought injustice when I needed a hero most. And to learn there was a proud gay man behind one of the most iconic iterations of Batman, well, how can you thank someone enough for inspiration and pride? I hope he knew what he gave to this world. And I hope he heard the thanks enough ❤️🌈
You're kidding right? Because it's not funny like at all.
I Can’t find any confirmation on this?


Edit: it’s official. Rest In Peace King.
My girlfriend just got me the Lego Batman head sculpt set for my birthday, and in the middle of building it my brother texted me this news.

Suddenly this set has a lot more meaning now. Whenever I think of Batman, his is the voice that I hear in my head. RIP to my favorite Batman actor, who has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment, support and even moral lessons throughout my childhood. 

I'll miss him.
![gif](giphy|Q6sH2gX14Ow0QPl2QD|downsized)
In tears at this dude going around to reply on every single comment and let them know he thinks it’s fake
I’m stunned. Grateful for the way his tremendous body of work touched my life but deeply saddened that he wasn’t able to enjoy a longer life. His voice will never fade from my mind or my heart.
Man what the fuck. My heart hurts.
Fuck me that is awful. RIP you fucking legend
Voice of my childhood

![gif](giphy|4eGUxJc4lplh6)
He may not have been everyone's Batman, but he was *my* Batman. He set the bar for Batman and Bruce Wayne, and he set it high.

Rest easy, Dark Knight.
![gif](giphy|Sid4QgwDxJ8l2)

May he rest in peace
Kevin Conroy was a classically trained performer who trained under a master thespian at the Julliard Performing Arts School. He played the role of Hamlet in his youth and was a character player in several shows such as Dynasty, where he played a gay man in the mid 80s, at the height of the AIDS pandemic.

Kevin was a beautiful man who transformed the role of Batman like few could. He approached it as a twofold role, playing different voices for Bruce and Batman, and his trademark gruffness as Batman was so good it's the definitive voice for an entire generation.

Every actor following him, live action, animated, or polygon, has lived in the shadow of the Bat, and every voice carries some echo of Kevin forevermore now.

I truly hope he knew how much he was loved, because he will be missed so dearly.
Damn it. RIP Best Batman. The whole reason I got into Batman was seeing the Animated Series when it aired when I was around 5.
RIP. I’m going to watch Beware the Gray Ghost today.
I haven't felt so hurt by an actor's passing since Robin Williams. He will always be the definitive Batman to me and the voice I hear when I read Batman's dialogue. He was a great actor and from everything I've heard, a very kind person in general. I'm definitely going to be watching Mask of the Phantasm tonight
No way man
This is how the Batman died…
Rest in peace legend😔
No one will EVER even be able to get close to portraying Batman as well as Conroy. Batman is Kevin, let us always honor his legacy
I am devastated. I have always looked up to Batman as a child and as an adult I looked up to my Batman, Kevin. He was the one that made me feel comfortable being who I am and being able to come out as gay. If he could be Batman and be so strong and come out I felt that I could to.

It is because of Kevin and Batman: TAS i am who I am today. I will be playing the Arkham games and watching BTAS all weekend in his honor.
On Veteran’s Day too… he was always such an advocate for them
The world has lost another legend.

Rest now, Dark Knight
"An anchor. A safe harbor. A sense of safety. A sense of identity."

Thank you for all that you gave us, Dark Knight.
Posted about this on IG already so incredibly sad to hear. The only voice I read in for the comics and Mark Hamill as the Joker always. Literally my iconic Batman and the one I grew up with.
I’m shocked, because I literally just heard his voice two minutes ago while reading Injustice Y3…

Kevin Conroy will always be the Batman I hear when I’m reading comics, same as Mark Hamill’s Joker. 

They’ll go down in history as the real Dynamic Duo.

So sad. But what a life well-lived. 

He was Vengeance. He was the Night. He’ll always be Batman.
Fuck. He IS Batman. It’s fun to argue who has the best screen portrayal, but to me it comes down to who’s voice you hear whenever you read Batman dialogue. Kevin has and will always be that voice for me.
🥺😢 RIP to the iconic voice of Batman
I'm more upset about this than my breakup. Kevin Conroy was an absolute legend.
Fuuuck.

Rest in peace, the greatest Batman actor of all time.
RIP.  His voice for Batman will always be the standard for me
I’m broken hearted. 

I’m so lucky I got to meet him. It was at Comicon in London when I was stationed there. My wife and I got in line and was jokingly like “Looks at all these nerds waiting to meet Batman. Baby, when I get up there I’m not gonna be like him. Imma be cool as the other side of the pillow. Imma get my autograph and move on.” 

I got up there and I was like “Hey Mr Conroy I’ve love your work since I was a kid.” He said “Thanks so much that means a lot to me” 

And I paused and then I said “You know, the Animated Series made me a lifelong Batman fan.” “That’s awesome!  Should I include your name on this?” I was like “Sure! Also when I was deployed I played Arkham Asylum and Arhkam City like 4 times through EACH. You know, there’s a lot of Batman’s but you’re like THE Batman you know! There’s no other voice that fits Batman like your’s. You’re amazing.”

As we walked away my wife was like “You really showed him how not-nerdy you are, I was impressed.”

Rest Well Batman
This sub should change image to the animated Batman that Kevin voiced. It would be a small tribute, but a deserved remembrance if you ask me.

RIP Kevin. However he would know surely as well as we do, that the Batman he breathed life into with his voice will live on forever.
I can’t believe he’s gone. 
So I’m glad I got his autograph a couple years ago. 

And I’m even more glad that I’ve been fortunate enough to have gotten the chance to go to his panels at New York Comic Con.

There will never be a Batman voice actor like him ever again. And despite what people say, about other Batman voice actors. HE HAD THE DEFINITIVE BATMAN VOICE!
My dream was to see him play old man Bruce Wayne in a live action Batman Beyond.

RIP to the best to ever don the cape and cowl, even if it wasn’t donned literally.
Everytime I read a Batman comic, it's Kevin's Batman voice that i hear when I read Batman's dialogue. It will always be his voice so I will hear till the day I die.

RIP Kevin and thank you!!!
To me, more than any actor Kevin Conroy IS Batman. Yes, every live action actor brings something to the table but in totality Conroy embodied everything about that character. It just goes to show that voice work IS acting. This is a truly sad day in the Batman community. He brought so much joy to all of us.

I saw recent video of Conroy a couple months ago and he was looking pretty rough. The pain or illness he was suffering is over. He can now rest peacefully in Heavenly Grace. 

R.I.P. Kevin Conroy
My first ever action figure was a 1990 Kenner DC Comics Batman with winged jet pack that I talked my mom into buying for me because I thought Batman was the coolest.  I kept collecting more and more Batman toys after that.  I watched every animated series and movie and had Batman this and that for years.

Kevin was the voice I always associated with him and right now there's a deep sadness within the pit of my heart that is so far beyond tears and is just raw emotion that I can't quite articulate it at all.

So here's my favorite scene with him:  [Batman and Ace](https://youtu.be/YOooJW5SSDA)

Hugs to anyone else that's hurting today because of this and all the love in the world to those who need it.
I always enjoyed Kevin Conroy's work. I have the entire Batman the animated series on DVD all seasons. I also have the movie The killing joke with him in it. RIP Kevin Conroy. 😪
There are two images. The other is from Diane Perishing's fb, She was the voice of Ivy and I'm inclined to believe her.

No no no
Someone tell me this is just a hoax 😢
This better not be real news. That’s awful. I guess we don’t know the cause yet?
Rip to an absolute legend
If this is true, I'm so sad. I know a lot of people grew up watchig BTAS, and it was one of the first Batman things I watched as a kid too.
a catastrophic loss for an entire generation.

&#x200B;

Rest in Peace.
This hit me like a brick
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Dude I can't believe this, there's been so many other people voicing batman the past years but Kevin is iconic, he's THEE BATMAN. I'm honestly speechless
No no no nooooooo!!!
No one, and I mean no one has come anywhere close to legendary iconic status of his Batman. It is impossible to read Batman in anything but his voice
Why you gotta break my heart :'-(
just fuck my day up
Holy fuck. I thought this was a joke at first :(
I don't usually get upset about celebrity deaths but this one hurts.
They need to archive his voice for future use. I can’t go on without his sweet sweet voice
The building pillar of my love for superheroes, comic books, pop-culture has fallen down.
Wow this guy was my childhood and favorite superhero.  Floored.
Day is ruined. RIP.
The man was MY Batman as a kid and as I grew to play the games later as an adult. He was the Bat before the stupid “who’s better” convos. Most the famous lines we all know, he spoke. The man made the Bat what we all love. Rest In Peace
[This](https://youtu.be/g4PwNyJOjfU) is my favorite clip of his from BTAS. He does the Bruce Wayne voice while dressed as Batman and it's way weirder than you'd expect.
Genuinely on the verge of tears right now..... the amount of influence this man had on my childhood and the man I am today is more than I can express. The world is a lot bleaker now.... but he made it a whole lot brighter for me over all.

![gif](giphy|B4jfJqiIxvU08)
2 Celebrity deaths have actually made me sad

Christopher Ayres, the incredible voice of Freeza. He made Freeza my dragon ball favourite character.

And now Kevin Conroy THE Batman

At least for Ayres, his protégé Daman Mills can fill those massive shoes. And for someone like Mark Hamills incredible and de facto Joker voice, Troy Baker does an (imo) almost as good with his own style to it. 

But for Batman? No one comes close to Conroy. He is the only actor to ever understand Batman and Bruce Wayne, the only one that got his intelligence but also his darkness and sense of justice, some have come close in some of these areas but no one ever mastered all these aspects like him and so naturally as well. I can only hope for AI to improve enough for him to be truly immortalised as Batman forever
Goodbye, Kevin.
RIP Kevin Conroy.

Fuck Cancer seriously man. I lost my father earlier this year because of this damn disease too. He's 65 and Now this? 2023 really sucks for me.
Met him twice, once in 2015 and the other in 2016, the first time was around the time the convention was about to end, they were already packin up and everything so I anxiously approached him with my Dad and he was so unbelievably nice, he insisted that we all took a picture, free of charge and even signed a free photo for my brother who couldn’t make it, luckily my brother did get to meet him the next year. I’ll never forget how amazing he was and how he was the voice of my childhood, RIP
Bro. this guy will forever be vengeance, he will forever be the night, he will forever be Batman. even death he's in a better place. And nobody does it better than Conroy😭 I don't care if you got Robert Affleck or even freaking bale. They don't do it better than Kevin this guy will forever be the OG Batman and that's facts.

 RIP KEVIN CONROY (OG BATMAN) you will be missed at least by me 😭😢
I was in kindergarten when Batman TAS debuted so this hit me like a ton of bricks as he’s been Batman most of my life and I always imagine him saying Batman’s dialogue when I read comics. I never got a chance to talk or get a picture with 1-on-1 with him but I go to see him with Will Friedle and Lauren Tom at a Batman Beyond 20th anniversary panel at NY Comic Con a few years ago and it was pretty surreal to be in the same room as him.
Man, this one hurts. He was THE Batman. I met him at a Con a little over a year ago, and he was such a friendly and open guy.
Absolutely heartbroken. RIP Kevin Conroy.
I was devastated by the news. Slowly healing. I should've kept in touch more. He will be missed. Definitive Batman.
[deleted]
Wait what??!!?!
Rest In Peace BATMAN!
No 🥺
Devastated
Rip batman
RIP KEVIN CONROY 💔 TRUE LEGEND 🫡
Holy shit. I hope not. He’s absolutely iconic
Fuck man. He's was voice of generations of batman. When I think animated batman I think of him.
I don’t think I’ll take this news very well..you were my hero Kevin. Rest in Peace.
Met the man in 2015, he was very kind and gracious. Funny story it was at a small con in a casino conference room and me and my brother were looking for his booth and we couldn't find it in the sea of people and then we heard a booming voice "I AM BATMAN". We both just turned to each other and said "oh shit!" and made our way towards his voice. I shook his hand and said thanked him for being my Batman.
Omg… no…
No fucking way. I never thought I’d be here for the day. I’m even more devastated it happened so soon. Rest in Peace, the goat
Heart broken over this, devastating news
Well this was a total gut wrench.

Now I’m sad.

Rest In Peace Caped Crusader.
Damn man, I wonder what happened. He seemed like a healthy guy and 66 isn't that old.

All the same RIP if this is true.
Rest in peace Kevin, you made so many lives so much better
I can't believe it..........

R.I.P. to our childhood hero 💔
He will always be Batman.
I may have different opinion of my favorite Bruce Wayne’s but Kevin Conroy is the voice of Batman. What an awful loss. So sad.
Rest in piece Kevin, you will forever be remembered
I am trying not to cry while in this work meeting because this hurt my heart BAD. RIP Kevin Conroy, we love you
And just like that, my depressions back
This has been a rough year for Batman fans.
Well my day just got a whole lot shittier.
My favorite memory of Comic Con was him and the voice of Harley on a panel, going back and forth in character. 

Definently a sad day if it turns out to be true
Damn this hits pretty hard...kind of a wierd parallel that gotham knights starts with a dead bruce. Batman the animated series is obviously legendary but his work in the arkham series rivals most movies.
Omfg. Wow. I am speechless. First Leslie Jordan, now this, those who I grew up watching are leaving this earth. I guess this is what aging is...
This hurt me like when Jessica Walter died.

Kevin Conroy is my ideal Batman and I’m going to miss him. I feel like I lost someone I knew personally. I’m grateful we had him for as long as we did.
Fuck.........

Rest in peace Kevin the greatest Batman there ever was.
This fucking sucks. R.I.P. Mr. Conroy
the goat bro rip
At this point, it’s too late but I just thought about it. I really wish Kevin Conroy got to be like the Stan Lee of Batman movies. I know he didn’t create the character, but I think for most of us he IS (not was) the character, and it would’ve been cool to see him make little cameos in all the Batman movies
I seems unreal, man. I remember sitting in front of the tv on saturday mornings watching reruns of Batman TAS on Toonami. That was my first real introduction to Batman as a character. 

Prayers to his family and friends. RIP Kevin Conroy.
NOOOOOOOOOOO
This sucks so fucking bad. I don’t think any other celebrity death has hit me so hard. What an absolute gut punch. RIP to a legend and the voice of my childhood
There will never be a more definitive voice for Batman than Kevin Conroy. RIP.
RIP Kevin Conroy. Way too young to go. He will be remembered as the definitive voice of the character. He had a warm heart and delighted fans around the world with his performances.
Raise a glass to the Batman that will live forever in our hearts.
The only thing I can think to say is : "good night, bat." He will be greatly missed.
What the fuck. Rip the legend.

![gif](giphy|oMLJaPmbUnoC4)
My heart is broken.

Batman: TAS meant so much to me and so many other kids growing up. Conroy was iconic, he respected the character, breathed life into the character, in a way that can never be matched.

RIP to the GOAT.
This is the hardest part of life. Your idols and heros, die. Just like the rest of us. They seem so immortal and god-like. 

Thank you Kevin Conroy, for giving us your gift and bringing to life such an iconic character, and for molding my childhood indirectly.
My week is even more ruined. My favorite batman voice by far.
My heart stopped when I found out about his passing. Didn't grow watching TAS but I really loved his voice in the Arkham series. He will be missed.
Dear Mr. Conroy, I
 am not from the States and thus never got anywhere near meeting you in a convention, but I would like you to know that I ALWAYS say that you're my favorite Batman. You've inspired me, showing that The Dark Knight is more than just a hero of vengeance, but a hurt boy who wanted to do right by his parents.

I was shaking and had tears in my eyes for a few solid minutes, so this new paragraph is being written now that I'm more calm.

Three sequences come to mind:

First of all, the heart-wrenching moment where Bruce is crying out to his dead parents about his need for approval to let Batman go because he "didn't count on being happy". This was in the fantastic Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm.

In addition, the beyond icionc moment in the third episode of Batman: The Animated Series, Nothing To Fear: where you read out the iconic quote of "I Am Vengeance,  I am the night. I am Batman" in a way that is enragves in my mind.

Lastly, the episode "Perchance To Dream," where Batman wakes up in a dream world where his parents are live, is one of my favorites. The final fight between Bruce and "Batman" on the tower goes miles to say what your interpretation of my favorite character represented.

I tip my hat off to you, sir, and genuinely hope you are resting in peace and that all your close ones are okay (relatively speaking).

Thank you for bringing Batman into all of our hearts ❤️
Rest In Peace to a legend
Fuck. Man, I've been seeing photos of him recently and starting to realize he was definitely looking quite a bit aged in the last couple years. But still, didn't think we were this close to losing him. 

His voice will always be my Batman and Bruce. He nailed it. RIP to a legend.
RIP to the legendary one.
I'm really shocked. My brother and I will always have fond memories of growing up with him in Batman TAS and Batman Beyond. 

He's left behind so much work. 

Did he do any work for the caped crusader show that got axed by HBO? Since he was going to voice Batman, will they hold off on making the show altogether? I'm not sure on the details on what the development was at this time.
Oh fuck this.
He died the hero. His legend will live on forever. 

"Alfred. Activate the Knightfall Protocol."
RIP to THE Batman
Correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't he played Batman more than anybody else live action or animated?  (I'm counting a series as 1 credit)
He will always be the definitive Batman/Bruce Wayne voice to me. Rest in Peace
What did he die of? He was so young at 66
Rest in peace Kevin. Your forever batman to us.
Damn. My daughter (14) and I adore this man. I grew up watching the original BtAS, introduced my kiddo to him through the Arkham games. He's the true voice of Batman to her as much as he is to me. 

We're both just gutted. 

Best wishes and condolences to his surviving family and friends, and to all of us who will always remember him as "our" Batman.
Fuck this just hit hard. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to experience him as the legendary superhero he was before he passed. RIP
The Greatest Batman. And it ain’t even close. No disrespect to all of our fan faves, but I’d bet a Shakespeare bust with a hidden switch that Adam West offers K.C. a seat when he makes it upstairs.
Omg What? Nooooooo! RIP
I am fucking heartbroken. We'll miss you Batman.
o7 RIP the goat Batman voice
Definitely THE Batman voice.  It's the voice that I hear when I read Batman comics.
THE Batman... rest in piece, Dark Knight. You will be missed.
I’m heartbroken. I had the pleasure of meeting him at a convention a couple years back and I remember him being very kind and humble. He will forever be the definitive voice of Batman.
This sucks man, I grew up watching the animated series in the 90’s then justice league in the early 2000’s. Someone post that shot of him sitting with the little girl on the swing set as he waits with her to pass away 😢
Hail the One True Bat. 😢😢😢😢
Wtf dude, I wanted to meet him so much. He was a legend
This is heartbreaking. Truly. I was mentally prepared for this moment, but then I decided to read his story in “finding Batman”and it really broke me. I hope this man found enough happiness in his life to make out for the grief he had to endure. RIP
He wasn’t my Batman, but I will always defend him as THE best Batman. Sad day
Rest in peace Bruce, Batman, Sir Kevin Conroy.
“Kevin was perfection. He was one of my favorite people on the planet, and I loved him like a brother. He truly cared for the people around him — his decency shone through everything he did. Every time I saw him or spoke with him, my spirits were elevated.” - Mark Hamill

#BeTheBatman

On a personal note, when I met Kevin with Dom I told him,”As a kid I used to watch BTAS with my father, Batman was my hero…I shook his hand, and said,” and he still is.” I took this line from my favorite episode “The Gray Ghost”. It is amazing because Conroy and Adam West worked together. He took time with everyone. 
One of my favorite memories of this day was also the day Meghan told me she was pregnant with Lucy, right before we left!
Kevin’s Batman is who I hear in my head everytime I read comics. He’s been Batman for 30 years. His voice is iconic. 
Megh got me a cameo by him and he spent six minutes. Telling me to fight when I was at my sickest. His voice is powerful.
We have a tradition of watching Christmas with the Joker every Christmas Eve, since Dom was born. Gonna be a little harder this year.
Rest in Power Kevin, your legacy will be remembered through generations.

He will always Be The Batman.
![gif](giphy|6MBNelzCrD7Ne)

The big guy upstairs shone the bat signal and like any good Batman, Conroy couldn’t ignore the call. Thus another dark knight’s crusade ends far too soon. May he rest well.
😢😭 one of my favorite memories as a kid was waiting for dad to get home so we could watch Batman The Animated Series. Then having him in the Arkham games as well, he will always be the voice of Batman to me! RIP
Brought so much life to a character who wasn’t often written to have much and was truly passionate about all things Batman. Conroy was one in a million and will be sorely missed.
GOAT Batman. RIP Kevin
Man this is the first celebrity death as an adult that’s hit me god damn. His voice is so iconic to me. The animated series I watched as a kid on cable TV. The show was never in order and as a kid I never knew when it was on. As a kid we were too poor to buy video tapes, but once I got older and started earning money from a government grant through college instead of buying a bus pass. I bought the dvd box set of the animated series. And re lived my child hood 

He made me fall in love with the character Batman. I followed that to my adult life, playing the games, buying the comics and the whole time I’m reading, or even thinking it’s his voice in my head.
But. But. He's Batman. He was my Batman. He can't die. This is a sad sad day.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
Fuck no... shit. RIP Batman.
RIP Kevin, you were the definitive Bruce/Batman. It’s your voice I hear in my head when I read the comics and by which I measure every other performance.
Thank you for everything.
Batman has always been a crucial part of my life, his 30th anniversary issue cover was my first poster I had ever hung up on my wall, Arkham Asylum was the first game I had ever platinumed, Under the Red Hood is one of my favorite films of all time and overall Batman has been a big part of my life.

I’ve never been hurt and defeated by the death of a public figure since Stephen Hillenburg.

Rest In Peace to Kevin Conroy.
This is the day we lost the batman, rest in peace our dark knight. Watch over the great city in the sky.
Easily one of the best voice actors on the planet and by all accounts, a great human being too. We lost a phenomenal human being today. The onpy consolation we have is that he left behind an insurmountable legacy that will live on. He left a mark on generations of fans, young and old alike. 

He is Batman.
As long as Batman exist Kevin will live on
I was just gutted to hear it this morning. We will endlessly debate over who is the best live-action Batman, but Kevin Conroy is the ***reason*** that we always have to add the caveat "live-action" to that discussion.
I never really get upset at celebs dying, but I cried today at this news. I met Kevin Conroy at a convention here in Ireland, I have an entire tattoo sleeve of Batman comics, I love the character and it's because of him. 


Conroy was an inspiration to myself and so many others because he was just a guy who really loved playing the character. He will **ALWAYS** be the true Batman to me.
I had no idea he was battling cancer.. and i didn't realize how much he meant to me until the tears starting rolling. You'll forever be in my heart, and a staple of my childhood.
I normally don't get worked up over the passing of a celebrity, but this one has absolutely crushed me.  I grew up with his Batman ever since I was a child.  RIP
This man was my hero as a child. Someone who motivated me to do better against all odds. He will forever be missed. Always Batman in my eyes. Thank you Kevin.
Not just the voice, but the acting. He put just the right amount of charm and elegance to Bruce Wayne, and just the right amount of dark, brooding, fortitude into Batman. There was no man more perfect for the role. This is a sad day. May he rest in peace. Thank you for everything Batman.
I would always come home from school and watch Batman. This voice is what manhood should sound like.
Noooooooo!
He will always be my Batman. I cried a little, you guys. That never happened to me before, you know? Crying over a famous person’s death.

Fuck cancer.

![gif](giphy|4eGUxJc4lplh6)
This is the batman I grew up with. My first batman thing that I owned was Mask of the Phantasm, which btw is a phenomenal animated batman movie, if you are a fan of the character, WATCH MASK OF THE PHANTASM TODAY!

I am so sad to hear we will get no more of Conroy's epic voice in any future Arkham games. Maybe there shouldn't be any more for a good long while. Let the character rest and don't just stick the voice actor from bioshock infinite in place of Kevin. Studios can be so indelicate with these matters. 

RIP Batman, Bruce, Kevin... you're going to that great batcave in the sky.
May Conroy's legacy continue to inspire all of you Crusader's out there. Please shine a light in the sky for this legend today 🦇🦇🦇
30 years ago…that is when he began the journey as Batman. I was only 2 years old; 32 now.

Kevin Conroy is a icon to me. There have been numerous actors who have portrayed Batman. Whether it were live action…or voice performance. But  in my opinion - he is the essential Batman!

The animated series, the movies, the Arkham video games….he leaves a ever lasting legacy

Mr. Conroy? You will be missed.

You are, and were, the vengeance.

You are, and were, the night!

You are, and forever, will be…BATMAN!
What a staple of so many childhoods, Adam West’s passing made me sad but this is ruining me.
He evened the odds. He can rest now.
Kind of sad to think that the two definitive TV Batman’s passed away in the last five years. 

No one will ever replace Conroy and West.
He made justice league and batman beyond what it is today.

![gif](giphy|gcxGeT2BGk6Dm)
At first I thought this was one of those stupid scam things but when I looked it up I was shocked 
He'll always be the heart and soul of Bruce Wayne/Batman
Rip
Batman: TAS is one of the greatest shows of my youth, and Kevin Conroy was a huge part of it.  Really shocking to hear today.
Legends never die.
I like to think on the other side conroy batman is getting introduced to Adam west Bruce Wayne for the greatest team up
The legend, the best. The true batman. 
Will miss you. RIP
Sad news. In my opinion the definitive Batman. The best to ever play the role across all mediums!
![gif](giphy|ObXgWWGHzMlVe)
Without Batman, crime has no punchline.
I’ve never had a celebrity death cause me to burst into tears before yesterday. I had a terrible childhood, and Conroy and Dini’s work together were a beacon of light for me in the hardest times of my life. I hope he is at peace, he can rest easy now.  It’s the end of an era, but we will always have the memory of his splendid work. I’m getting ready to binge the Arkham games as we speak.
I was bawling my eyes out all day when I saw the news. It was just unbelievable… I think a lot of us agree that another chunk of our has childhood died with Kevin Conroy’s passing. 

I had a steady diet of Batman as a kid and I distinctly remember watching Batman: The Animated Series at 5 years old (in ‘93) thinking “I want to be Batman.” A lot of that had to do with Kevin’s portrayal, his voice - he legit gave Batman a soul, and out of all the actors who have come before and after him….no one has really nailed the essence of Batman/Bruce Wayne, the caped crusader, the dark knight, the ninja, the tactician, the conflicted *man* just trying to do good in a world of evil…. the HERO. Fuck, man, I’m on the verge of tears writing this…

I can’t speak for everyone, but what I can say is that Kevin Conroy will always be legendary, and he had such a profound impact on why I became the Batman fan I am today. He’s going to be deeply missed… 
💔🦇
I really hope dc do a cracking tribute to him via a dcau/btas inspired comic. Deserving of something like that.
He was the perfect Batman great as both Bruce Wayne and as Batman .
There will be others who will take up the mantle but none will be as good as him
GOAT Batman. Easily. His voice and the visual of Batman go so well together. So glad he had a chance to play a live-action version, as well, before he passed. RIP.
In honor of Conroy I'm playing though the Arkham trilogy again. He is not only the most iconic version of The Dark Knight but is also the only person that could make a believable transition between Wayne and Batman. In my head there will never be another Batman.
West, Keaton, Bale?! Hell no; Conroy!!!
I was 21 when Batman The Animated Series premiered and was hooked from the beginning. Video games, movies, Justice League, and on. I was fortunate to hear him speak in a panel at LA Comicon, last year(?).

And met him just before the pandemic. Where he signed my BTAS action figure.
RIP to Kevin. We've known about his battle with HIV for over a decade, so the news of his passing isn't really a huge shock, but still, just awful to hear.
I was 7 years old when i first saw Batman: The Animated Series on TV. And Batman's voice was so reassuring, so passionate and so powerful all thanks to Kevin Conroy's performance. Batman: TAS is the reason i'm a Batman fan to this day. I'm 35 now and i've been absolutely heartbroken ever sinds i heard of his passing. When i think of Batman i think of Kevin. It's his voice i hear everytime. You are Batman Kevin and forever will be. May you rest in peace.
WB should rerelease Mask Of the Phantasm for the holidays.
Damn this hit me like a bullet
He’ll always be Batman.
Just heard this a couple of days ago... Rest easy Kevin!!! #thetruebatman.
This is so depressing :/ 

Dude helped make my childhood
After watching the Nolan trilogy, I'm finally watching Batman: The Animated Series for the first time. They opened the show with a few seconds of **"In memory of Kevin Conroy"** which was nice.
HOW?!  He was 66 and I didn’t hear anything about him being sick
Hmmm - just googled this and didn’t see anything and it says he’s alive and well
I hope it’s a hoax. He’s a legend. Gutted to even read the headline.
We lost THE Batman and a gay icon/elder 😭
RIP, Mr. Conroy. May your memories be eternal. Excelsior!
This doesn’t seem legit.
Bullshit, checked the news and her Twitter. Not finding any of this. This is not funny
Nothing else mentions his passing.
u/DrDabsMD you absolute buffoon
Haven't found anything to back this up, are you sure it's legit?
Any real news source reporting this?
Not funny
In an alternate universe...

Hope they're playing the Arkham Games and not Superman 64...
C'mon man, at least link the artist

 [His instagram](https://www.instagram.com/timmeroh/)

[His tumblr](http://blazersatdawn.tumblr.com)

The guy has more comics with that same tone starring Batman so check him out!



[deleted]
Anyone else think it's weird when Alfred is portrayed as calling him "Master Wayne?" It should be "Master Bruce," it's much more fatherly; especially because "master" in this case actually means "young man" so it's like Alfred is still playing that role no matter how old Bruce gets.
>yas

Pls no
Right so Step Brothers. So fresh.
/r/ComedyCemetery 
Something about this simple comic takes me right back to when I used to do this. 
Brought that feeling right back for a split second. 
Damit I'm envious of any kid in this situation right now. 
This makes my heart smile.
Thought this was /r/comedycemetery just add yaas a bunch to batman. That makes it ironic funny and relatable right guys.

Edit: to be perfectly clear this is not a criticism of the artist. I'm glad he's trying. Better to shoot and miss than never shoot. Im judging the reddit hive mind for applauding so vigorously at the comic equivalent of a rim shot.
So much room for activities!
r/comedycemetery
This is really stupid.
This is rather sombre to think about. [Bruce hasn't been a kid since he was eight years old](https://youtu.be/004v84trxws?t=44)
Yas I downvoted that. 
this sucks
In an alternate universe...

Actually, no, no alternate universe would find this shitty comic amusing in the slightest.
Did anyone else read this in Will Arnett's Lego Batman voice?
Look up JL8 webcomic
Sir, you're a grown-ass man. 
Why does this need to be an alternate universe? Can happen in any universe as long as Frank Miller ain't writing.
Please tell me there are more of these!!
I think this is more relatable to Damian and Jonathan now lol
I like this...

What software does obe use to create a comic like this?
So what was that Batman issue where he asked Aquaman to help him get his man-cave stuff from the bottom of an underground river?

Aquaman DID get his man-cave stuff, then told Bruce that he can just ASK Arthur to come over and hang out.
I read this as Andy Dwyer and the British guy 
They're playing Marvel v Capcom
Am I misunderstanding the joke?

They are so happy that Clark can stay because they were expecting that Clark Kent, right?

The Joker’s introduction in the 60s TV series and Nolan’s trilogy

[deleted]
[deleted]
Another homage to previous Batman films. 

In the '89 Batman, the scene where the joker shoots down the batwing is very similar to the "hit me!" scene in the TDK.

Edit: charged TDKR to TDK I'm an idiot haha
So this is Heath Ledger, as the Joker, wearing a mask that references a scene where Cesar Romero, as the Joker, wears a Pagliacci outfit and a Weary Willie mask.
Can someone just give Nolen a ton of money to make a good justice league 
[deleted]
If you haven't at least watched the first season, do yourself a favor and give a watch. 1966 Batman was great, campy fun. You just have to laugh at some of the "heists" the villains come up with and the overall proper/stern but fair attitude West portrays as Batman throughout the series. It really is one of the best versions of Batman portrayed.
Can you believe "the dark knight" is now 10 years old?
Everything about TDK is pure epicness.
If you look carefully you can see Romero’s moustache under the face paint because he refused to shave it off for the role.
[deleted]
2008? Jesus Christ, this movie still feels new to me
It’s also taken from Stanley Kubricks the killing. The robbery scene is almost exactly the same. 
I love the symbolism here. There is no mask. Under the makeup, it’s still the clown. Still the joker. It’s jokers all the way down. 
Romero did it better. 
Oh shit. 
/r/MovieDetails
I still think Heath Ledger should have worn a mustache and simply painted over it. Would have tied the whole insanity look together.
We live in a society 
that's cool I had no idea those masks were a call back to 66 I thought they were Nolan making a nod to the Stanley Kubrick film the killing 

[http://1125996089.rsc.cdn77.org/wp\-content/uploads/2014/10/Mask\-The\-Killing.jpg](http://1125996089.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mask-The-Killing.jpg)
Cesar Romero Joker doing Heath Ledger Joker's creepy murder stuff would be the best Joker.
I think the character in The Dark Knight is a rip off of that show Cesar Romero was in. 
The Joker has no alter ego or hidden identity. Under the mask is just another mask.
I saw The Dark Knight in theaters 4 times. That's four movie tickets worth of money, this movie was that good.
Waiting for the orange slices comments, super disappointed...
Am I the only one who thinks Cesar Romero looks like Tim Allen in that last picture? 
Cesar was the best joker, for real
If I pull that off, will you die?
*Ridiiiiiiiii Pagliacciooooo*
Wow I never knew this. Makes me love the film that much more. 
Heath Ledger's was the most-deserved Oscar win in a generation.

And I'd like to think he'd have won it had he lived, too.
/r/2healthbars
My God. So that's where the inspiration came from. Nolan is a mad lad and I love it. 
The 60s Batman also had some other great actors in the role of villains. 
JUST....PERFECTION. 
So good.  
That movie came out ten yrs ago? Jeez 
Uhuhuhuhu. Batiman
I always love that Romero gave so few fucks that he wouldn't even shave his mustache.
Didn't really need 3 of each since nothing is similar other than the mask
NOOLAAAAAAN
I love Nolan
That’s called homage. 
And to add to the homage, in an extended cut of this scene, Heath Ledger does a “Romero” in which he pulls down his pants and underwear while standing in a bucket of warm water and enjoys the sensation as young boys fling orange wedges at his naked ass.

EDIT: Ok, I’m being downvoted. Let me clarify that some say it was actually tangerine wedges that Romero had a fondness for. Jesus Christ guys, rip my inbox...
I wanna think this was intentional but I feel like Christopher Nolan is one of those people who completely dismiss 60s Batman for being “campy”
Wow never seen this
Nobody realized it was a nod until years later. I grew up on the 1966 batman and it was campy etc but had good moments 
No. Fucking. Way.
ungh, it's so easy to see shit like this and say "wow, what a nice nod to the origins of these stories!"

but he straight up stole his plots, stole lines *word for word*, and imo never gave any credit. 
The more you learn about Nolan, the more you gotta respect his genius. 
r/moviedetails
Ledger's joker was terrifying and awesome. Second only to Mark Hamill's interpretation for me. Shame we'll never see more.

Where does Superman think Batman learned it from?
I'm guessing Batman started doing this after Jason became Robin.
i think you're supposed to beat them each time you put in a quarter. that way the kid can comprehend the cumulative effects of constantly being a shithole

This is to good to be true 
[Homie don't play that!](https://youtu.be/YxYvzVxJtYM)

An early inspiration, perhaps?
Isn’t this a Vine?
Who do you think taught him this? Maybe the man who raised him since he was a boy?
The *real* reason behind Batman v. Superman. 
_And I’m telling Alfred_

Whoa! I didn’t know Superman was a bitch 
Weird
Flip a coin, if the child calls it correctly they get beaten.
This was a vine right? Old woman in a mirror if I remember correctly
Wait isnt what he said a vine?
That moment you realize that every kid Batman parented cannot be called kids in their mentality. 
Now I can enjoy my favourite vines in comic book form instead, what a world I live in.

Two-Face gun powder art (x-post from r/oddlysatisfying)

That was awesome, also loving how long it showed the finished product, I was totally prepared for a gif that cut after 0.3 seconds of showing the finished piece
/r/unexpected at the end there. That was amazing
[Here's the artist's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVFL1NCAxCo) with a bit more of the video
That was pretty sweet. Please post that in /r/batmangifs too, we'd love it
Ooooh shit that ending!
/r/comicbookart would dig this.
is it just me or are all these gunpowder drawing things not really all that interesting, at least after the first one. The reveal at the end was the only thing that made this one kinda cool to me, but up til that point, I was just "meh"
Finally one of these that's interesting to watch, most of the time its just a slightly blurry brown version of how the picture started. This one was pretty cool.
Look out Batman, it's scaryface! Oh wait Harvey's here. Harvey look out, Scaryface is next to you 
Don't these people have smoke detectors in their homes?
Now that was satisfying to watch. Thanks.

Man I can't wait to see some one become IRL Two-Face trying to make gun powder art. 
Hate to break it to you guys, [but he's called One-Face now.](https://i2.wp.com/batman-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TDK1TwoFace.jpg?quality=85&strip=info)
Why do these guys never do this in some kind of a basket. Now you have to sweep all the gunpowder up!
Congratulations, you did more with Two-Face than Nolan did. 
Is there something mixed in with that gunpowder? Because in my experience it should be burning MUCH faster. 
I mean it looks kind of cool, but I'm not really seeing the point. Is there some benefit to this method that a brush or pen cant replicate?
*Begins to draw with the gunpowder* My my my, this is turning out very nic- ACHOOOOOOOO
I don't read much Batman but I just finished "The Long Halloween" (thanks library!) and I really liked the story. Wasn't too fond of the artwork but I liked that it was kind of Batman meets The Godfather. 
Well done, just like Harvey's face.
It's lit
*Everything burns.*
By chance is the artist here? I would be very interested in buying a print of this. 
Is this going to be debunked like that glitter glue gif a few months ago?
I hope he also filmed this with something other than a potato.
wow! how much? lol
At first I thought it was a cake and someone was trying to put out the candles.

HOW THE F*CK! WOW!
Dude. U rock. I cant even make eye contact with you right now.😑

This was awesome 
Holy crap! Now do it again!...
Are you kidding me.... Thats amazing, Batastic
Wow!  Well done.
A little odd that he didn't do this... you know... outside.
Were do i buy this at 
Guys, if you are trying this, use smokeless powder. Loading black powder explodes, smokeless burns instead of exploding and is mainly used for fuses. 
WHERE IS HE-

oh...

that's pretty neat
Awesome!
That was amazing.
It combined two of my favourite things, art and fire!

Wow. 
Not sure why but would have loved this much more had the actors face not been used.
Two face is one of my favorite batman villains, he is pretty underrated. 
That's really creative! :D
Please do a Kendrick Lamar one and light the top on fire first!
remindme! 2 weeks

This is the right way to do a two face project.  Burn half of it with gunpowder!
Not going to lie. THAT IS INCREDIBLE! 

I too was a little disappointed the Batman side didn't spark, but it probably would have ruined that sweet Aaron Eckhart underneath.
Damn
Best batsman ever 

[Is it Batman?](https://youtu.be/0yMmiJHOLuI)
How do I buy this
I want this but the reveal to just be James Comey stoneface expression 
HARVEY DENT, CAN WE TRUST HIM?
i just want u to know that i was watching this thinking about how dumb it was to not draw harvey dents face and instead put this huge inarticulated batman and then FULLY GASPED at the reveal. i'm still in shock.
That was lit
Now who's gonna clean that mess 
impressive
That's the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen. 
This gimmick is getting old
I was hoping to see Gus Fring there at the end.
You know Harvey was thinking "No! Not again!"
Oh man i want this now lol
Perfect for All-Star! 
I love how ironic this is
Yo this is legit. 
You couldn't get a fucking tripod? 
Frank Miller batman and two face no less!
Watching the dark knight  
dinotomic!!! one of my favorite artists
It would be so much better if the right side was covered in batman gun powder and then lit to reveal Dent's burnt side.
Man the eye is just so well down, sometimes it even felt like it was moving. 
Okay, but why the gunpowder if the other half is not? 
I was about to be like "what is all this hype about setting fire to his artwork" and then I saw the end and was like "oh ok no that's amazing."
can somebody please give this man some gold?!
the internet has made me lazy.. I wanted that gif to be 5 seconds at most.

:/


Wow, that is incredible. Great job! I imagine that’s got to be a bit nerve-wracking to watch it burn and hope it does so correctly.
I find this to be incredibly ironic
Dopeness
Fourteen years ago today this man changed the face of comic book villains forever. Has anyone eclipsed him since?

[deleted]
Before I checked the subreddit, I thought this was Val Kilmer from Heat
Give a little credit to Nolan as well. Heath gave an amazing performance, but Nolan wrote the lines/story.

Regardless, a timeless performance
Aaron Eckhart was amazing as well
Homelander is a tremendous villain, although with a very different tone.
Still my most favorite movie by far.
I dunno man...Danny DeVito as The Penguin was pretty awesome.
The only one at that level I would say is Antony Starr’s Homelander.
David Tennant absolutely fucking killed it as Killgrave in Jessica Jones. His performance was legit terrifying.
Honestly I would say that Willem Dafoe's second go-'round as Green Goblin was amazing.
Homelander is my favorite villain since this
[deleted]
I’d say Anthony Starr’s Homelander. Two completely different performances but they’re equally engaging psychopaths.
Don’t know if “eclipsed” but Antony Starr’s performance as Homelander is pretty goddamn close, if not equal
I wrote a long spiel arguing no, and then remembered Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin from Daredevil. He’s at least on the same level with a much lesser known villain. 

Shout out to Loki for being in the conversation too and Thanos being worth the buildup. 

Scarlet Witch was let down by poor writing. The Riddler wasn’t as magnetic. Bane had to follow Ledger and suffered from weaker writing. Kilmonger and Zod were great, but not lasting. Goblin and Doc Ock are great, but don’t eclipse Spider-Man in their movies.
Not sure we will ever have a better Batman Villain portrayal. I have Heaths Joker tattooed on me, he was brilliant
Changed the face of villians in general. Everyone was doing they version of the weird voice for like 8 years after. Look at Michael Pitt in Hannibal
Dafoe should be mentioned
Anthony Stars Homelander
For a second i thought this was a picture from payday lol
yeah Jared Leto as Morbius
.... that was 14 years ago? Couldn't have been..... it was like 5 years tops... right?
Eclipsed no, but I'm gonna put Joaquin Phoenix right up there with him.
I mean, have you guys even seen Morbius?
Why am I barely seeing wilson fisk in here? He was a fantastic villain.
Homelander is close
Eclipsed? They'd be lucky to be mentioned in the same sentence as this legend
David Tenant as Purple Man Killgrave in Jessica Jones. 

Andrew Scott as John Moriarty in Sherlock tv show (don’t think that counts??)
I think the acting is masterful and timeless but I *really* hate that this joker has been co-opted by so many weird anti-social cringe groups out there.
The only ones that come close for me are Thanos, Killgrave and Kingpin. Oh and Homelander.
I have never sen this photo before.
He’s still the king. When TDK came out, Roger Ebert said “Batman is no longer a comic book.”
Josh Brolin as Thanos in Infinity War.

Antony Starr as Homelander in The Boys.

Vincent D'Onofrio as Fisk in Daredevil.

Only ones I can think of that are actually memorable.
Imo I thought phoenixes joker came close, since he was different.  It wasn’t just a sob story for plot convenience, it was the plot.  While not nearly as close, the riddler was also cool in the Batman.  As a villain not hell bent on killing Batman, but seeing Batman as an ally.  This is kind of like joker in this movie, wanting to strike at Gotham, not Batman.
Eclipsed Him AS Joker.. No. He nailed it in ways that I didn’t know existed. But as far as great casting for a villain.. I love Margot Robbie as Harley and Kaley Cuoco in the animated series. Though I don’t think I’d say they “eclipse” him. So I’ll say the controversial thing that we’re all thinking but won’t admit. Sean Gunn as Weasel was perfect. He nailed every bit of it and is the greatest Character/Actor Casted that ever did grace DC.

I can't not see the spider-man 3 poster.
I always thought that Jack Nicholson should have accepted his posthumous Oscar for him and walked up to the podium and said “I thought I played the Joker. I was wrong” and then walk off!
Josh Brolin as Thanos. The first “big” galactic threat In superhero movies and it was done completely right. The way the MCU is going right now I’m horrified that Marvel is going to try to bring him and Robert Downey Jr back once time passes and people can feel actual nostalgia for those movies.
Killgrave, Homelander, and Thanos. I've never felt legit anxiety for the protagonists like I do when one of them enters the scene. It's an asshole puckering "Oh no." 

Brolin was so good at actually _believing_ he was the good guy. It was terrifying to be the ones facing what typically antagonists face, the kind of terrifying willpower only available when you _feel_ that you are facing evil. Obviously we knew he was wrong rationally, but the way Brolin breathed life into IW-Thanos was terrifying in an existential way.

Homelander is scary for the exact opposite reason. He's unhinged violence, madness, and rage given god-like power. He's the visceral, violent, bloody predator that scares you in the most primal way possible. An unbeatable threat that wants you to die. Him coming on screen reminds me vaguely of that cold-stomachy dread I felt as a kid when I was afraid of dogs and saw one. 

Killgrave is menace and manipulation given form. Every terrifying fear that makes dementia, Alzheimer's, or amnesia such horrifying concepts to us. That deep seated fear of losing free will. Doesn't hurt that Tenant's acting is arguably some of the best I've _ever_ seen either.
Possibly Josh Brolin’s Thanos.
Nope. He’s the best.
He was good for sure. I don't know why people hype it this much, though.
This scene is one of my favorite movie scenes. The whole bank job is so good
This man has a name = Heath Ledger!
Thanos was pretty dope, but Heath is in a league of his own.
No. Hands down the best villain ever in a comic book movie.
2% fairlife milk is god tier. That shit is a literal protein shake with the reduction in sugars. It’s my nightly dessert. Also if you have an espresso machine with a milk frother you get the most frothy milk using fairlife vs standard 1%, 2%, almond, or coconut milk.
As the Joker? No.

Other villains? Yes.  Thanos (especially to Nebula and how he was introduced to Gamora), Gazelle from Kingsman,  Amber Heard, etc.
Joffrey.  God I loved that little POS
I believe Paul Dano's Riddler in The Batman is actually better.
I personally feel Nicholson was a better joker before him and Monaghan was a better joker after
It's hard to beat for sure.  I'd say Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin in Daredevil was amazing as well.
He did a really good acting job, but what did he change exactly?  
Are we comparing him to other people who played joker after him, other villains, or other actors in general? 
Are we trying to argue that was the best acting ever done, because I'm pretty sure that is not the case.
Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger is probably the second best
I thought that Bain didn’t get enough credit in the next movie
Just noticed something very odd about that photo. The joker doesn’t have the scars along his mouth.
I don’t think it’s possible to
I feel old now. I mean we've come pretty damn closing to at least matching heath's portrayal, but it will never be eclipsed...never!
Josh Brolan did great as Thanos.
Thanos is a close 2nd but not yet.
No
Damn it’s been 14 years already
The way Ledger so thoroughly disappeared into the role is truly unparalleled. I remember watching the scene halfway through the film, where Joker is seen in disguise as a guard without his makeup on, and my initial thought being, “wait- isn’t that Heath Ledger? What’s he doing here?” The character of the Joker is so totally immersive that I had completely forgotten it was even him.
Yeah Cameron mohagnan
I think David Tennant as The Purple Man was great.
Mark hamill. He perfected a version of the joker that works flawlessly for an animated format. Heath ledgers body movement and facial expressions also convey the unpredictable chaos that the joker should be. They are both great for the format there applied two and they are both the two best jokers of all time.
He is a pure example of Method Acting as he is truly the best at it 🙌
He wrote the blueprint. Marvel nor DC has come even close to doing what TDK or Ledger did. A legendary movie and an even more legendary performance. Neither of which is repeatable.
Man I cant believe it came out 14 years ago. TAKE ME BACK
In terms of pop culture impact, I think we can agree Thanos reached that top tier of villains. Loki too but more of an antihero than villain.
Hiddleston has made Loki an international star and beloved character. Go to one comic con and there’s like 50 fifty Loki’s walking around. He is supposed to be a villian but yet people love him to fucking death. I’d throw his name in the ring.
There's an argument.

![gif](giphy|Mn3Ln0vTxZ4lEIObrz)
![gif](giphy|7wk6RQYXDDytXalsL4)
Yes, Mark Hamill
Eclipsed? Maybe not, but Cameron Monaghan has done two (sort of 3, but I don't count that last episode as happening) distinct takes on the Joker in Gotham that both hit the mark *very* well for different reasons.
Heath's Joker was by far the most interesting and realistic villain, as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy was a more relatable to real life scenario compared to other more comical hero movies. But I can say the Riddler in The Batman (2022) was really good imo.
Joaquin Phoenix came very close.
At what point during the opening scene does he put his makeup on?
[deleted]
Bale Gor
Homelander
Vincent kingpin
Tenant kilgrave

Are all contenders
Joaquin Phoenix did a helluva job with Joker, probably with inspiration taken from Heath Ledger's version.
I don’t think anyone can Eclipse his Joker, no greater height to reach. Someone eventually can be as good as he was.
Thanos and Killmonger are the best MCU villains imo and Hardy’s Bane was really great (til they chopped his balls off with the twist) but Ledger’s Joker still the greatest
Imo no one has come close to matching Ledger’s TDK performance as Joker. Not even close. He, the Nolan’s, and Goyer created something special with Joker
I don't know about eclipsed... but Michael Shannon's performance as Zod is definitely up there with Heath's Joker.
Thanos comes close
I wouldn't say eclipsed, but I would say that Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger forged a new path that could stand at an equal level with Heath Ledger's Joker.
Though it seems to get a lot of hate, Jared Leto's Morbius is pretty descent...way better than Jared's joker. Thanos is really good too. That said, RIP Heath
No One Will Ever
I just noticed that there's a Spiderman 3 poster in the background

Edit: Did I do something wrong?

Edit again: NVM, I was getting a lot of downvotes when I first edited it and was wondering what I did to cause the downvotes
Heath defined the modern day villain in cinema. I doubt someone will ever top him.
Changed the face of comic book villains? How so? By adapting one so poorly it bears no resemblance to the source material?
[removed]
Josh Brolin
Comic book *movie* villains
No one has eclipsed him and probably never could, but i think the most recent interpretation might be able to get close to his level
Just like all batmans aren't created equal, neither are the jokers. Joaquin was great in his stand-alone film. Leto was pure trash. Mark Hamill is still solidified in batman history/lore. Heath Ledger was a beautiful soul taken too soon. He took his role so seriously that it messed with his already declining mental health. He will always be my Joker. If only they'd let Cameron Monaghan step in as the Joker for The Batman 2. I feel he'd be much better than the stand-in they used for their deleted scene/ending.
Its not possible to surpass him. Not because he acted better then anyone ever could but because of the timing this came out. This was the first superhero movie to be taken seriously. Sure the spiderman movies were popular before this but this was the first superhero movie to really make it and be praised by fans and critics and become mainstream. The movie industry is so oversaturated with comic book movies now that it's just not possible for anything else to stand out like this one did.
thanos maybe
I prefered phoenix's joker.

I think ledger's joker was great but it's a tad overrated because he died. No one would make a post like this if he was still alive for example.
Danny DeVito's Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Anthony Starr's Homelander, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Paul Dano's Riddler. They all are just as good.
Don’t think it would be hyped as much if he didn’t pass tbh
Tom Hardy as Bane did I think.
No, he is still the G.O.A.T
Thanos has
Phoenix was literally a better Joker.
The performance is hugely over rated.  Definitely influenced by his death.  That said. It was a good performance and an even better movie.
I think Thanos comes close. Heath and Brolin give fantastic performances. Both are memorable. Both are constantly quoted.
Im still not a fan
Josh Brolin as Thanos?
Dafoe as Goblin in NWH

Thanos in both avengers

Killgrave

Kingpin

Olsen as Wanda in both Wandavision and Dr strange 

This for me are more less in the same tier as the joker in tdk

As amazing heath, joker TDK is only my second favorite joker

For me the best one is Arkham Joker
Josh Brolin as Thanos. Both very different characters, both acted their characters extremely well and have unforgettable quotes.
He was good but he was no Brolin/Thanos.

All Ledger did was play a very well written character well.
Thanos
i personally don’t think anyone ever will. he perfected the mold then destroyed it
Overrated as hell.
Unpopular opinion here but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was a better Joker.

Probably another unpopular opinion but Ledger's best movie was A Knight's Tale. (Paul Bettany was amazing too).
Why does killing himself self make everyone think he did such a great job?  I'm actually asking because I never really understood, extreme characters are much easier to act than subtle characters and I don't feel like he really did that much, it was a comic book character.   Why does giving up and killing yourself suddenly make people think you can act well?
Heath's Joker is good, but not "revolutionary".

There's been good, great, better before and after.

It serves the story/setting of the Dark Knight trilogy.
Nope, and no one will ever get close
Paul Dano’s Riddler is a weird incel ape on Ledger’s Joker, but the one villain that sticks with me the same way is Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger.
So overrated
No
Is that frame from the movie?
Bonus points for the Spider-Man 3 poster.
We’ll exclude Thanos to play fair. Michael B Jordan came closest with Killmonger.
Phoenix.
Leto is my least fav with ledger right behind
yes? obviously? in the very same role?
There are a few villains who I prefer to his joker. I personally believe that jack Nicholson was a better joker and the villains in the Spider-Man raimi trilogy are unforgettable
No.
No
They should get him back. He was a great joker.
Nope, Heath will own joker forever until this the next generation comes along and doesn't even bother to watch the Nolan trilogy. Phoenix's portrayal is great, but do you really feel like you're watching a batman movie.
Jared Leto... duh!
Certainly villains have matched his quality but after a certain level "eclipsing" is just preference. 

I certainly thought Dano's Riddler was incredible. 

The fact Brolin could make a purple dude interesting in Thanos was a feat. 

Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is amazing. 

Phoenix's Joker was deeply human. 

But it's just preference on what you value
