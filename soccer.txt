Leicester City Are Premier League Champions

FUCK YES 2 YEARS AGO I WAS CELEBRATING PROMOTION. 1 YEAR AGO I WAS CELEBRATING SURVIVAL. TODAY I AM CELEBRATING THE LEAGUE
We did it, we won the Premier League.

We are staying up, we are staying up!
All memes aside, this is a historical moment.

Things currently more likely in the bookies than Leicester's odds at the start of the season 


Jeremy clarkson next arsenal boss 400/1


Alien contact next year 25/1 


San Marino win Eurovision 500/1


Nigel farage next pm 100/1


Northern Ireland win Euro 2016 500/1


"Dad I can't sleep, can you tell me a bedtime story?"

"Sure buddy, 'twas a warm summers day when Leicester appointed Claudio Ranier.."

"Oh piss off! You've already told that four times this week!"
Always rated them
Where were you when Leicester won the league?

I was at work, in a meeting, when my coworker say

Leicester is champion.

Yes
As a die hard Leicester fan since December of 2015 I cannot tell you all how much this means to me. 
To think it all began with a racist orgy in Thailand...
[Vardy banter with Kane on twitter.](http://i.imgur.com/DVF8l7j.jpg)
I don't even have the words. I'm so proud of my team and my city. This is a moment I'm going to remember for the rest of my life! 
You know what lads? I reckon Leicester might just win the title. 
Just found out I'm gonna be a dad a few hours ago and now this. Day of miracles.

Eden Hazard: Winning teams the league 2014-2016

Redditors in decades to come will be looking for this historic thread to see what it was like on here when Leicester won the fucking league. Hello humans of the future. It was an incredible journey to follow. 
Death, taxes, and Chelsea fucking over Tottenham
Absolutely fucking incredible
JAMIE VARDYS 'AVIN A PREMIER LEAGUE WINNING PIZZA PARTY
**Leicester City**, **Leicester** *fucking* **City** are the 2015/16 Premier League Champions! That is not going to sink in for a long time. Huge congratulations to everyone at Leicester, I am so happy for Ranieri. They'll be talking about this one for a long, long time.

I don't care who you are or who you support. You have to respect Leicester City as a football club. I'm super happy for them and as a Chelsea fan, it will help me to know that we did at least one good thing this season.
The fairy tale has actually happened.

Congrats to Leicester. Don’t think we will ever see anything like this again for some time in the premiership.

CLAUDIO RANIERI JUST WON THE PREMIER LEAGUE WITH LEICESTER CITY, PLAYING COHESIVE TEAM FOOTBALL LED BY ENGLISH HERO JAMIE VARDY. 10TH PLACE CHELSEA PLAYED SPOILERS AGAINST SPURS.  

...What the fuck, it's like everything I've ever known about football has been shattered. Insane season

Edit:  more direct and cohesive than 'attacking', which still amazes me for this side. They had the 3rd highest goal tally (albeit in a low scoring season) in the league
I've never cried so much with my Dad before but this is just too special. We've been balling our eyes out and I don't give a shit. I've just calmed down enough to share how I feel with you all.

He took me down to filbert street as soon as I was old enough in his pick up, wedged in between him and my uncle with my legs either side of the gear stick and incarcerated me as a Leicester fan. I've been going with him since then and he always used to tell me after another season of abject shite that it could be worse.

I've never felt so much unrivalled joy as I'm feeling at this moment. I won't sleep tonight and I have no idea how I'm going to work all week in the lead up to seeing big Wes lift that shiny silverware. And Kasabian at the end of the month is going to be unreal!!!!!

Thank you all for wishing my city and club this amazing piece of history. Love you all. 😭😭😭😭😭
- Chat shit get banged

- Dilly ding dilly dong

- Jamie Vardy's having a party

Karma achieved
Greatest achievement in premier league history? You must be joking! Did you not see Aston villa win that corner at the weekend?
For those from /r/all, 

This is the football equivalent of Aliens landing on the White house lawn.

EDIT, PS, Dreddit is recruiting!
I think at this stage we might have to admit Leicester are just about favourites to win the league
So happy for Ranieri. 

Absolutely deserved
Un-fucking-believable. 
Ranieri is too old to change mentality and at 60 years old he only won a bunch of small trophies.


I never said that I am amazing, but I know that it is not my fault that in 2004, when I replaced Ranieri at Chelsea and I asked why they replaced Ranieri they told me that they wanted to win, and with him that would have never happened.

Every sin in Chelsea's history is forgiven
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the best story in sports history has been made today
I grew up in Rugby, just 20 miles from Leicester by LNER train. In my early youth (~60 years ago) on a Saturday, my mum & I would take the train to Leicester - she would go shopping and I would go to watch the foxes at Filbert St. The train ride would cost 2/6 (two and six) return - 2 shillings and sixpence. The train line no longer exists, but the foxes winning the Premier League today brought back lots of old Saturday memories.
Funny to see that now Chelsea finally giving their all for Ranieri. Twelve years after he leaves they win him the title...

congragations lester
Damn I can comment on this.
.....i still dont think they can possibly win it.
This went from 23k up votes to 10k. Wtf, Reddit. 
Oh fuck off, this post deserved the 22k votes it had. Fucking admins 
The greatest underdog story ever. In the entirety of sports history. 
This was at 20,000 upvotes a couple hours ago, now it's at 9,000. 

Has reddit really downvoted this that much? I guess I can see it as reddit isn't really into sports let alone soccer.

It's sad because I feel like this really did deserve the 20k upvotes as it is really *that* big of a deal...
May as well get in before this is archived

This post was at 20,000 up votes a few hours ago, now it is down at 7700, what's up with that?
good thread to change flair
99% upvoted to 91%, 22k upvotes to 20k... thanks /r/all
Which one do I upvote?!?! 
R/SOCCER IS HAVING A PARTY!!!!! 
I have to say, for many years I've been somewhat disillusioned from football, and had long lost my passion for it after Leeds went down for the first time and my dad (who supported leeds, and I followed by default) went mental to the point of putting me off.

But my god, has this been one hell of a spectacle to watch as an outsider. No matter who you are, you can watch what has happened this year and appreciate what an absurd occurrence it is. Leicester City winning the league isn't something that I ever thought would happen and even though I don't support any of the related teams, I couldn't help but be invested in this journey. 

Feeling the tension of the title race, laughing at all the memes and banter, and re-learning about the football landscape has been truly wonderful. It's made me remember all the good times, like playing shirts vs. skins in the park, or going around to my rich uncles house to watch Leeds choke in the Champions League (because back then us working class didn't have good TV), and any number of other things.

 And this has honestly made me a fan of football again, something I never thought I'd say any time soon. Obviously there's the jokes about plastic fans, but I feel this season has truly made a ton more fans for football.

It's been a great journey lads. I'll see you all again next year.
**TOO ALL THOSE WHO THINK SPURS FANS OR PEOPLE FROM /R/ALL HAVE BEEN DOWNVOTING THIS THREAD**


Reddit has a system that downvotes the hot thread after a while so that new hot threads can make it to the top, this thread has 30k+ upvotes but the system has downvoted this so that new upcoming hot threads can make the front page as well.
[deleted]
I was here when this happened
Let the meme-fest begin!
Sly mother fucking Foxes
going to be a lot of premier league clubs going with the "racist orgy" strategy this summer
I live in Leicester who wants my autograph
Wait wtf happened to all the upvardys, this post was above 10,000 earlier, now its at 9,000 and its 86% upvardyed
Idk what's crazier - Leicester winning the league or the fact that this post has fell from 18k up votes down to 6k.
>5,976 points (85% upvoted)

>8,538 votes

So does reddit just mass delete votes for popular submissions or something? This was at 16,000 points at one point, so obviously more that 8,538 people voted on it.
For those coming back to this thread in the future: this post had 22k points at one point.

EDIT DEC 26 2016

Yay they fixed it (see above comment)
I wish Leicester would have won the league while they were on the pitch. Feels a little anti-climatic with them winning during a game they weren't playing in. Still awesome!
Was going to commit suicide tonight, but Tottenham did it for me!
Haven't seen a spurs flair in here yet, so I guess i'll just say congratulations to Leicester. Well deserved title and a hell of a season for both of us. the words of Bill Nicholson are giving me strength right now.

"It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory."
To everyone wondering why this post is rapidly decreasing in upvotes, reddit has an algorithm where it automatically lowers upvote totals when they get too high to prevent vote inflation. The vast majority of these downvotes aren't real downvotes.
What's up with the downvotes making it go from 20k to 5k in a day?
how the fuck did this go from 20 something thousand upvotes to 5?
This post should by far be the top post in /r/soccer . It had 22k upvotes in about 3-4 hours and Reddit's algorithms have sunk it to about 6k. Realistically this post probably had 30k upvotes. So dissapointing...

---------------------

**EDIT DECEMBER 6, 2016**

Reddit changed their algorithms to show true number of upvotes, now this has over 70k. Much better

[Leicester City F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.) just pulled off the single most improbable rise to the top of Premier League Football/Soccer, which is the major league in England. With [Chelsea F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) tying [Tottenham Hotspur F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.) in their match today, it is [mathematically impossible for the 2nd place Hotspurs to tie or surpass Leicester City](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html), giving them their first ever [Premier League Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions) in their 132 year history. For all intents and purposes, it is one of the greatest stories in the history of the sport. Probable THE greatest.

Who gave Aguero a drum lmao
Lmao Aguero
Imagine she got tackled by security
Aguero with the drum there hahahah
I've never seen a greater joy on his face.
Lmao, that's not his mom, his mom looks exactly like him

That must be another player's mom, I think Di Maria's
Nothing beats seeing a mother proud of her child's success 🥺
Never cried harder this year until now. Just pure joy and gratefulness

Also, Aguero lmao
This is so heartwarming and wholesome
Aguero giving John Terry vibes
Aguero lmao
That's sweet.
All the mums this tournament has been a highlight, really humanises players. Made the Morocco journey so easy to invest in
Imagine your kid being Messi lol
FUCKING HELL WHERE'S DE PAUL WHEN YOU NEED HIM! /s
A World Cup for mothers. Very endearing
For years it seemed like it wasn't meant to be, but last few years he's added 2 international trophies to his vast collection.
I fucking adore the Messi family
Does anyone have a clip of them lifting the trophy? My broadcast ended too quickly
Ronaldo’s mom punching air rn
The fact that I didn’t knew who his mother was after all these years 😱
my god, the way he hugged her. i'm fucking crying.....
She got an opportunity to stand up on the podium as well when they took the team picture with the cup
 What a moment
What a productive 9 months bringing this boy into the world. Thank you Mama Messi!
That's Agüero's mom actually, every media is saying is Messi's mom even in Argentina, but she's Kun's mother.
Beautiful, a reminder that we are all human.
Props to Mama Messi ! she gave birth to the GOAT!
I love Kun Aguero. He his in a different paradise
Love how theres been so many wholesome moments with mothers in this WC
This is why even neurtals love Messi. 

The dude is humble.
Lmao Agueroooooooooo
Damn ninjas cutting onions 🥲
That's it really. Winning the World Cup and having your mom throw herself into your embrace is peak human experience.  I hope he enjoys the celebration back in Argentina, takes a long holiday, and retires from international football.  Go to Inter Miami in the US asap and enjoy life and his wealth. Such a great sportsman and what an end to his career.
that’s because it isn’t his mom……
I want a hug from Messi's mom :(
That’s not his mother. Is the head of the cooking staff of the Argentinian Training Campus. Which make this even more wholesome.
Such a heart warming moment! And Aguero in the background lol
Lmaoo Aguero with the drum
She's not his mother...She is the main cook of the Argentine national team.
Guys, that's not his mum. It's the kitchen cook of the team. It's even better because it shows how humble this man is.
That’s not his mom lol
She is the delegation cook, not the mother.
It's a very heartwarming moment but that's not his mother.

Argentine newspapers did an article about this moment and the woman, her name is Antonia Farias. The team's cook for over a decade.

Messi's mom Celia doesn't has a tattoo on her arm, she's thinner and was wearing Argentine secondary t-shirt that night.
Is not his mother. Its the team’s chef
LOL, it is not his mother!
Was  the cook , not his Mother.
Waiting for Danish news to represent Messi as a monkey because only monkeys hugs their mothers

https://mobile.twitter.com/NimaTavRood/status/1603900017600782337
That's not his mum

1. She was wearing a different set of clothes during the game

2. No tattoo on her left arm
Not his mom.

She's a lot leaner.
That’s not his mom btw
Apparently that's not his mom?
That is not his mother
Who’s cutting onions
WHOLESOME AF <3
Is that, is that Kun with the drums?? Haha
Mother to the Greatest Footballer.
I think it is cleared that she is not her mom. The woman is reportedly the cook for the national team.
She is not his mother, but the cook for their team - https://www.clarin.com/deportes/antonia-farias-mujer-abrazo-lionel-messi-protagonizo-momentos-emotivos-mundial-qatar-2022_0_qXDmF1xPua.html
It’s not his mum but a teammates mother
Is the Cook of the team. Not his mother
r/mademesmile
Always nice seeing these moments
Such a storybook ending!
I think that’s the first time I saw his mom
so sweet, bless her
God damn it that’s cute
u/savevideobot
Jeez. I didn't know he had mother. Maybe first time she ever showed up?
Who's cutting onions T_T
How does it feel to be the mother of the greatest footballer of all time?
Thank you for giving us this man!
We're all just kids at the end of the day 🥹
Aguero is high on emotions, lol
Mama GOAT!
Drumline Aguero is this years WC shiny trading card
This is so wholesome to see❤️❤️.
That's the physio.
Saw this on TV and genuinely felt emotion. This is so great to see.
I watched this guy debut and have an unhealthy obsession in this sport, yet somehow I have never seen his mother before

Which is odd because I can name some other players mothers and have slid into Zaniolos mothers DMs, insane
That's not his mom 🤣
Mother GOAT
I fucking love Aguero just being everywhere 😂 I’ve seen so many videos of him during the celebrations and he’s doing something different in every one.
That's not his mother tho
Thats not his mother
aguero npc lmao
I just love aguero in the background lmaoo
Wow. I just assumed Messi hatched out of a soccer ball somewhere.
Who is the guy Messi bumps into? Messi wanted the smoke
lmao aguero just banging on the drums
Aguero drumming in the background is killing me
That's not his mom, it's Aguero's
Lmao, that's the [team's cook](https://www.infobae.com/deportes/2022/12/19/quien-es-antonia-farias-la-mujer-con-la-que-messi-se-fundio-en-uno-de-los-abrazos-mas-emotivos-tras-consagrarse-campeon-del-mundo/)
Aguero is a sitcom character
Not actually Messi’s mum though it’s Aguero’s
This isn't his mother. She's part of the kitchen staff.
NOT Messi's mom. That's the team's chef. But all the boys super love her like a mom, so it's an understandable confusion.
It's not his mother. It's one of the cooks of the NT.
She's part of the kitchen staff. Not Lionel's mum
Thats not his mother. Is the team official cook
Not his mom, it was the team's cook that's been with them for like ten years.
It's not his mom. Reportedly it's Argentina's cook
Aguero is in EVERY video and image
not his mum is team cook
This is not her mother, it's a cook in the AFA
She''s not his mother. She is the team cooker.
Not her mother, shes to chef of the NT; chisen because she makes great milanesas napolitanas. A mother to them.
This is not his mother it’s the teams cook
NOPE! The lady in the video is actually the head cook of the Argentina national team, Antonia Farías
Someone clarified she is not the mom but the chef of the team?
It makes it all the more adorable that it's the cook for the Argentina Team, Antonia Farias.
Not his mum. The team chef. Mum has similar hair but a wider nose.
Ain’t that the team cook? Lol
That's his chef lmao.. or am I being whooshed?
aguero on the drums in the background lmao
Is not his mother. Its the chef from LA SELECCIÓN ARGENTINA DE FUTBOL
Isnt that the cook of the team
Not his mom. Argentina team cook
She's the cooker of the team *
That's not his mom lmao
That's so wholesome
Ultimate soccer mom
That’s not his mom, that’s the team chef.
Wasn't his mother, she's his chef
She isn't his mother
Not his mom
Wonder what the Danish TV will say about this?
Messi is so wholesome, I'm super happy for him!
Imagine your son is Messi.
That's not his mom lol
35 yrs ago, she wouldn’t have thought that she gave birth to the greatest player on the planet.
That is not Messi’s mother! It is Kun Aguero mother

Edit: she’s the team’s cook
Just imagine: everything they went through during his early childhood, to becoming one of the greatest players of all time against all the odds, to winning this World Cup for his country. Amazing.
I never cry. But this made me cry. But at least I cried like a man
He’s just missing that MLS cup with Miami. Don’t think his career will matter much if he can’t get that illusive piece of silverware. (Please Messi come to the MLS…..)
Thank goodness security didn't tackle her to the ground.
Mama messi looking kinda thicc though ngl
Any danish is going to call them monkeys or that is saved for the Arabs only?
Lmao Agüero.

Messi’s entire reaction in the vid was basically like this:

Hehe.

Omg who is touching me? 

Idk, better try to run.

Oh the person is pulling kinda hard. 

\* leans the other way \*

Eh, can’t run now, who is this person?

OH HEY MUM!!!!!! 

I’M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!!!
Damn this is wholesome. 💙
Is not Messi mother, is Agüero mom (Agüero is the best friend of Messi)

I will abide by the results of this poll

Combine the two. r/ballsoc.

There’s already a r/football that is about non-American football
r/calcio
r/fútbol
Did you just see that potato chip commercial?
Let’s just call it calcio and be done with it
I’d like to think the main reason Americans are hated so much in this sub is because you guys have to type in soccer every time you come here
I'm American and i often think of it as football, but in conversation, particularly during the nfl season, soccer is a useful disambiguation. I don't lose sleep over it, and when the context is changed, my language changes with it. It's not a real problem. History isn't perfect. Soccer being a nickname for football isn't perfect, but exists for a reason.
i thought this was the equivalent of footballmemes
You cant rename subreddits. Its not a feature or option.

r/football already exists though and it’s not American football being discussed
Soccer sound better
Why tf was it named soccer in the first place?
That… already exists lol
It should have always been /r/football
>he thinks petitions matter
Just so you know, the term *Soccer* comes from the British.
Should be FÚTBOL since Argentina won 😎😎
We should base it on what they call it in the country with the most aircraft carriers. All in favor?
Isn’t there already a R/football

Lol, every so often some dingus Brit teenager comes around with this.
[removed]
How about /r/associationfootball since it apples to places that call it football as well as places that call it soccer and there’s no confusion.
At least give the sub some personality and allow a wider variety of posts, make the icon and banner more interesting AT LEAST.
Then a Milion yanks would get lost in this sub thinking it's about American football. Most users are from USA anyways, so it's not a great move oh and there's already a r/football :P
Soccer, football, doesn't matter. We all love the same game
We should rename it after the correct name, association football. Actually that's a bit too long, how about an abbreviation of that. Is "soccer" OK?
That's the most pointless discussion ever. But yeah I agree.
Please don't
Go post in /r/football then lol it already exists

Soccer is American. American is unrepresented here therefore it should be football.

I’m neither from America or England. This is the least of our problems tbh. I think there’s better things to focus on than going this route again. The mods should focus on stop approving bullshit transfer rumor articles that makes no sense.
Too bad, commies 😎🇺🇸
And rename the other one Throwball
YES! 

Fuck soccer, it's FOOTBALL!
I dont mind except r/football already exists and you can rename subreddits.
[removed]
Yes please
 Assuming you already found your way here and the content stays the same does it matter?
Like others have said… There’s already a r/football. It’s not really a big fuss, it’s part of our culture though is sounds more natural to me to call it football cause of my perspective. I call it soccer a lot, I also call it football, it’s all the same at the end of the day
How come there's no option to call it Calcio?
Stfu and take my upvote
Fucking finally LETS GOO!!
Didn't the name soccer originate in the UK?
Screw the yanks
ITS. CALLED. SOCCER.
Nah it’s soccer, screw the brits.
I agree
You need to accept this place is American based I say just keep it as soccer as I’m not that fussed tbh
Imagine being so bad at the sport you invented that you’re incapable of beating your former colony for whom it is the fifth most popular sport so you throw your toys out of the crib and split hairs about a non-important dialectical deviation
Why don't we arrange a mass migration to /r/football instead
'Soccer' is the English's stupid neologism.

This place shall be r/soccer now, r/soccer forever.

Eat it with your fish and chips.
Why?
Freaking finally. It's football, Biden.
Honestly I’m English and I honestly couldn’t care less. I know what it’s for that’s the important thing. Anyone with a problem with it needs to get over themselves.

Up vote till infinite
Does anyone else think it’s cringe that people who speak American English call it football? When I watch American commentators on Fox Sports, ESPN, and other American networks it looks so forced when they call soccer football. It’s like they have to remember to call it football instead of it naturally rolling off the tongue. Unless we’re in the UK and you’re trying to assimilate or you’re British, just call it soccer. Almost every other English speaking country outside of Europe calls it soccer.
But it’s called soccer
This is the right thing
Grinds my bones to see this sub being called soccer!
I'm surprised it's not called "football," already, considering how other countries call it "football," and how "American football" actually sucks.

And rename r/football to r/handegg
No matter what day of the year it is, people crying about the name of the sub is so incredibly boring.
Fútbol?
Too early for this
What should I even say as a non-english person? Why are not having a /r/Fußball sub? 

I feel like at this point were are all cool with each other.

Yes
How about r/soccerball
Yes
Finally lads
There is already a r/football

Nah.
This is a petition I can back!
All I want for Christmas.... is thissssss
YO WTF!

I liked this idea
Soccer lovers friends, please remind me the FC in every club name stands for what ?
It's only logical.
Aight show me the poll and lemme vote, cause we MUST show that the real name is FOOTBALL

Hell yeah, finally
/Dibu
Yes 100%
Hell yeah
No.
I think it is good not to impose the disuse of the word "soccer", it is a good way to immediately detect someone who still does not know if he is hitting the ball with the left or the right
iT’s CaLlEd SoCcEr

but really who tf cares — it’s just a name for an online forum already populated by millions
But i thought we were covering soccer related stuff in here. Is everyone giving up on soccer and watching football instead now?
Soccer works fine.  It's just another name for football, not better or worse.

https://www.britannica.com/story/why-do-some-people-call-football-soccer
Association rules. Everyone has football, soccer is the derivative of association rules
beat it europeans we did better than y'all that means its called SOCCER
Yes, please
Imagine all the Americans tho. You'll need to put pictures on it so they know what it is.

Alassane Plea (Gladbach) scores a volley with his standing foot while faking a shot with his other foot

I’d probably trip and get booked for diving
I once tried this trick to pass to my teammate in the game. Don't know how I pulled it off but can vividly remember that opponents got the ball and scored on counter! No issues though, we lost 9-1.
[deleted]
Now that's impressive
Was (sadly) not even the only crazy [goal](https://streamable.com/plkix) that game.
A Gladbach post on top of r/all ? What's going on here.
To be able to get the placement on it whilst maintaing a decent facade of a right volley is immense skill. Many hours on the training ground and a lot of balls out for corners for this to come off. Fair play lad.
Let‘s pray this gave him back his confidence. Plea is such a weird player, from time to time he looks absolutely worldclass, and then he goes invisible for 6 games
Mum I feel sick, want to go home
[deleted]
Henry used to love this trick. That is harder to pull off than it looks.
Ok that's pretty neat
[deleted]
First time I saw it I thought it was accidental tbh, but that is a cheeky finish
He's not trying to fake anyone out. It's a nice instep goal where his right leg movement also happens to look like a swing at the ball.
Made in Lyon
This post is now the 3rd highest upvoted post on this sub. Not too far behind from kroos free kick at world cup lol.
This is insanely difficult i hope everyone realizes that lol
Never seen a technique like that - got some power behind it as well
"Yeah, HEH, I totally meant to do that. Sure. Didn't miss the shot at all".
It amazes me just how talented professional athletes are. I couldn't do this even if I spent everyday of my life practicing it.
Absolute madlad
One of the most impressive things I think I’ve seen on a football pitch. That’s ridiculous.
That's actually outrageous. Put a football down and run up to it and try do this. Its fucking hard.
That's not faking a shot, that's expecting the ball to come in differently but adapting. Probably more impressive tbh.
Calculated.
[deleted]
Do you think it’s 100% intentional? I want it to be so bad.
Thats some joga bonito style shot right there... amazing skill
This is the kind of trick I’d see a friend practising in a warm-up and hope they don’t intend to try it in the match.
Some puskas winning material here
That's next level
That's disgusting.
I'd like to see him try this at normal speed!
Oh that's a whole... 'nother... level

what the fuck. he actually meant that aswell which is even crazier
If you watch closely you can see the surprise on his face, right at the very end
WTF. Never seen anything like this before. To actually score doing it is pretty brilliant.
That looked unintentional to me, even he looked surprised
What the fuck
I like it
If I tried that I'd be on the sidelines with an ice pack on my nose.
That’s some next fucking level shit, I see very few players do it with passes but never a goal.
OP needs to mark this NSFW
Plea and Thuram are lethal together
Keepers face says it all really, gnarly
That’s pure fucking filth damn
what the actual fuck

something impressive! finally!
This is absolute filth
Ubelievable Tekkers
It kinda looks like he did that on purpose
Damn, that is incredible! Don't think I've seen something like this before.
Wow... One of the best goal I ever saw. Very nice!
Didn't Henry do something similar in training while playing at Arsenal?
Puskas award
u/vredditdownloader
Does anyone have the broadcast angle of this?
Looks pretty much accidental. Why would he do a fake there?
That's the most disgusting finish I've ever seen. Fucking outrageous skill.
Cagada > Talento
I doubt that was intentional
I honestly don’t know if that is technically considered a dummy or not...but damn it’s nice.
If I made contact with the ball, literally just contact, regardless of where the ball went and how stupid I’d look (that is guaranteed), I’d consider it a success.
Can anyone confirm this wasn’t just a once in a lifetime accident? Seems like something very odd to learn or practice
Mission failed successfully
I would like to say it was intentional.. to me it seems he raised his 'shooting leg' far too late. In saying that, did he raise it in that manor meaning to take the shot but it arrived early so he made do with the other leg? Hard to say. Thoughts happen thick and fast in these situations while determining the speed of the cross. I think likely a mixture of intending to shoot with that leg by reflex and timing was out so plan B kicked in. It's remarkable how capable professional footballers are of making these judgements in milliseconds. I believe his planted foot position would have been normal for a volley but moved it outward last millisecond as part of plan b.
Damn
I doubt it's a fake but that's still amazing
First top post after the city post not in archives so hi Reddit
CALCULATED!
Unpopular Opinion: I dont care about the premier league, the bundesliga is currently the most interesting league in Europe
No way that's intentional
Oh what the fuck was that
fluke no? prove me wrong
Sure it wasn't accidental?
Looks like he just completely mistimed it and got lucky though? Just me?
That was a smooth accident
I don't know if I am more impressed at the shot or the 24k karma this post got in 3 hours.
Looks like he did it on accident no?
Maybe it was just an accident.
I think you're giving him too much credit
I have a feeling this was not intentional
Not a hope he meant to do that. Complete miskick

u/VredditDownloader
I've watched it like 8 times and I've no idea how he managed to land on his feet afterwards. 

I would snap both of my ankles
Absolutely brilliant and genius technique to avoid the block.
I don´t think the goalie would have caught it anyways but this makes it so much more impressive.
pure filth
Is that what he intended. I have no frame of reference but that was amazing if he actually did that on purpose.
it's so confusing, in my mind i'm still unsure if it was on purpose or not.
Calculated.

I think My ankle just broke watching this.
My Kickbase Team skyrocketed thanks to him
A surprise to be sure but a...
Totally in purpose
*Meta AF*
Scholes did this once, but it was 100% an accident.
Unbelievable
Well it wasn’t technically his standing foot, at the moment of impact neither of his feet were on the ground and *then* after impact that foot became his standing foot.

Mighty impressive, all the same!

I think it's more likely accidental.  Too bad OP only posted in slow motion rather than the full unedited clip first.
he got lucky
Man it took like 5 watches before I realized the initial touch on the ball wasn’t what scored the goal and I kept saying “no the fuck he didn’t”
That is some next level skill.
that might be one of the single most impressive moments of co-ordination and skill ive ever seen. its up there with the berbatov first touch where he killed the momentum of a long crossfield pass with no trouble. bergkamp vs. newcastle levels of skill
Sexy football
That’s not intentional for sure...
Foul.... No two fouls
slick
But the question. Was it intentional?
Mind games
Talk about athleticism and agility. Cheeky.
That is awesome but wonder if intentional or accident lol
Thierry Henry who?
Ok, first of all...that is amazing. Secondly, this is how to do slow motion.
Thierry Henry
Better to lucky than good....
you can do that?
Yeah as if he meant that
The only way this would happen to me is purely by accident but at least I would look like a genius.
 Half back passes to center, back to wing, back to center! Center holds it! Holds it! Holds it!!
fucking cunning!
What a beatiful trick
Wow
The amount of skill needed for a finish like that is so fucking much I’m honestly having a hard time believing it was itebtohakb
so smart, it may actually seem stupid at first glance
Excuse me?
THE CHEEK ON THAT ONE
Good god
Part of me refuses to believe it was intentional, way to good
This requires one of his teammates to come out and say "he does that stuff in training all the time," in order for it to be intentional!
Top bins this
Put this in fifa already
Okayy now that's fucking brilliant
Take my upvote, you son of a gun
Happy accident or genius touch?

Terrible defending all round
Missing great goal tag
Shocking defending from us once again, it's starting to become a theme really. Bowser is supposed to be our best defender and he's jogging outside the box like a 60 year old grandma for fucks sake
Italians are doing monkey chants at him
Waluigi has to do more there for me.
Donkey King and the Italian side to walk off the pitch after he was called a monkey by Finnish ultras
How fucking shit are we to concede in a first minute to a has-been whose prime was during the SNES era?
Look at that fat fuck Eggman trying to let some of the dong expanded glory rub off on him. Celebrating like he did a damn thing to help score.
fantastic cross from Yoshi Benayoun
Yoshi would fit in being a professional Football player. 


He doesn’t pay taxes.
FIFA 2021 looks good. How's the soundtrack?
Shambolic defending by Bowser
the lack of football is going to make us lose our minds won't it
Don’t know if anyone was listening to the English stream but Martin Tyler ruined this goal. Barely reacted at all, I was going totally bananas but he sounded like he was falling asleep. “Yoshi’s cross to Donkey Kong in the box, overhead kick is on target.” Terrible. No enthusiasm whatsoever. Switched to the Arabic stream immediately after.
I wish they’d bring back Super Mario Strikers
So glad he dedicated this goal to Chunky. May he rest in peace.
Shocked they arent even playing behind closed doors.
Great player when he has service, coaches don't build on his strengths (throwing barrels, having a wide extended family, fighting crocodiles who are also part of a monarchy)
Time to make this the most upvoted post on the sub.

Yoshi would fit right in as a footballer with all the fucking tax he's been avoiding.

I swear to god the finnish defence is shambles. Fucking Phil Jones would walk into that defence
People trashing Kong in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Kong. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it's done.
Spurs scouts scrambling to contact his agent.
If donkey kong has million numbers of fan I am one of them. If donkey kong have ten fans then I am one if them. If donkey kong have only one fan that is me. If donkey kong have no fans, that means I am no more on Earth. If world against donkey kong, then I am against the world.
Imagine the havoc he and Fat Sam could wreak on England.
Nani does a little celebratory dance after scoring as Sporting down Loures 2-1.

Take a bow, son.
Where is the match thread?
Hey Waluigi put your fucking hands down. I don't want to see you bitching and moaning about your keeper getting bested by a phenomenal finish when you're putting in a shit effort defending the cross.
This was the peak of r/soccer.
The Italians once again with a Renaissance man up front. I thought Donkey was past it at this stage of his career but he barrelled through that defence
absolute shocking defending by Waluigi, no wonder he's always left out of games.
This sub peaked this day
center backs really switched off there
Keeper needs to do better for me. He's stood still the whole time at his front post. Not taking anything away from the finish though, that's the Donkey Kong power that we fans have become accustomed to throughout his career.
Society has fallen
Pathetic marking, he was free in the box FFS. 

Honestly sack Fergie, sell Giggs I say.
D. Kong is a beast when he’s motivated. It’s just heartbreaking when you realize he’s only motivated 60% of the time and seems to be content to rely on past glories versus staying hungry and putting in the work.
hot take: this goal would never have happened without the absurd galaxy brain of Sonic here.

He’s easily the fastest player on the pitch but yet he STILL holds his run to keep Bowser from tracking Donkey Kong until Yoshi beats Waluigi for pace. The second Yoshi does, Sonic then streaks away from the box, forcing Bowser to commit to covering him, which leaves Donkey Kong unmarked for the finish.

Basically, Sonic was playing 5-D chess while the Finland defense was still reading the instructions on the box.
People trashing Donkey Kong in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Donkey Kong. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it's done.
I'm somehow not getting this?

Could someone explain

That speed in the break was enough but that cross was out of this kingdom

I will never understand Sweden playing that defensively when up a man with ten minutes on the clock.

But also...

FUCKING BANGER
And now, Germany plows thought the rest of tournament and wins the WC.
I can't fucking believe how perfectly telegraphed that shot felt.
Amazing!
Sounds like the world is ending outside right now here in Germany. 

I think I didn't even scream that loud when Götze scored the winning goal in last WCs final.

Just unbelievable. After Brandt hit the post I thought it was over. Now I have a headache from screaming so much. Thought we were done for sure and than Kroos with this banger.

Well maybe this will be the starting point for a great WC for us and we will look at this game as the catalyst. 

Sorry for my ramblings I just needed that after this rollercoaster. 
Nooooooo
With 10 men. The very definition of clutch!! 
The nerves on him man. Last minute and in a world cup match where you can win the game. Cant even imagine how he felt like. What a fucking goal.

Oh my fucking god
OH MY GOD
Kroos just dissed the media and the journalist interviewing him lmao. He was asked what was up with him, why he played so badly. He answered with:

*"sure the first goal is my fault, no ~~questions~~ doubt about it, but then again you have to have the balls to go out there again in the second half and play like I did, but no one talks about that"*

this is now the most upvoted goal on r/soccer of all time
[X] Banger

[ ] Own goal

[X] Late goal

The way he strikes the ball is so sexy
It's 4am here in Singapore and there's tons of supporters for team Germany. The moment this goal happened, the whole football screening room was in an uproar. What an incredible goal. Germany toying with our feelings. 
Oh how the tables have turned lmao
Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.
What a fucking nailbiter that whole game was man. I'm not even that big of a football fan, despite being German, but I screamed my lungs out when Kroos scored. Couldn't have been more perfect.
The only thing that's overshadowing this for me were these two massive douchebags sarcastically clapping at the Swedes after the game. What a fucking disgrace. The Swedes put up a strong and fair fight and were everything but far from winning. Really no reason to be so childishly rude. 
Best assist of Reus's career
What a god 
apology for poor english

when were you when sweden dies?

i was sat at home eating Sauerkraut when Toni ring

‘sweden is kill’

‘no’
#FOOTBALL IS FUCKING AMAZING
22 gold in 20 fucking minutes? Lord
30 golds from excited germany fans. now i understand why people race to have the first post
OMG
Real Madrid players are dictating this tournament whenever they can :O
I was like, fuck they're going short from the fk. Then i understood what they were doing and BANG! Credit to Kroos for going for that and scoring with all the pressure in the world! I guess there's a reason he's won it 4 times! 
Oh my god what a goal 
25 gold holy shit

EDIT: 40!!
Last games for this group are going to be lit 🔥🔥🔥
My restaurant staff in China just lost there shit! And they have zero allegiance to any team, that’s how good that was.
Fuck you Jimmy Durmaz
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Italy didn't qualify for the world cup 
Reus with the touch of God 
Today's mental fortitude was proudly brought to you by Real Madrid Club de Futbol (c)
Jesus christ, gilded 26 times? That's gotta be a sub record
Pure soccer porn.
Un fucking believable.

Que ojete.
2 man wall from there? 
Holy shit the Germans are rich
Orgasmic!
Durmaz gave away some incredibly stupid freekicks... 
He made up for his mistake!  Thats what makes him insaneeeee
OP just got rich
Madrid was gonna snap up some players who tear it up in the world cup, but they're all already on the team
I fell off my couch and milked my cat after this goal.
This dude will have a Reddit gold subscription forever 
They were better without Boateng
Feel *so* goddamned sorry for Sweden. They really gave it their all, and losing like that in the last minute has to be utterly heartbreaking, especially after not getting that penalty in the first half. But at the same time, that was one heck of a victory for Germany, one they should be proud of.
[FC Barcelona] Messi will not renew with FC Barcelona

**"Despite an agreement having been reached between FC Barcelona and Leo Messi and with the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, it cannot be formalised due to economic and structural obstacles (Spanish La Liga regulations)**

“Oh it’s their fucking club site”
ESPN in shambles. They just got the La Liga TV rights here in the States. $1.4 billion over 8 years.
Harry better get his ass back to training.
City trying to refund Graelish right now
Grats PSG. Neymar posted a pic of Messi, Di Maria, Verratti and himself on Instagram the other day while they were all vacationing, lol.
This is crazy... Can't wait to see him in another league, but wow, what will Barcelona be?
Oh **FUCK**
Messi probably has about 50 missed calls from Aguero right now
End of an era.

Meanwhile, didn't Aguero go to Barcelona in order to play with Messi ? That's what I remember reading !
Holy fuck thats a communicado official!
I cant even imagine barca without messi
This is Gareth Bale's league now
City should pull out of the Grealish deal and give the 100m to Messi on a big plate
Grealish joined City just to get benched by Lionel fucking Messi lmao
The end of an era…
Southampton about to announce a hell of a replacement for Ings
What the fuck....
This, right here, is history being written. Cannot imagine seeing Messi in another team’s shirt. Fucking hell.
One of the biggest sports announcements ever
Despite having reached an agreement and with the intention of signing a new contract, it cannot be formalized due to economic and structural obstacles (Spanish LaLiga regulations) 

Despite having reached an agreement between FC Barcelona and Leo Messi and with the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, it cannot be formalized due to economic and structural obstacles (Spanish LaLiga regulations) .

Faced with this situation, Lionel Messi will not continue linked to FC Barcelona. Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of both the player and the Club cannot finally be fulfilled.

Barça would like to wholeheartedly thank the player for his contribution to the enhancement of the institution and wish him the best in his personal and professional life.
What the actual fuck. Barca saw Villa shocked the world with Ings signing and thought this must be topped.
Is it possible this is just a move in a game of chicken with la liga? It seems like they’re blaming him leave on la liga, is there a chance they’ll cave?
Let me absorb this. 

Messi is not playing for Barcelona anymore and they dump that announcement like it’s nothing! 

“Oh yeah the very best player in history is leaving his childhood team, yeah that’s about it.”
Holy shit, I’ll never see Messi play for Barcelona again. Mental.

Even worse the fans won’t get to send off their best player and arguably the best player of all time. That’s got to hurt.

Welcome to West Bromwich Albion though, get yourself down the vine; the curry is good.
Ghost of Barto past
Well fuck me. This is the end of an era and a sad moment for us Barcelona fans.
It says that the deal cannot go through due to La Liga financial regulations. Could it be possible that this is a last ditch threat to get La Liga to change regulations to keep Messi in the league because of the revenue he brings to it? Or is this too much of a stretch?
Holy shit
Will be so weird to see Messi in a different club kit than Barcelona.
Kane replacement sorted then. Good one Spurs.
Plz wake me up this nightmare is getting out of hand
Welcome to Celtic Leo. We will play you at left back.
Heartbroken.
I’m shaking man… what just happened
Aguero: Ah sos re troll
Pep: "Quick kill the Grealish deal gogogogogo."
Poor Kun

I decide to try to stay off this sub to get work done, and all of this happens?
So City bid coming in 3, 2, 1..

Edit: I know now. He's free. So Tottenham it is
Thanks Bartomeu
TIME TO COME TO LS11 AND DO SOME BIELSABALL
Can somebody please find Ja Rule so I can make sense of all this.
EXECUTE ORDER 66
Holy shit, I was here this historic day. Let's find out who played who
Bartomeu must go down as the worst executive in Football History. Took a club idealized around the world and at the pinnacle of world football and turned them into this.
When Phil Coutinho left Liverpool never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be the catalyst for the whole collapse of the team
Wait, what, so Marca was right all along?

So, the odds on him joining Manchester City probably just shortened.
Hahahahahahaha fucking Marca called it
Only thing is I would have liked to be able to say goodbye on the pitch. All the best to him.
Kane is fucked
I know we are all thinking City but this is a Juventus swoop coming if I ever did see one. They are total bastards for the free signing….
Heard he wants to play with Steve Bruce.
MESSI CRISTIANO NEYMAR AT PSG HERE WE GOOO
Harry Kane boycotting training only to be rejected by City.
Holy shit. So, it's gotta be PSG or City, then, right?
Please dont go to City, Please dont go to City, Please dont go to City, Please dont go to City, Please dont go to City, PLEASE DONT GO TO CITY
The most likely outcome is that he stays in my view. Likely this is a chess move to force la liga into making a legal exemption
*Messi scores a billion goals, wins everything and becomes the best player of all time*

Barcelona: "Thanks for your contribution to our institution."
If a Barca fan has a gun with 2 bullets, and has Hitler and Barto in front of them, they would shoot barto twice
End of a massive era!
Just commenting to stay in this historic thread
My guess is that he wants to prove that he can do it on a rainy night in Stoke
As a Barcelona fan I dont think I've ever seen a team mishandle their financial situation this hard in any sport I'm familiar with. 

Barcelona has money that most clubs would kill for yet still over spent so largely on players that ended up being mostly ineffective or just pretty good that they couldn't resign the best player in their history even at a heavy discount.

Absolute clown shoes management over the last five years
YOU FUCKING WHAT
Welcome to Beşiktaş!!!
Messi could be the missing link in City, he could be the CDM pep always wanted
Prediction: He’ll end up at PSG, who will offload Mbappe to Real to make room, and so Perez gets everything he wants, Mbappe and a wing clipped Barca. He’ll pay for an evening with 30 strippers to his servant Bartomeu, who will regret it all the following morning, mounting an attempt to take back control of Barca to “set things right”.
Wait so this means he's leaving for free, right? Fucking hell, should have sold him when he wanted out last year. Literally a multi-million mistake.
Shit just got real. Harry Kane and Levi reading this: I'm in trouble *chuckles

Pep has played a blinder
Holy shit no way
So many comments no one will see that I love sucking toes

Edit: y’all are goated for giving this drunk ass comment awards
Tier 1 for City ruling them out.

ESPN / Disney is probably losing their collective minds after securing the US TV rights for La Liga next year…
Romero and Messi in the same day. Let's go!
Just out of the blue
If I’m getting this right, he’s a free agent so no club needs to submit a bid. Looks like he’s about to get paid like a king?
RIP to the Internet
ENCARA MESSI
As a madrid fan,Thank you messi you're a true goat but fuck you for those painful years!
Holy shit, it's happening
Ahhh so this is why Newcastle haven’t made a signing in this window… saving all the coin for Messi
i just want everyone to know i love my wife.
Okay why isn't any Barca player wishing Leo goodbye. This is definitely a ploy. I'm high on copium, yes. But this doesn't seem right.
Messi convinced Aguero to come to Barca and now he’s bouncing lol

Would not be suprised if he reaches 20 for the tournament. Never believed I would ever say that.
OH MY GODD
Hey future r/soccer user, we’re watching the greatest footballers ever, so no whoever wins the ballon d’or in your time is not the greatest ever, this man and his homie Messi are.
The applause by Juventus fans was awesome too
Zlatan scores what might be the best goal of the week.

Ohhhhhhhh 
Jesus fucking christ

Even the home fans are clapping- WHAT A FUCKING GOAL
80 fucking million pounds. We was robbed.
Where's the NSFW filter ?
Ronaldo just hits God mode in the Champions League
Juve fans applauding the Champions League GOAT. What a goal. 

But Chiellini bby what is you doing?


Mods, don't delete the duplicate so we get 2 of these on r/all
I personally don't like Ray Hudson as I feel he's over the top for almost every goal. But honestly for this specific goal I would have wanted to hear his reaction.
Press F to pay respects
Goal of the season !!
holy shitttt
thats just fucking ridiculous 
You can tell he's been dreaming of scoring this goal for a long time. He's got so much adrenaline at that moment he doesn't even know how to celebrate, he just puts his hands up like "are you not entertained?" but in his mind he's actually like "what the fuck just happened? this isn't real".



Tldr: This goal is special, even by Ronaldo's standards. 
He is the God of the ucl
This is his tournament. Confirmed. 
PUSKÁS!
Buffon did not deserve that. 1st degree murder right there.

Respect to Ronaldo.

We died for this, bois. 
I knew when people were writing off Madrid after Spurs loss, these guys are going to repeat again. Good luck stopping Real Madrid
Looks like this post is heading into legendary territory on this sub. This goal is historic.
The second highest karma points behind Leicester City and well deserved. WHAT A GOAL.
This is basically a glorified backwards tap-in 
Tried this in my backyard.

Instructions unclear broke my spine and faceplated into olive garden. 
Ronaldo browses r/soccer and does the exact opposite of whatever we say
24000 points after 55 minutes...holy shit. 
Legend.
FROSTED TIPS RONALDO IS GOD
Ronaldo pretty much topped Zidane's legendary goal vs Leverkusen. Best goal ever in a CL imo.
Wtf did i just see
WHAT A GOAL
Astonishing
Juve fans applauding it as well, incredible.
\#1 on /r/all after 5 minutes, 10K opvotes in 9 minutes...
I was like "how is this guilded so much and so commented on in such a short space of time?"

Then I saw the goal.

*Damn*
Just going to comment on a piece of football history. Wow I can't believe he scored that, look at the height he gets on that jump. This is a prime example of elite athleticism, elite technique, elite game knowledge. What a player.

What a fucking goal!!!
12 GOLDS!!! NEW r/soccer RECORD!!!

Holy SHIT, one of the most beautiful goals in CL history 
What the fuck
Ronaldo alone has more goals (22) than juventus as a whole (21) in the champions league quarterfinals. 
£80 million. We were robbed.
I'm commenting a month later to tell that this goal lost to Salah's chip against Manchester city for goal of the week.
Fuck me what a goal right after an incredible save.
His positioning is phenomenal. Watch Ronaldo's reaction just as it leaves (probably before) Carvahal's foot. He is quicker than anyone in that box and in his mind he already scored.

Hats off. 
Congrats on the karma OP and top comment, this is going to r/all
Juve fans applause around the ground was something special.
this dude is pretty good i'd say 
Hey didn't Ronaldo mention in one interview a while ago that he never scored a great bicycle kick goal? 

Cmon Reddit find that interview!!!

Years from now people will say where were you on the night Ronaldo won football.

Do you remember when 4 months ago Ronaldo was past it? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
22 minutes old, 13k points and 7 gold lmao

Edit: 15k, 10 gold
Incredible goal, but his first pass was already the right move. He sees the game, always knows where to be. He went from an athletic guy with incredible technique and explosivity, to a slower player with some of the best vision in the world.

People mocked us when we lost, but for the people who've regularly seen us play we weren't weak. Juventus wasn't weak either. It's just that the gap in level between us and this Real is greater than people appreciate.

I actually don't think I've ever seen a team as dominant as that Real under Zidane. While Pep's barça was great and the most enjoyable to watch, this Real team is as strong in the back as it is lethal in the forefront. I mean, look at Ramos' game, it's not even fair
Goodjob Chiellini 
 oh fuck off
RONALDO POR FAVOR FODE A MINHA MÃE PARA EU TER UM IRMÃO VINDO DE TI.
Oh My God.  
I won't even need porn for a week  
I could just watch this all week

He made that look so casual damn
Best player to ever play in the ucl. His record his not comparable with any player in the history of the comp. 
I'm late to the party but just wanted to register myself for this historical post. I was Here When 'The Goal of CL' was scored by Mr. Champions league. 
Ronaldo is a cheat code. 
A horse and a donkey meet in a bar one night, they get chatting and hit it off, the horse invites the donkey back to his place, they go back and all around the walls are pictures of the horse winning the derby, the Guineas, the oaks etc etc. So anyway they have a bang and the horse suggests going to the donkeys house the next weekend, donkey is all up for it but he starts panicking thinking how he’s gonna impress this champion horse, he gets a brain wave and goes the zoo and takes a pic of zebra, so the weekend comes and the horse comes round to the donkeys, he walks in and there’s this massive picture of a zebra on the wall fucking huge taking up a whole wall, “what’s that” say the horse “ah it’s nothing” says the donkey “no tell me I wanna know” says the horse “ah I use to play for Juventus” says the donkey

Redeemed!
Argentina have won their third World Cup title at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar!

The best final of all times?
This game will be talked about for decades, and will go down as one of those legendary games in football history

Be still my heart lol I felt like I was passing out during the final moments
Any way you spin it, no matter who you support, I feel as though Messi winning it in his last World Cup transcends it all. Truly one of the all time greats, a legend, and I am relieved to see him lift the trophy.

Most of the France squad still have a few world cups in them or already have the prize from 2018. Hats off for one hell of a final.
Bruh I lost years in those few hours
I’m just so happy we don’t ever have to engage in dumb conversations about how Messi’s greatness is stained by the lack of a World Cup. Hopefully when he retires we’ll just appreciate him and how special he was for 20+ years.
The English commentary: "Imagine getting a hat trick in a world cup final and not winning... But, then again, football."
Mbappe really the first to score a hattrick in a final and lose
That final was the most stressful, exhilarating, and chaotic football match I've ever seen in my entire life. So glad I was able to witness it. France did amazing coming back from 2-0 down, but props to Argentina for keeping their cool and winning the penalties. I don't think Messi could have asked for a better send-off.
Can we talk about that save by Martinez in the 120th minute? I mean holy shit it so easily could’ve been 4-3 France.
172 goals. This World Cup has had the most goals ever.

Wow.
Mbappe takes the ball, Messi the globe. Congrats Argentina.
Martinez and Otamendi live to die another day
Two best teams. Two best goalscorers. Two best players.

The best match.

This was a real final.
What a final
Messi gets a wizards cloak
What a banger of a game!
Literally one of the best games ever
LMAOOOOO THIS GUYS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
If you get into a penalty shootout against Emi Martinez. You've lost.
This had to be the best WC final bloody hell 

I am gonna miss this. See you guys in 4 years 🫡
Most legendary final I've ever seen. It had everything.
My ass won't witness greatness like this ever again i can't believe it wow wow wow. Unreal game.
argentina really just did snatch victory from the jaws of defeat from the jaws of victory... again
LOTTA KIDS ABOUT TO BE MADE IN ARGENTINA IN THE NEXT 9 MONTHS
Insane final from both teams and both star players
Five headed monster cock
Bono deserves a shout for the Golden Glove but emi martinez winning it is absolutely fair
He did not just do that lmao
Probably the best World Cup final ever, simply phenomenal. Had absolutely everything, just beautiful.
Unreal. What an insane Final and Emiliano Martinez man….. What a performance in the PK + that late ET super save
The commentator on Telemundo is literally crying

Everyone should watch football in Spanish
Bro Martinez out of pocket for that celebration 😂😂
AYO THIS DUDE REALLY DID THAT?
Fox just ended the coverage before the trophy lift to put an NFL game on … what a fucking joke of a network!
Best World Cup final ever.
PSG is gonna be the most toxic workplace on earth after this
I WAS HERE
Saved some goals, gives no fucks
Brighton and Hove Albion have a World Cup winner!!! Feeling like a proud Dad!!! Well done Mac Allister!!!
Emi is absolutely psychotic lol
Mufa Anulo'd
The little boy from Rosario has done it.
When Messi said ‘please trust us’ after they got battered by Saudia Arabia, he wasn’t joking. Congrats to Messi and Argentina
So Tunisia is the only team who defeated France and Saudi Arabia is the only team who defeated Argentina.

When Tunisia vs Saudi Arabia to determine the world champion ?
Emiliano Martinez is unfuckingreal. Clutch save against Kolo Muani and even on that Mbappe missile penalty he almost had it. MOTM.
I was alive to watch the final. This one's for you mom, dad. You were there for the last one. I miss you both.
Despite Argentina's best efforts, they are Champions of the World!
they actually did it. messi actually got the world cup in his last attempt…. you literally couldn’t make it up. can’t believe it. 

and god damn they made them work for it lmao. what a fcking game. they had the lead twice and nearly threw it away only to win on pens in the end. what a rollercoaster for them. 


so happy for messi. congratulations to argentina!
Game of the tournament. Final of all Finals
Emi wildin out in front of the sheikhs love to see it
I have a fucking headache.  Pretty sure my blood pressure is through the roof

But goddamn what a game.  And messi won so I can't be any happier

My best friend lost his dad 2 years ago.  He lived most of his life in Argentina before he moved to the states.  I talked to him how I'd love Argentina to win for my own reasons and I knew how much it would mean to his dad. So we're celebrating extra heavy today
WHAT A HISTORIC GAME, ABSOLUTELY INSANE
Messi was already the goat but this just shuts up all the idiots saying he can't be the goat without a world cup and saying Maradona and Pele are better due to that. Congratulations Argentina they won  the hard way and in true fashion made their fans suffer before getting the win like they like to do. Was supporting Messi and prefer Argentina over France so this is the perfect result
Couldn’t have asked for a better world cup
Missed it because my wife has been in labour! Hope y'all enjoyed
You could see the nerves in the faces of France’s youth/new generation - Tchouaemeni, Camavinga, Thuram - this will be a massive growth for them, and France will continue to be a superpower.

Argentina wanted it way more, and had a brilliant first half and ET. Enzo and Mac Allister impressed me the most, they will be stalwarts in their midfield for years.

Mbappe, take a bow. Holy shit what a player, what a menace. He will be have a stronghold on the Ballon d’or for the next decade.

And lastly, Lionel Messi…first time I watched him was Chelsea-Barcelona 2006 UCL QF. Instantly became my favourite player, followed his career and saw his rise to become the greatest ever. Now he is a world champion. After 2018 I thought we would never see this happen. Fairy tale ending.
Congrats Argentina.

Well done to Argentina ! What a great game even if we lost
Imagine being 23 and being world champion already, and scoring a hat trick in a world cup final.

I mena everybody will focus on Argentina but what a monster Mbappe will continue to be.
NO WAY HE JUST DID THAT
I’m gonna cry holy
Dude casually getting a 30k fine
Have to feel for Mbappe but Emi Martinez is so unreal, so so clutch

Mbappe is like: “Leave me alone”
The most iconic World Cup ever. Messi representing the old generation and mbappe representing the new. How lucky we are to have been able to witness this football moment.
Utmost respect for the referee. Yellow for diving, doesn't flinch for pens and wait for VAR, doesn't give in to weak dives by defenders trying to get free fouls.

In a world cup final, what a boss.
What a game
I was here for this. Holyyyyy
That was the greatest world cup final ever
Not being sarcastic, but someone should really check on Ronaldo. Officially lose the GOAT debate, his rival won WC, while he is without a team. Tough tough situation for a guy with his ego
As a French I am so proud of my boys! They went from boring defense to almost winning, against a monumental and amazing Argentinian team.

I am proud for all Argentinian. Well played!

It was one of those match of the century!
“When she’s that pretty you… definitely sneak in a kiss” *shit what did I just say?*
Always respect those who don’t take off the silver medal
Macron in love with Mbappe
Mbappe really doesn't seem to appreciate Macron being up in his space.
Lmfao the emir fully said "king shit" to Messi
Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become *the* best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in 2014 but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.

He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.

He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.

They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up 2-0 and dominate France for a good 75 minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike 2014 this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.

Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...

His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins *the* trophy.

If this isn't the story if the main character of football then I don't know what is.
Fucking fox showing NFL bullshit.
French here.

Congratulations to Argentina!

Mbappé is from another level.

Without Benzema, Kante and Pogba, we lose on penalties. 

Still amazed by how many top youths keep coming in our NT.
Lmao this guy
LMAOAOOAOAOAO HE PUT THE GLOVE ON HIS CROTCH
Why does Messi have a wizard robe on?!
M'bappe definitely didn't want to talk to macron that much nor when he got his individual award either.
Today I feel argentine
Bro telemundo commentator is sobbing. The love for Messi is so real
[deleted]
Argentina Anulo’d their last Mufa
Argentina is a great champion. They outplayed our team during 75 minutes. The rest is history. No bitter feellings against our boys, considering all the injuries (Pogba Kante Benzema Nkunku Hernandez…), considering the flu or whatever it was just before the final, considering the game itself… they have my respect and gratitude.
The worst and best match ever. So much suffering. I died 2 times.  
  
Mbappe took his time to appear, but when he did he pulled his team to over time with sheer class. His second goal was a masterpiece of technical hability.  
  
Argentina, thank you. We were the better team, but we suffered because that's what this game is all about.  
  
We should have won it in regulation, we should have lost it in over time with that last shot from France. Thank you Dibu for that Handball save at the last moment, and then again in the panalty shootout.  
  
## Vamos Argentina. Somos Campeones del Mundo
**SAUDI ARABIA ARE (transitive) WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS!**

But really though, what an all-time classic
Although they dropped a lead twice, Argentina were the better team today and finally Messi has gotten his deserved World Cup title. This must’ve been an such emotional rollercoaster for the Argentinian fans. My heart was racing as a neutral. The final really summed up Argentina’s road to the final too. A lot of drama, a lot of ups and downs, but in the end Argentina managed to win. What a final and what a win
This was the **FINAL.** I don't think I've ever witnessed an international game like this. Let's see:

* From Argentina's 36 game unbeaten streak to losing the first WC match to Saudi to mounting a come-back and defeating everyone on the way to the final, led by Messi.
* From France's dominance in every game leading up to the final, led by Mbappe. Despite missing Kante, Pogba and Benzema. Written off initially but went through their games unphased.
* Argentina dominating the first 75 minutes while France couldn't get their bearings before two successive goals from Mbappe to equalize. Messi with a last minute shot that Lloris saves like a beast.
* Messi coming clutch in ET to snatch the lead once again on the heels of a rejuvenated France before Mbappe converted yet another penalty in the 118'. Martinez with another clutch save as well.
* After 2 successive comebacks, a penalty shoot-out where, Argentina, despite all signs pointing towards a mental choke having come this far manages to convert all their penalties while Martinez pulls off yet another elite PK performance.
* Messi winning the WC in his last ever WC appearance, after willing his team to a final and scoring 2 goals in the final. Safe to say he's the undisputed modern-era GOAT and can finally rest knowing he's won it all.
* Mbappe showing us why he's one of the future greats and an absolute phenom. A hat-trick in the final. Literally the only thing that stood between Argentina and the trophy. To have 11 WC goals in 2 WC's having already won one and nearly single-handedly winning another at the age of 23 shows why he is truly elite. I truly feel bad but excited to see this guy break records.
* GK's showing why they matter. Both Lloris and Martinez were fucking immense. Penalties are always a tough one but being able to make critical saves in open-play and in shoot-outs is testament to how good these guys were today.

Truly an emotional roller-coaster and an insane WC final from what most thought was a one-sided game. But that's why this is the best **fucking game** and no sport will top it for me.
Thats jail time bois
Okay but can Messi win the MLS cup?
That was an insane final
Man, infantino really inserting himself into everything lol
Messi finally stands with Maradona for Argentina.
And that concludes the Annus horribilis for CR7
6 years ago, Messi almost wanted to quit playing for the Argentina NT when they lost to Chile in the Copa America final.

Now, he has just won the 1 trophy which he needed to complete football.

NEVER GIVE UP.
I don't know if these players are as friendly with Macron as he seems to think they are.
EA Sports busy creating a robe skin for Messi to charge people $20 for.
What a fucking match, I'm so happy for Messi
Mbappe is going to be a World Cup legend. Tchouameni, Mbappe, Dembele, Kolo Muani, Camavinga, Upa, Theo. They're gonna be favorites for years to come.
Messi deserves it no doubt, but that was the hugest hard carry by Mbappe if I've ever seen one too. Hat-trick, including scoring all 3 penalties in a Final is an insane solo effort wtf.
Fuck yea
I pity people who don't like this sport. One of the best finals I've ever seen, probably *the* best.
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA EMI
Bdbshahhaiikss
Well, he's getting arrested.
Martinez knows the snizz is coming tonight
GREATEST WORLD CUP FINAL IN HISTORY!!!!!!
Seeing the greatest footballer of all time finally get what he deserves is so satisfying. 

Felicidades a mis hermanos y hermanas en Argentina, saludos desde Suecia <3
did the golden boot trophy just break? lol
Piers Morgan in fucking shambles
Lots of heart medication needed in France and Argentina
It's finally over Messi has completed football
Best game ever
WHAT A FINAL, WOW!
lmao
Sheikh Messi
Beyond WC this has the potential to be seen as one of the best football games in history.
Not just the best final. It is one of the greatest matches ever played, my god
ANULO MUFA REQUIEM
2006: Zidane gets a draw through a Penalty kick against Italy, France loses on the penalty shootout.

2022: Mbappé gets 2 penalties and gets a draw. The game goes to the penalties. Most Argentines are of Italian descent.

It was over the moment the game started.
Wish Macron would fuck off, it’s not about him it’s about the players
Man, imagine being Mbappe and having to stick around for a half hour to pick up a shoe.
The Qatar Sheikh is fucking huge.

Zidane subbed him in 3 minutes ago. He scores 2 goals. Genius
It would be hard to even dream that goal - insanity 
Ronaldo??
This has to be some of the worst goalkeeping in a champs final in a LONG time. 
Fuck, that’s wild
Headlines will 100% be “Madrid Bale’d Out By Welsh Winger Wondergoal”.
Golden touch!! What a goal!!!

Dare I say better than Ronaldo’s 
I made the exact same sound as that commentator when I saw that. It's like a primal scream, that goal was just so bloody good.
I can't even do that in Rocket League fuck me
Ronaldo is fucking jealous 
Lmao they call him the Monkey King in China. They knew what was up. 

Also, Gareth Bale has as many CL medals as Lionel Messi. 
Pretty sure Ray Hudson is 90% liquid now
Saw this goal happen as I walked into a Mexican restaurant. Waiters and kitchen staff and me all lost our shit when that happened.
That goal was sublime. I could not believe it, in the final as well.
What a goal.

hello bale my old friend
Just here to post on this once in a lifetime thread
Should have passed it to the guy Ronnie...
I love you Bale.
No idea how Bale gets benched so often. World class player who is capable of amazing football. If RM don’t offer this man a new contract soon, those transfer rumors may finally come to fruition. 
I think this is going to hit 50k
Just WOW
