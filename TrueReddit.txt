Millennials only hold 3% of total US wealth, and that's a shockingly small sliver of what baby boomers had at their age

>But it's not all bad news. Jason Dorsey, president of The Center for Generational Kinetics, previously told Business Insider it's possible for millennials to catch up financially thanks to a baby-boomer inheritance, low unemployment rates, and good savings habits.

This is not very good news for people without rich families.
Giving a sizable voting population the raw end of the economic deal seems like a recipe for change. Here’s hoping...

I had an annoying conversation with my mother in law last weekend when she was trying to tell my wife that she could be a stay at home mom if we really wanted her to. We don't have kids currently, but were talking about the financial difficulties that we would face. She wouldn't believe that my salary as a teacher barely covers our most basic expenses and kept saying that "if you didn't go out to eat as often or cut down on your other spending you could make it work." I don't understand how it is so difficult for her generation to understand.
There is so much effort to make this a "BOOMERS VS MILLENNIALS DEATHMATCH 2000 !!!!1!!one!!" when in fact is it the top 1% - the ultra rich - who have cornered a shockingly large percentage of the wealth, which they are taking at the expense of EVERYBODY ELSE. Not just Millennials. Gen X'ers and lots of boomers too.     
     
But the rich own the news outlets. And they sure aren't going to report that they are taking all the wealth. So gotta make it a throwdown between generations.
It's because they're lazy and entitled and have pink hair, right?

But seriously, Millenials run the risk of forever hardship and can't make any mistakes. The Recession really* hurt poor boomers, for everyone else, the bottle rocket of 2013 sent their 401k, home prices and every other investment to the moon. And now, instead of being taxed, uppper middle class + boomers are just trying to keep that bottle rocket going. 

This insane inequality is the best case for a complete tax overhaul, or just a reset to what the boomers had and destroyed.
Submission statement:

>When boomers were roughly the same age as millennials are now, they owned about 21% of America's wealth, compared to millennials' 3% share today, according to recent Fed data. 

Baby boomers are outpacing the Silent Generation in terms of wealth as they age into retirement, while millennials and Gen X are lagging behind boomers as they age.

Millennials are financially behind as they struggle with increased living costs, the fallout of the recession, and student-loan debt, but it's possible they can catch up.
Na the boomers will burn up all that’s left on healthcare on they’re way out.
I wonder what percent of that 3% is held by a few tech billionaires.
I’m waiting on my boot straps growing in
It’s definitely fucked up that my plan for my future is waiting for my parents to die so hopefully I inherit a retirement plan.
For those of us who feel somehow cheated, I think it makes more sense to blame the billionaires instead of the Boomers. The game IS fixed after all and wealth inequality has been steadily rising since the mid 70's.
That's it.
Promote more polarization between us peasants.
That way, we will ignore the REAL CAUSE of this wealth disparity, which is the wealth transfer away from both the Boomers AND Millennials to the oligarchs.  Oh.  And let's also recognize that the military-industrial complex also drains the wealth available to us peasants.
So you should see the game foisted on you, my friends.  That is, domestic propaganda  -- controlled by corporations and the Pentagon's Department of Perception Management -- intends us to fight among ourselves instead of fighting against our real oppressors.
Wake up !!
This article may be misleading if the relative proportion of the population that each generation (or age group) had at a given time is different. The argument would be stronger if it was normalized to the population size.
You'd almost think that after the Greatest Generation did everything to make sure their kids could prosper, all those Boomer kids did everything they could to make sure they kept all of it or something.
In the Netherlands, people between 65 and 75 hold a third of the wealth, while people between 35 and 45 only hold 10%
Should look at median numbers, because those, like actually reflect the state of most people.
So can we say it?  Our parent's stole our futures and now they are blaming us for it.  Thanks Boomers.
Wow.  So it turns out when the government entirely subsidizes a generation from cradle to grave to move up economically, they move up economically.  And when the government stops subsidizing people and instead uses neoliberal economics to cut taxes and cut government spending, people don't move up economically.  I am SHOCKED!
Just curious, why is it that people are just now engaging in this culture war between Boomers and Millennials?
Millennials are also more educated, and the changes are related. There also seems to be a higher expectation of being able to call on parents for financial help, so less point in saving.

I’m not sure how much all this really matters. The median net worth today is $100K, a small amount compared to the $1.5M or so median lifetime income. It’s not nothing, but I think a much more relevant metric would be “future spending power”, which takes into account both equity and labor income. I’d consider a 75-year-old with $300K in the bank plus social security probably toward the bottom of middle class, and a new CS grad with $50K in debt and $150K income low-grade rich. These oversimplified measures can’t capture that.
"Surprise"
I just did some quick and dirty calculations and came up with Baby Boomers possessing almost 20x more wealth per capita than Millenials.

Can someone punch me in the face to make sure I am not dreaming?
That's why they call them baby boomers they are babies who's mommy's and daddy's gave them the world and like brats they destroyed it and the boomer part is the sound of the earth exploding...boooom
We get that things are unequal but I don't see how the statistic is inherently bad.  How does wealth inequality affect my life. I go to work and make a living for myself. Other people being rich does not harm me.
So in 1989 25-43 year olds  (18 year span) had more money than 23-38 year olds today (15 year span). Also note where those extra years are - on the high end, meaning they've had more time to pay off loans, etc and accumulate wealth. Adding to this, consider demographics; after ww2, a lot of people died, and then a lot of people got pregnant.  So relatively, there were a lot of babies in the 1940's, and not so many adults. Fast forward to 1989, where our first comparison takes place - adults in the 25-43 range simply vastly outnumber their parents, who after several bloody wars and various epidemics may simply have died off, leaving their amassed wealth to their children. Now looking at today - the parents of 23-38 year olds are likely still alive, and they had much better contraception. As a result - fewer children. There hasn't been a WW2, Vietnam, etc; medicine has gotten vastly better, so the sick aren't dying and passing large sums of wealth onto the children they do have. So when you compare this smaller, younger group with their parents at a somewhat similar age, there are tons of other factors that go into it.

This is what is referred to amongst statisticians as "cherry-picked bullshit". Is it true? Probably, to some extent, but so many other confounding factors that were not controlled for prevent a more accurate - and less click-baity - conclusion.
guess they are ahead in compounding interest
Yeah but like how much of the national debt do we hold?
Isn’t zuckerburg a millennial?
"When boomers were roughly the same age as millennials are now, they owned about 21% of America's wealth, compared to millennials' 3% share today, according to recent Fed data. "
So an entire generation holds as much total wealth as we export each year in blood?
Remember that this is percentage of total US Wealth and so the massively increased concentration and growth of US Wealth at the top end due to global expansion is a major cause of this.  Remarkably few Millennials are in the .1 percent.
They have likes, followers, upvotes and influencers.
It would be really awesome if they showed up at the voting booth to elect politicians with more equitable tax policies.
Damn this is dumb. 

Differences:

*  have absurd student debt due to falling for the trap of "you need college"
* get into workforce at a later time in life (whereas boomers were typically working before or soon after highschool full time)
* Housing Crisis and incompetent president /national policy caused a recession messed with employment rates for 3-4 years
* millennials opt for HIGHER taxes in voting habits, as do boomers as they age, meaning less retained wealth.

Fucking idiotic article.
And as these Boomers die, do you think that money just evaporates?
This is why they've made America a better, cheaper place, forcing businesses to adopt no fee approaches to things they used to charge for. Thanks Millenials! You guys rock!!
Speaking in percentages... have we considered that there might just be more wealth in America today?
I think I see a problem with this article. If you go to the government data, it's defaulted to %. If you click on $, you see a different picture. I think using percentages is skewing the picture. 

I think the problem is this. Using percentages distorts things because 1% of 5.6 trillion dollars GDP in 1989 is not the same as 1% of  85 trillion dollars GDP in 2018.  1989 population was 246 million. 2018 population was 327 million.  Using percentages skews the data in a way that makes the data less useful. Those numbers came from google.

The basic story is population grew by 30% from 1989 to 2018, while GDP from 15 times. 

As a boomer, I can attest to how much easier it was for me to pay for college. A full time, minimum wage job could pay for a degree from UCLA in the 1970's. I can attest to how easy it was to find jobs; just walk around any business park and look for help wanted signs, or ask random strangers at the gas station on Fridays if they knew of anyone that was hiring. I agree with the sentiment of the article. I just don't think the data in that chart tells a useful or accurate story.

Given the productivity gains, the logical answer is Universal Basic Income, realistic Federal minimum wage, Universal healthcare, and universal education. That is a rational investment for the country to make. Who is more productive for their society; someone filled with uncertainty about the next meal for their family or someone focused on finding their best fit within a team on a level playing field.
3% is this a hard figure or just being trotted out in the headline to attract clicks? That’s a scary low amount for a generation that now outnumbers all other generations.
They're called Boomers because they were born in a 'Baby Boom' period. That means there were a lot more Boomers than any other previous generation. It makes perfect sense that Boomers held a lot of wealth compared to the rest of the population at the time.
The article reeks of confusing the Gini coefficient (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) with basic standards of living. It's possible to have less income inequality and still live in poverty.

While I dislike income inequality and per capita poverty rates, simply pointing at the share of a nation's wealth isn't  the way to fix it.

But then again this is part of the author's bio.

> Hillary joined Business Insider in 2018 reporting on personal finance for the Your Money section. She got her start in the luxury world as an associate editor at Boat International Media writing about superyachts and the people who work on them. 

But in  her defense, her BS is in PR and not economics, mathematics, or sociology.
One of the explaining forces I don't think very many people are taking into account in their rush to make their pet political cause the solution to this is that when the boomers were gen z's age, medical care was pretty rudimentary and the average age that their parent was dying at was much lower than the average age that our parents are dying at.  The huge advances in medical care are at least partly an explanation for these statistics.
They suffered through 8 years of Obama disaster, what do you expect?

Unemployment at 50+ years low and wages rising now. Yay!
"shockingly"

lol okay
Boomers raise prices so they can increase their profits, at the expense of the children their generation raised. They are choking their children out so they can live better. When does the relief come? When the parents die and their children receive the inheritance? What is that teaching us?
There a lot of interesting factors, but what I see not being mentioned once is the outside forces impacting western markets by design like Globalization. 

I don't blame or even hate globalization, but I think we honestly have to factor this in as to why wealth magically did not shift over from one generation to other like it always had. In the past 30 years we seen poverity world wide decrease by the millions, but we also seen investors pump money into these growing markets. This means that money that would normally be invested into a local or country economy are now being invested in different countries.

I don't think this is a overall bad thing, but I think us as Millennials need to face a hard reality that our promised inheritance is being to given to someone else and we need create our own wealth and get better education finances.
White vs black.   

Gay vs straight.  

Rich vs poor.  

And now...   

Young vs old.   

Anything to divide ourselves. “It’s our parents fault we don’t have more money! Not the governments! Let’s whine about old people and do literally nothing to change anything!”
Get a better job slackers
Yah...there were also only 3 billion people on the planet. Now there is 7 billion. Stop blaming boomers.
Give it about 5 years
Ok
What is it that millennials complain about most? Two boomers had sex 30+ years ago, Now millennials have to work everyday to feed and house themselves...

May you get as much praise and attention on your birthday as millennials feel they're entitled to every day...
My Family’s Slave - She lived with us for 56 years. She raised me and my siblings without pay. I was 11, a typical American kid, before I realized who she was.

This was a really, really good piece - kind of shocking that this stuff is still going on here...
Excellent piece by a Pulitzer Prize–winning author who himself died a few days before publication.
Thanks for sharing this very touching story. It's not often that I see a story on Reddit, so compelling, that I would read an entire lengthy article. 
That was a great read.  Its sad to think that people were still enduring this treatment in the late 20th Century.  

I had a Filipino friend in high school, whose parents were first gen here in the States, they had a "house keeper" as well and that was in the 90's.  Not sure if it was at the same level as this, but the more I think about it the more it seems to match up.  I think she eventually went home to the Islands, but I'm not sure.  

It always left me with questions when I saw her,  now possibly a few answers..



What a revelation for a kid to have to come to terms with, that your parents could do such a thing!  

Something like that is so damaging, although it was such a beautiful gift he gave her by making her final years memorable and so comfortable.  

Such an amazing story.

Another The Atlantic piece by the same author from 2016:
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/in-the-land-of-missing-persons/471477/
When I read the comments I was shocked that so many people didn't know things like this still happened.  My great-grandmother had a woman who lived with her for the majority of my grandmother's life.  She was "Aunt Trudy Mae."  My brother and I were in love with her on infrequent visits to the "Deep South" from "Up North."  She had a different last name than everyone else.  Her son had the same last name as everyone else.  My great-grandfather had moved her in when she became pregnant at 12.  He died two years later.  She stayed. Forever.

Wow, that was fascinating, a true credit to and embodiment of the purpose of this sub. 

The difference in culture and mindset in that story reminds me of my favorite book: *The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down*, by Anne Fadiman, which I recommend to everyone. Culture clash is ultimately the topic explored by this book but the story it uses as the vehicle is fascinating. It's the story of an epileptic Hmong girl and her immigrant family in California and their interaction with the American medical system, and more importantly the American mindset. Or more like the reverse - you as the reader trying to understand the first-wave Hmong immigrant mindset.

You think that everyone on earth shares certain assumptions and realities and that they are not mutable, while understanding that we differ an all sorts of less fundamental things. But what a story like *Spirit* shows you is how wrong you are about some of the basic fundamental realities embedded deeply within different cultures. Reality is literally different from culture to culture and this book helps show you how fundamental that can be. One of the most advanced cultures in the world clashes with one of the least at that point - Hmong hill tribe people from Laos, who lived in dirt-floor huts and had shamans and believed in malevolent cave spirits and helped the US in the Secret War in Laos during the Vietnam War.

The fascinating thing is that early in the book you're convinced that it's a tragedy how the girl's parents' culture views epilepsy as some kind of gift within their mythology, and how they don't follow the doctor's instructions, and how fish-out-of-water they are in the modern world. And it seems crazy that they don't put her in some kind of care facility once she's good and fried by her seizures. It seems like criminal neglect and maybe it is even still. But after a while as you consider the differences between these two cultures and how they treat people, you find yourself swaying toward their side, and wind up ultimately unsure what is right and good and best. 

That's important more for what it makes you ask yourself about your own perspective than what it says about anyone else's. My perspective has never been changed more substantially by any book. It feels like a great stroke of luck to me that I even heard about it. It has affected my understanding of people greatly, and not just across nationalities and races, but across other forms of culture, which you may not realize includes things like generation, gender, class, subregion, religion, politics, rural vs. urban, etc. Everybody is a member of innumerable overlapping cultures, each of which comes with a standard rulebook for reality, and the unconscious assumption is always that everyone is reading from the same rulebook, which means we wind up calling penalties on people all the time for infractions they've committed against rules that aren't in their book and that they don't know they're supposed to be following. This is the root of culture clash and this book helps you understand just how different someone's conception of reality can be, and how different a given concept, gesture, role, action, etc. that is common to you both can look through that different lens. Check it out! (library puns - I got 'em all day, baby)
Very sad and amazing article.  
I'm really interested in all of the responses this thread is getting, especially the more visceral disgust and contempt some of you have for the author and his family.

I'm a Filipino American, and while my family never owned a slave I drew some strong parallels of my own with this story, especially with my own lola (grandmother). Some of you are wondering why the author remained complicit. 

I could heavily sympathize with the author because I could understand the nuances (and some of the glaring flaws) in Filipino culture, while growing up in America. He doesn't fully grasp Lola's situation until he's a teenager, and even from the extreme verbal abuse he witnesses from his parents (not directed at him obviously) he does, with shaking voice, stand up for his Lola.

He gets into a screaming match with his mother about her treatment of Lola as a slave, and this is when we actually see the "click" of realization from his mother. His mother never really thought of Lola as a slave, just someone that *exists*. You can tell she hasn't really grasped the role Lola plays in her life because it is so inherently normal (to her) to have someone like Lola, who acted as a wet nurse, and then her nanny when she produced children. She mentions with venom that the author will never understand the relationship her and Lola have, which suggests the conflicting emotions and skewed balance of power Lola and his mother share. She feels resentment towards Lola for having the love her of children, and by the time she's dying she's trying to make amends for the way she treated her. It's petty and gross that she decides to try fix things when she's actively dying--but that's what happens.

As to "why didn't you call the police, or let Lola go?" She didn't want to go. She had nowhere else to go, his family was her family *too*. A good chunk of her own family died in extreme poverty or because of illness; she had nowhere to go. He did what would make a lot of sense to Filipinos, and that was to have her stay with him. He never used her as help as an adult because she was his lola (grandmother), he saw her as blood, and provided for her as best he could in adulthood. He gave her money, applied for citizenship, and sent her back to an extended vacation to her old village, while nice wasn't her home anymore. Her home was with Alex and his family. She helped out of habit, and out of love. In the end she did live out her life happily, and that I think was the best possible outcome for her. 

The story is messy, and it hurts, and it can leave you raw. But it was his Lola's story, and it was his. It's easy to point fingers, but I think he did the best he could out of his situation. He loved and adored his Lola, and she him. It was beautiful, I think. A lovely tribute for a strong and loving woman. 


**There is some irony here in that "Lola" isn't just a name but also translates to "Grandmother" in Tagalog.** Perhaps I missed it-I was wondering if and when the author was going to make this revelation. Knowing this made the article a little more impactful.


For about 11 years, I grew up with live in nannies and helpers. They were common to the middle and upper class. Usually just cleaned, cooked, and did laundry. This story seemed like it was based off the stuff I used to see see in Soap Operas (evil rich people abusing poor people). 


The worst thing that happened to Lola was being taken to a different country where escape was not a given option. I won't be surprised if this behavior is a lot more common here in the States. I might have read it from this sub as I remember reading a similar article about a Pakistani family who "owned" a slave girl.
An amazing, heart-wrenching piece. I'm just in awe, and in shock. 
This was a painfully good article. It made me at-least somewhat happy for Lola that the last 11 years of her life were spent with something like real freedom and family. 
>She was 18 years old when my grandfather gave her to my mother as a gift

>My father had a law degree, my mother was on her way to becoming a doctor

What's *really* scary about this story is that this is the kind of attitude that the super-rich get towards the poor in a society where a huge gap between rich and poor is completely normal. 

The gap is growing in the U.S., and many are struggling against it. But when wealthy people as a class stop caring about the rest of their countrymen and women—watch out.  
This is a pretty great article. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the author (I realized he recently passed, but I'm ignoring that).

Obviously there was no great solution, but guy essentially got a big leg up in life because of the fact their family had a slave, and he manages to come off as sympathetic, but never quite does anything about it until his own mom dies. Then uses her story to get a major story in a nationally prominent magazine. Including personal details like she never had sex. Feels a bit wrong, even though I recognize that the story should be told, and its "complicated"

** **edit**  **It was pointed out to me that the author did not know it was to be a cover story , so I just changed it to "a major story" **edit** **
This is so beautifully written!
[There is a very beautiful film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqtITxxMZvc) that deals with a similar subject called Ilo Ilo.
[deleted]
Unexpectedly I was really moved by this. The author did a great job at describing the situation, conveying emotions. It was hard to read. 
For her sake, I hope she's in a better place.
This really hits home, and hard. 

My family had a similar situation, but all of the kids were unwanted extramarital children discards. People would bring them to us and without a word, lola took them in.

When she was old and frail, blood relatives vanished but the adopted kids lola raised as her own were more family to her than her real kids. Just before she died she took in one last child, who is now twelve. Lola made sure she got a uniform and went to school. 

I've been staring at my screen for the past hour remembering her. She is deeply missed by hundreds of people, with no exaggeration.
Sobbing so hard I had to take a break in order to finish reading this piece. 

A lovely, lovely tribute to a dedicated soul. 

RIP, Lola.
Without rule of law human beings are often horrible to each other. This is not a thing in the past.  It's happening right now as a direct result of actions the United States took in libya. 

“The latest reports of ‘slave markets’ for migrants can be added to a long list of outrages [in Libya],” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM’s head of operation and emergencies. “The situation is dire. The more IOM engages inside Libya, the more we learn that it is a vale of tears for all too many migrants.”

The north African nation is a major exit point for refugees from Africa trying to take boats to Europe. But since the overthrow of autocratic leader Muammar Gaddafi, the vast, sparsely populated country has slid into violent chaos and migrants with little cash and usually no papers are particularly vulnerable.

One 34-year-old survivor from Senegal said he was taken to a dusty lot in the south Libyan city of Sabha after crossing the desert from Niger in a bus organised by people smugglers. The group had paid to be taken to the coast, where they planned to risk a boat trip to Europe, but their driver suddenly said middlemen had not passed on his fees and put his passengers up for sale."

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration
Holy shit.  I'm stunned. 
Holy fucking shit. That was so well written that I cried. Those boxes of memories Lola saved hit something deep within me.
Heavy. There's so much to process.  This woman...the patience and Zen she must have had. Can you imagine how full of a soul she could have been, had she been free? This is a net loss for life as a whole.
I had no idea how hard that ending hit me. It didn't even sound too complex or anything, but it ends the story amazingly. What a life. 
A horrible story; that poor woman held in captivity like that for her entire life.   I feel like the author was looking for sympathy by writing the piece but I have nothing but rage over the entire affair.   Those people stole that woman's life and her piety made her think c'est la vie.  What a shitty, horrible, disgraceful way to treat a human being.
i dont usually comment , but the immense sadness and sorrow in this piece obligates me to write something as an appreciative gesture for such a great piece
It is gut wrenching to see how the trials and tribulations of our comfortable lives pale in comparison to the kind of life Lola led. 

It seems like everything that Alex Tizon did for Lola was some or the other form of atonement for all that she had to go through when she was with his parents. 

Like /u/dec8ur said, I may or may not have shed a tear reading this piece.
The author died unexpectedly in March. He was a huge figure at the University of Oregon.
This was the most interesting thing I've read in a very long time.  I'm not sure what exactly to take away from this but I am very happy that I read it.  

The Author did an amazing job writing this.  Thank you. 
Fascinating and moving story - wonderfully told. 

My only complaint was reading on mobile, it was difficult to determine if the photos were with the story, or with an ad.
I read this earlier, heartbreaking story. Shocking to hear of such things still happening in the USA, which means there are likely other stories of this happening. 
Applying modern morality to practices of the past makes it easy to pass judgement, but it's important to keep in mind that slavery was the *de facto* way of life for a majority of human history. The weak and the vulnerable made natural targets for slavery, and the practice wasn't limited to any particular race or religion, nor did people hesitate to make slaves of other people from their own country. It wasn't even until the late 1600s that the idea that slavery could possibly be immoral started to become mainstream. It was through consistent and concerted effort by the British spanning the 18th and 19th centuries that the foundations of slavery were slowly eroded throughout the Western world, and slavery persisted as a legal institution in India, China, and other far-east countries until around the turn of the 20th century. America's civil war was a historically unique way to end slavery -- for most countries it was due to economic and military pressure imposed by the British Empire.

I don't really have a point other than to say while this story is probably shocking to most people alive today, it's not very surprising from a historical perspective.

Wow, this is incredible journalism that really alters my view of the issue. I have seen statistics for human trafficking and slavery in the United States before this, but they never really registered. How could tens of thousands of people be enslaved in the USA, a country that embodies freedom?

My view of slavery in America was the "kidnapped and locked in a basement" form that you hear on the news (e.g. Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Georgina DeJesus), not mistreatment over decades leading to individuals accepting the situation as normal. I can now see how human psychology and lack of understanding your surroundings could be just as effective as a ball and chain.

The scary thing is that the "kidnapped and locked in a basement" form of slavery seems insane, incredibly uncommon, and extremely likely to end in life in prison while quite frankly I don't know most of the families on my street well enough to know that the situation in this article doesn't apply to them.
Heart wrenching, totally heart wrenching.
Been a while since I read something that length, neither fictional nor academic, without skimming.

Worth it.
Listening to the audio reading of this made me cry several times.
Not even half way through and I am seething here.
>You must embrace your role as the giver of commands. You must keep those beneath you in their place at all times, for their own good and the good of the household. They might cry and complain, but their souls will thank you. They will love you for helping them be what God intended.

Fucking shit fuck.

Sorry, I know that doesn't contribute to the conversation, but jesus christ.
That was powerful. Really really powerful.
First time I've read a Reddit article in while and I'm happy I did. 
Great piece. Thank you for linking this. 
Wow. That is an amazing story and so well written.  Simply amazing. 
This absolutely blew me away. Thank you for sharing. 
Reading this was the first time I cried in a while. Don't know what to say. 
This was so painful to read.. 
As a Filipino who was born and raised in the Philippines, "cultural context" is the worse excuse a Filipino can make in attempt to try to avoid any criticism. If ever, outside criticism should be welcomed.
The attitude of the Tizon family to Miss Pulido is pretty much the unsavory culture of the Filipino elite. I feel for Alex since he came from an effed up and unloving family. The only one who seemed to love him truly was their slave. His parents were all for the "image" they project to outsiders -- a common culture of the Filipino elite. It doesn't matter if you are rotten to the core, as long as you look good outside. This attitude/characteristics is shared by the scummy Filipino politicians.
Non-elite or common Filipinos need to stop excusing this attitude of the Tizon family (an attitude also found among the arrogant Philippine elites) and aspect of Philippine life if they want the Philippines to really move forward. Families like the Tizons/Asuncions is one reason why the Philippines remains a poor country, with a GDP of only $2,500 and poverty rate of 25%, and an HDI of mere 0.66.
Not only was Tizon's piece a reflection of slavery. It was also of human trafficking, power play, and taking advantage of the weaker people. Heck, even Filipino diplomats have been caught engaging in human trafficking and modern day slavery. A Filipino diplomat in the Middle East was sexually trafficking and soliciting distressed OFWs. A Filipino diplomat in the US was caught abusing the "nurse" they brought -- it was found that he and his family turned her into a maid! Two Filipinos in Paso Robles CA were caught smuggling Filipinos to work as underpaid workers in a care giving facility.
What really is there to defend? Are Filipinos really willing to defend such atrocities done by Filipinos against Filipinos...for the sake of, what, "saving face" and "looking good"?
While the word "katulong" means helper literally, it bears many negative connotations. The phrase "Katulong ka lang" (you're just a maid) is often used to remind people of their "lowly status". The term "mukha kang katulong" (you look like a maid) implies that you are "very ugly"(meaning: very native-looking and not mestizo-looking). After all, did not Ms Pulido say once to Alex "Katulong lang ako" (I'm just a servant/helper). It is very evident here that the Tizon parents were able to successfully let Ms. Pulido know of her "lowly status" in the hierarchy. That her only goal in life is to serve the Tizons. She was lead to believe she has no agency for herself, and that "fatalism" is a virtue.
That is how Alex Tizon's maternal family effed up. I'd like to know how his paternal side was, but he never shared it.
If the Tizons were not Filipinos, would Filipinos here accept "cultural context" as an excuse for the abuse and human trafficking committed in the story? If they were a Saudi family, will they accept the excuse that in their culture women are third class citizens who do not deserve basic rights, so the should not complain about maltreatment of Filipino maids?
In one short brush stroke the author has painted all of humanity.  
What an incredible piece. 

I hope every piece of shit scumbag in that family burns in hell forever
Wow. What a great read. For anyone who thought it might be too long - it's not. Well worth the time. 
Posting again as my first comment did not have enough words. 

That is such an amazing story and so well written. I thoroughly enjoyed it and shared it on Facebook as i think others would love it. 
Really good article. Very sad
Finding this article was one of the most fulfilling reddit-experiences I have had in a while. 
Amazing story.  Great post.
At some point, he wasn't young anymore. He was already in his 30s when he took Lola under his care. I can't help but think he could have and should have done it much earlier. Unfortunate that his older siblings didn't care enough. More unfortunate is I think most people would have done the same.
>"typical American kid"

With all due respect, go fuck yourself.
Jesus Christ, dudes.
Well, that was disgusting. I can't believe someone was willing to write a piece like that. I'm grateful for the insight that slave owning scum has provided. I'd also like to add I wouldn't piss on that family if they were on fire.
Thank you OP. This is the type of story that 1st got me hooked on Reddit ... A story so strong that you have to read every word, start to finish in one sitting.  
I cried so hard!!!!
Wow, thank you so much for posting this. I came for the comments, went for a skim, and settles right into that amazing article. 
I very rarely read autobiographies, but this was truly captivating. What a tragic story of people getting caught up in the American Dream myth. This was just so sad, I wanted to save her so much half way reading in. 
One of the best articles I've seen from Atlantic...stellar work
That was so touching it brought a few quick tears down my eyes, I couldn't have imagined I'd ever spend 30+ minutes on a single story on reddit, but it was just written so perfectly with such great detail R.I.P Lola I'm glad she was looked after in her latest years and will be missed by so many, thank you for posting this.
Beautiful story, saw on my friend's FB feed and immediately resonated with it. 

Jesus, I read half of that, couldn't continue, cried, read the other half, cried again. I'm an atheist but I'm going to say a prayer for Lola.
Such an Incredibly moving piece. For someone who has a hard time feeling sometimes this piece moved me to tears on multiple occasions.
Her name was Eudocia Tomas Pulido. Found this interesting. http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/lola-pulido-lived-life-of-devotion-to-family/
This story hits home for me. I had a Filipino maid growing up. She took care of me and my sister. She did everything in the household. She overstayed her visa and worked for us. We definitely treated her better than the family in the story. We paid her and we let her talk to her family. However, she was not free. Our family and her finally decided she needs to go back since she is having some mental break down. My mom self reported her to the police and they cried hugging together when she was being deported. (this was not in US) 

It makes me sad that people are Lola still exist in this world. They are the real angels in this world and I can't thank people like her for doing those thankless jobs. 

Thank Marisa. I miss you and hope you are doing well back in the Philippines. 
As a Singaporean who lived in Indonesia on and off from 1980s onward, unlike others I didn't tear up, because these stories aren't rare through out non-Communist South East Asia 20-30 years ago.  In some ways its worse than slavery, at least slaves have a chance to breed and interact with their fellow slaves, Lola didn't have such an opportunity. 

Lola story strikes me as odd for one reason.  She entered service at 18, which by standards even today she is old, by standards of the time she would be ancient.  Most maids enter service much younger, some as young as 10-11, most enter after they finish elementary or junior high, where they are much more vulnerable. 18 year old women aren't as docile / malleable.  Given that people in those days aren't sure about their age, I just have a strong feeling she isn't as old as she said she is.  

As someone who actually lives in South East Asia, the family's actions are deplorable, but very much product of the times. Such incidents happened in Indonesia as recently as 20-30 years ago, people would take young females who were distant relatives often only 12-13 years old to work for them often for no pay. This was in fact prevalent among the local nobility in Indonesia and even after the 1949, when noble families were stripped of their titles. In both cases its not defensible, no matter how much you cultural spin you put on it. The revolutions in much of South East Asia weren't just to throw off the Western colonizer, but to dismantle feudalism as well. 

The parents had a choice after her Visa expired, it was to send her back to the Philippines with some money, whether Lola wanted it or not. I think what the parents were doing wasn't just illegal/inhumane but irresponsible, if the police had stopped Lola checked her papers, they all would have been screwed. 
I hope the entire family, especially the author, are all burning in Hell.

What Lola's relatives can say about this news.  https://www.facebook.com/rapplerdotcom/videos/1619006638120113/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED

Fucking hell what a punch to the gut this article was. I wasn't prepared for just how sad this story got by the end.

Nonetheless, if there's any take away from this its that slavery is truly terrible on an absolute scale and that it hasn't yet been swallowed up by history. We need to end it, both here and abroad no matter the cost.
I was shocked to learn that Lola's story took place in the same small town of Salem, Oregon which is also where the author attended high school. And then I was saddened to learn that the author, Alex Tizon, died this year at only 57. https://www.dailyemerald.com/2017/03/24/pulitzer-prize-winning-school-journalism-professor-alex-tizon-dies/
 
I was about to go to sleep... I've been hunched over my phone with my legs hanging off my bed. I Got sucked in and couldnt stop reading... 
Man, this got to me. Been a while since writing really moved me. Amazing journalism, but the emotion this conveyed from guilt, regret, pain, anger, love, is just something to marvel at. Simply beautiful. Such a pity the writer had to die so soon.

Support for Biden Is An Irresponsible Gamble With Our Future

Republicans reading these comments probably have a boner. Acting like primary opponents are all cartoonish villains is silly and counterproductive. Whoever is the primary winner will need support from the entire base.

A popular candidate is crucial to the down ticket. The presidency is crucial to the judiciary. We're close to looking at a nation with 2 out of every 3 judges being not only conservatives, but chosen more for their strict ideology than their merit. And we're talking about generations before that can change. Think about that. We'll be in 2030 having all our laws decided by people who have a value system more at home in 1980.

If you don't like Citizens United, or don't like the way corporations can weasel out of any environmental lawsuit, or hate how workers get fucked in every legal dispute, or think minorities should be able to vote just as easily as white people, or gerrymandering should be dismantled, or abortions should be legal, or think homosexuals should have equal rights...conservative courts crippled Obamacare and they'll cripple the next plan too, they directly gave us GWB, they've voted for gutting fair voter protections...when grossly partisan and radicalized the judiciary rules the whole system. The only thing stopping it is balance and self-restraint and we're rapidly losing both.

So please, if you want care at all about any of those issues, don't do the work of right wing trolls for them.
Biden's not my first choice, but I'm definitely voting for whoever is opposite Trump.
Remember when reddit had a big boner for Biden and his memes
Yea, but a rabid sloth would be better than Trump.

Joe Biden to rich donors: "Nothing would fundamentally change" if he's elected
Holy shit, I can’t wait to see Reddit melt down when he wins the nomination.
A detailed look at the many negative aspects of Joe Biden's candidacy. The article makes the case that Biden is the candidate most vulnerable to Trump's style of campaigning, and that his presidency if he did win would pave the path for something worse than Trump.

I love Nathan Robinson.
So is not supporting Biden if he makes it past the primaries.
The thought of Trump getting another term makes me sick. Bring on anyone who can beat him. I don't care who it is.
[removed]
I don’t love Biden, but this tactic is getting old. Taking direct conversational quotes and even adding filler, um’s and reiterated words, makes someone seem really dumb on paper, but what he said makes sense whether or not it’s a good idea it makes sense. Who here talks as if they are giving a well written speech 24/7?
If Bernie can't defeat Biden that's his own fault for not doing anything to appeal to moderates.
He's completely fucking senile
Get whatever hate and complaints out of your system now so you can support the nominee no matter who they are.  Because Trump is fucking crazy, dishonest,  dumb, evil, and so much more.  And his voters don't care.
[deleted]
Bernie bros learned nothing from 2016 or just don’t give a shit.
As a centrist that tries to look at both sides as objectively as possible, it’s so frustrating (and increasingly predictable) to watch how the left continually eats itself. 

You have a clear front-runner that gets a ton of bad press from half of their own followers. If you want to beat Trump (which I’m totally for) they really have to stop tearing down their own house. It’s so short-sighted.

Yes, you may get a more middle-of-the-road candidate, but as long as he has the best chance to win, you rally around him. That may not be everything you want, but it’s progress. You have to start somewhere.
Democrats love to rip down the front runner in their party.  It makes us cool to like the underground, deep cuts like a Beta Band record circa 1999.  It is so uncool to like Biden.  

He wants us to have a public option for health care, which 10 years ago was progressive.  Meanwhile Republicans and Trump have been trying to destroy The ACA since day 1 and they love to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, money for education, climate change, infrastructure etc.  Meanwhile, you want to rip down Biden.  He supported marriage equality before Obama, but cool Democrats never remember that about him.  He is dyed in the wool Democrat, not the enemy. 

Howard Dean was the 2004 version of Warren/Sanders and leading in the polls.  He was brought down by a scream he made while trying to fire people up.  Kerry was the nominee and people never got behind him.  As soon as the democratic nominee are uncool or mainstream, Democrats can no longer support them.

Finally, it doesn’t matter how many plans Warren or Sanders have, if they can’t win some Republican votes in the Senate, most of their policies are sunk because of the filibuster.  So I get it, you want free Medicare and college for all, but you still need to compromise with Republicans (who will do absolutely no favors for Dems) and/or raise taxes on someone to make these plans work.  Biden has been in the Senate forever and he knows how to rally votes with the best of them.  He will be a very good president because he is much savvier than most recognize.
Jesus, Trump's gonna win again isn't he? 

Already there's so much infighting and intense vitriol here among people who are supposedly on the same team. And of course reddit thinks the demographic on reddit is super representative all of the US, so if anyone except Bernie or Warren gets the nom it's all a complete fraud and they have every excuse to not vote in protest, even if that helps Trump.

I hope to god it's not Biden too, but fact is, he's ahead in every poll for a reason (though dropping). Across all voters, he has name recognition and appeals to moderates/centrists (just because they're not on reddit en masse doesn't mean they don't exist), and he could very well win the nomination. And if you genuinely think Trump is bad for the US/World, there's no excuse to not vote.

Stop being childish. As if we're the only generation that ever had to vote for the lessor of two evils before. Politics is not a everything-my-way-or-I-quit kind of game. That attitude is putting children in "detention" centers and destroying our chance to combat climate change.

Or continue to think the same as before: "Hillary is just as bad as Trump", right? Except concerning issues of LGBT, net neutrality, climate change, healthcare, immigration, renewables, environment, abortion, gun control, having the formal respect of our allies, not being racist.. Of which she not just had stated positions but actual recorded and verifiable history as senator and sec. of state. But those are completely unimportant issues, right? So exactly the same because she's slightly hawkish and too friendly with Wall St.
Even when the GOP controlled the presidency & congress the only thing they managed to pass was a tax bill.  If Bernie is elected, even if the Dems control Congress his ideas are too far left to pass.  So, either he'll have to move more to the middle or the Dem president will have to be more moderate, like Biden, in the first place.  Personally, I prefer Harris or Warren to either of these guys.  But I know all the idiots that wouldn't vote for Hillary because she was a woman will vote for Biden.
Support for Bernie is an irresponsible gamble with our future
Is it really reasonable that a hard left leaning democrat will win? Biden seems like a great option because he can take some votes from conservatives who otherwise would have voted for trump and certainly would not vote for Warren.
I 'like' Joe but I have to remind myself that it is in the lens of him with Obama. He hasn't come out on top for me as a standalone candidate, however.
Tulsi Gabbard deserves more support. She's a veteran and has logical ideas.
While that's obvious i have no faith in the people who can vote without any obstructions to do the right and reasonable options other than biden. Overall this will be a test to see how much they really care for change.
I wish we could go back to the days of Socrates. A time when no one wanted to be a politician because they knew they would be hated by the public. It was matter of volunteering as tribute.

I've been consoling myself thinking maybe the only readon he's winning in the polls is because only people in their forties and up actually do polls.
tbh i will vote for anyone who legalized cannabis and expunges records
I don't pay attention to politics enough, I know I should. My 2 cents are, we just need some more "young" people in office and political positions.
For 10 years the Democrat party has claimed the ACA was/is a huge success. Now Bernie is out here telling the truth; that the healthcare system is broken and getting worse. Do you really believe that the Party establishment is going to agree with Bernie and admit that the biggest piece of legislation that they've passed in 50 years didn't solve anything? That their most favorite politician's only signature accomplishment was a failure? Not a chance. It's Biden all the way to the nomination.
The only thing bullshit like this will accomplish is solidify his support. Looking forward to casting my Biden vote in SC.
He was the architect of mass incarceration, known as the "Senator from Mastercard," and personally ran the hearings that were designed to build the case for the Iraq War.

He's also serially dishonest. We don't need this guy.
If Biden wins we get our "literal Hitler" in 2028. Bet on it. Look at the pattern of shifts in the past 50 years. It gets progressively worse. Republicans keep pushing their boundaries with each president they get in. Democrats look the other way. Then the next Republicans ups the ante even further. Etc.
Sure. Though I'm not an "I told you so" kind of guy I'll add to your misery if you really want me to.

Who cares? Vote blue no matter who!
Any democrat is going to win. The question is how the democrats can capture the senate...so politics becomes meaningful again because new laws can be passed. To do that we need a REALLY HIGH  turnout - to even higher levels than it will be anyway. This only happens by bringing out disillusioned people that normally don’t vote....by putting somebody interesting on the ticket like Warren, Buttegieg, or Beto...
David Brooks : I miss Barack Obama. I disagreed with many of his decisions but Obama had basic integrity and humanity. He had elegance. He had respect for people working for him. He avoided despair, cynism or fear. He had self-control under extreme pressure. I really miss him

I'm old enough to remember when Brooks got all pissy because Michelle Obama wore a sleeveless gown to a White House function.
"She needs to put 'Thunder' and 'Lightning' away."
I think we're still far from understanding the Trump phenomenon.
February 9th, 2016.

Poor man, if he only knew what was to come...
And yet, were David Brooks to go away, I would miss him not.

> That prediction didn’t quite pan out. Yes, the Iraq war ended up being a disaster, but contrary to Brooks’ assurance, the “clear judgments” about who was right and who was wrong about Iraq are still pending, as evidenced by the fact that so many people who got it so terribly wrong haven’t faced any real consequences.

Here to confirm that people who liked Obama miss him too
Opinion pieces are truereddit now?
I agree with some of what he is saying … but his repeated attacks on Bernie Sanders are off the mark in my opinion. Sanders knows that some of his ideas "wouldn't pass" in Congress—but has more of a "if you shoot for the moon you'll land among the stars" approach.
No shit - it is funny how this guy is publicly wrong on every topic for 20 straight years and they still pay him to write columns. He should be a parking lot attendant. 
If you agree with this and miss Obama, the new David Letterman on Netflix is pretty good. It also contradicts this authors (and many others) assertions of aloofness.

Hot take: bombing innocent Middle Eastern citizens does not show basic humanity. 
Why does everybody have to add the "I disagree with him, but" every they make a positive comment about Obama?  Just make your statement, you don't have to make it backhanded.
Barrack Obama was a (half)black man who couldn't make a misstep without being figuratively lynched.
A ‘sensible conservative’ is someone who occasionally comes to the correct conclusion via completely nonsensical means while taking potshots at his would-be allies in the process.
Clearly the public doesn't care about having a witty president who is eloquent and Kennedyesque. They wouldn't mind being ruled by a despot who promises economic growth and security.  That's the lesson of Trump. 
Oh please. Bush set the bar so damn low that someone who could act like a normal adult on camera for more than one minute comes off as a majestic statesman. Obama was dignified, but I would absolutely not ascribe basic integrity and humanity to him. In fact quite the opposite. What kind of sociopath does it take to keep pushing the drone wars, to keep punishing whistleblowers who alert unconstitutional behaviour by the authorities, who signs off on blank cheque wholesale spying on the American public and indeed the world, who kept pushing weapons into the hands of monsters to destabilise the middle east for a decade? The list goes on.

I would rather the US president is a grotesque maniac who you can openly despise and revile, because that is what the US government is. That is how the people outside of the US see the US - as a grotesque, disgusting monster that murders and abuses people around the world and still has the gall to lecture us about values and politics. In that sense I welcome Trump, because maybe now you, the American public, get some of the shit thrown back at you that the rest of the world had to endure for decades. And if you don't like that then how about you elect someone who isn't a blathering retard and an obvious front for some behind the scenes power broker who actually runs the show?
I do not accept that.

The outward facade, maybe.

He continued torture. He kept Gitmo open. He legalized bulk surveillance and continued wars. He allowed Wall Street to go unpunished and continue to gut the American middle class.

His crowning achievement is Obamacare. And that only passed by allowing insurance conpanies to continue lining pockets.

The last morally good person we had as a President was Jimmy Carter.

Edit: He absolutely could have closed Gitmo. He didn't. He allowed it to be an argument and worrying about polls in a state that might get some prisoners transferred instead of just closing the damn thing.
Obama cared about people, Trump will steal your pension and abuse your daughter
I wish David Brooks would go away so we could miss him, too.
We all miss him. I’m no fan boy and had many issues with him, especially his handling of journalists, FOI requests, the drone program, Obamacare, I could go on. 

But he is a supremely decent person who is thoughtful and cares about the people in the country he ran. He appealed to the aspirations and good in people. 

All that is gone now. 
Because of all of those things, Donald Trump was elected.
What a disingenuous jerk he is! He writes about these rightwing fascist nut-jobs like they are legit public servants, and NOW he misses Obama? What an asshat!
Strangely I don't miss David Brooks. 
He gets it wrong with Sanders, though. The guy's been working with both sides of the aisle to great effect for decades.
Hell... at this point I miss George W. Bush.

> We have problems, but they are less serious than those faced by just about any other nation on earth.

I generally agree with the author, but that kinda statement, it just always has to be in there doesn't it? American exceptionalism I mean. I think it's dangerous. It makes Americans blind to real improvements that have been achieved elsewhere. "Oh, that wouldn't work in *America* because [huge/car culture/diversity blah blah blah]". Stop this illusion. You have very serious problems in your country and the sooner you wake up the more fixable they are (and personally I think time at least for securing the climate is almost running out).
I have a feeling that Obama will be the last normal president.
Brooks is a complete phony.  First, he's not a conservative in any real sense and second, he absolutely LOOOOOOOOVED Obama while he was president.  It's not like Brooks is suddenly pining for days in the past that look great compared to now.  

Brooks is basically the NY Time's version of a conservative who's entire purpose is to tut tut actual conservatives that they're doing it wrong. 
Can I get a hallelujah to that?

Consider the most recent four Presidents.  Obama and Clinton versus Junior and Trump lol.

The US is in a state of regulatory capture by Corps(e), Supreme Court Justices and lobbyists.  This is unlikely to end well.
David Brooks is a blithering twat and his dickless approach to reactionary politics is as much to blame as anything else.
Obama and most previous presidents, even Bush, all meant well. You might disagree with their policies. But they meant well, wanted to do good for the country. Trump could care less. It's all about him. Screw everyone else.
> Obama had basic integrity and humanity. He had elegance.

Don't forget that wicked sense of humour! I bet he winked at his Nobel Peace Prize medal every time he signed the weekly kill list.
Taglines like the title of this article are a significant part of what led to trump. I highly prefer Obama but I also think this sentiment is a huge stretch from the reality of him as a president. Obama signed off on the indefinite detention of american citizens backed out on closing Guantanamo Bay without sufficient explanation and most importantly *drone striked innocent people consistently throughout his entire presidency*.    
     
People who were polite, friendly, and professional while still doing terrible things and falling through on promises were a huge contribution to peoples false hope that someone like Trump would do better. America rubberbanded hard from something that had been letting them down and because things are even worse now people are pretending it used to be good. That is another rubberband effect and the fact is that despite Trump being the farthest thing from a solution, we still need something new, in a politician or more likely a change in our system. 
Yeah, I miss massively increasing domestic spying and drone strikes!  I miss continued policies of exploitation and genocide to the third world.  He looked stately while persecuting whistleblowers and defending corporations, I miss that!

Not that the current one is any better, but don't idealize the past.

> Obama’s basic approach is to promote his values as much as he can within the limits of the situation. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, has been so blinded by his values that the reality of the situation does not seem to penetrate his mind.

This x 10000
[All the same, being the commander-in-chief of a global empire does necessarily entail getting one's hands dirty...](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2017/01/11/obama-the-war-criminal-butcherer-of-women-and-children/)  Obama just happened to make it look so good!
So all he misses was when we were polite imperialists? President Obama expanded the surveillance state as well as the drone war, and the ACA was a poor compromise based on a republican plan that handed our Healthcare even more solidly to the private insurance industry.
Obama had great PR. That's it. He was just in bed with wallstreet as trump is. You really think those bankers paid him $400,000 to give a speech?


Obviously better than trump, but let inform ourselves a bit more before we praise a politician. lets get real
http://dailysignal.com/2016/10/24/9-controversies-obama-didnt-mention-when-he-denied-any-major-scandals/

0bama had tons of scandals. He also had the MSM on her s side for his entire term.
Op-Eds are the worst form of pseudo journalism. It's not news yet people often treat it like news. This is just pandering to US democrats. 'Remember how great Obama was?'

Compared to Trump, anything is better.

Maybe that's intentional.

I'm honestly starting to think that democracy in the US is bullshit and that US elections are nothing but smoke & mirrors.

Media in the US is all corporate. Since the 90s, the major media conglomerates have turned into massive powerhouse companies that have an insane amount of influence.

Candidates for the presidency are chosen in the primaries.

When Ron Paul ran for the Republicans, they sabotaged him and made him lose. His own party screwed him over. Same goes with the media. They framed him as a racist, crazy person and basically showed that US media is really good at character assassination.

When Bernie Sanders lost to Hilary Clinton in the last election, the Democrat party colluded with Clinton to screw over Sanders who seemed like the people's choice candidate.

Let me reiterate this fact: Hilary Clinton colluded with the Democrats to undermine Bernie Sanders as the potentially rightful candidate.

Clinton was given the nomination and lost to Trump.

When it came out that the Democrats worked with Clinton, the press made up the story to blame Russia for Clinton losing, and since then, this whole time with Trump in office, has been about Russia.

Trump is a glorified wrestling villain. The media loves him. All the media talks about is how Trump is bad and no one gives a shit about anything else going on.

I honestly think the US is rigged to put in 'chosen' candidates. Clinton & Trump were picked like new cast members. They're puppet actors working for the corporate types that want to make sure no outsiders come in to 'rock the boat'.

Obama was a classy guy but he was full of shit. He got in claiming to be anti-war but wasn't. Under him, drone bombings got worse. Under Trump, they're even worse.

Obamacare wasn't close to real universal health care. By not cutting out the for profit insurance companies, it just meant the US public were forced to pay these middlemen douchebags a lot of money.

I liked Obama's image but he was still just another puppet.

You guys in the US need a 3rd party. This 2 party thing isn't working. Both sides are run by bad people.
I miss the drone strikes and JSOC raids and destabilisation of nations.

I get that that's still going on. But at least under Obama they were denied or rationalised or mitigated.
Librarian lives frugally entire life to donate a fortune to university library where he worked, university spends money on new football scoreboard 'in his honor'. UNH's tuition is among the highest in the state, thanks in large part to the enormous spending it diverts to the campus football team

how UNH is trying to justify spending a good chunk of a frugal librarian's doantion on football.

>UNH clearly believes its future is football, and so when the Morin made his rare unrestricted gift of $4m (which he had saved by eating microwave meals, never going out, rarely buying new clothes, and restricting his hobbies to activities he could do for free) to the university, they immediately earmarked $1m to buy a giant scoreboard for the stadium.

>But according to internal documents obtained under public records requests, the university understood that this wouldn't play well, so they came up with an elaborate plan to explain how this was honoring Morin's intentions because he sometimes watched football games on TV while he was dying of colon cancer. In reality, Morin spent his last days assuring his visiting co-workers that they wouldn't have to worry about funding for his beloved library.


Why the hell did the guy make an unrestricted gift?
This is a large part of why I, a red-blooded American male, really don't like football. My high school library had ratty old books and partial hours, but the football team had new uniforms every year / as needed, their own buses, a weight room we wouldn't have had unless the football team existed, a stadium (small town stadium, but still) and dedicated coaches who really didn't do anything else other than the bare minimum to be considered 'educators.'

This is complete bullshit and not only a slap in the face of this man, but every other employee *and student* of that school.

This is the university equivalent of "I'm not gonna spend my inheritance on a degree, I'm gonna buy a guitar and be a rock star!"
[Looks like this is not recent.](http://www.businessinsider.com/university-new-hampshire-football-stadium-scoreboard-librarian-donated-million-dollar-estate-2016-9)

Interesting he didn't donate it directly to the University Library.

College sports, the bane of all colleges. They exist only to give the dismal and lumpy a reason to care about college. This is a sad but perfect illustration of everything wrong with college sports, right down to the penny-pulling distraction and subversion they create when it comes to real educational pursuits. 
In my opinion, since the donation was unrestricted, the biggest mistake wasn't in spending $1M on the scoreboard but spending so little on the library. If they'd spent the other $3M on the library and cut the crap about the man's football interest, I think the whole thing would have blown over quickly.
What is it with Universities and Football? It's such a stupid sport and they seem to dump endless amounts of money into it, for what exactly?
Just an FYI, when you donate money to a university, you can tell them how you want your money spent and they are legally obligated to use it where you told them. They can get in a huge amount of trouble if they dont. So if your a librarian, dont give 4 million to the university's general fund.
In the future please link the original article instead of an article by a separate publication cribbing the original.

Original article: https://deadspin.com/how-unh-turned-a-quiet-benefactor-into-a-football-marke-1819064622
Humans have no shame. That's why you make sure tgubysluiqe1 this are covered legally.
I did research at the UNH library once. One of the letters on the entrance sign of their archive had been stolen, apparently by a fraternity. Their campus newspaper described issues with drunk students vomiting and even defecating in the hallways of the dorms. Although I am certain it has some faculty and students who value education, it overall struck me as a holding pen for middle class kids who want to put off getting a job, not for students who value learning.
They directed only 100k of his 4million dollar grant to his library. His word md from his dying bed were "you'll never have to worry about funding for the library again." What fucking scumbags dishonored this gentle soul's dying wishes?
I hate football/sports culture 
God.  Damn.  It.

This is shameful.  When people ask if I follow football, I say no.  I don't give a damn about the Packers.  Football exists to take money from academic endeavors.
Take football out of public schools and now universities. It’s not for learning. 
That is truly horrible. universities are about knowledge- not sport. No wonder so many Americans are totally ignorant- many do not value education.
Two things to keep in mind-

1) If you make a donation and want it to go to something specific, you earmark that shit. Seriously, you can't trust people with large sums of money, not even your best friend. You give money to someone with an intended purpose, make damn sure you do it in a way that it can't be used for anything else. This guy knew how to be frugal, but he had no idea how to be a wealthy donor, which is too bad. 

2) Although it seems strange the UNH is all-in on football considering their lack of football success history, a million dollars to help raise the prestige of your team can pay off hugely for these schools. If UNH can schedule even just one or two out of conference games with big names, [making between $500,000-750,000 is per game is common](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/aemxn4/pay-for-flay-why-fbs-fcs-beatdowns-will-never-go-away). A small school can schedule a big school in September, get their asses kicked, and [laugh all the way to the bank.](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/09/13/how-prairie-view-essentially-got-paid-450000-lose-/) 

There is a whole lot of /r/IHateSportsball going on in this thread. 
Sports must be removed from academics. I am sick of this shit. 
/r/titlegore
What was that librarian thinking? I don't know how someone could work for a university and think that anything BUT this would happen.   
  
The sad truth is that our universities are no longer institutions of learning. They're professional sports franchises with glorified strip malls attached to them, driven by money. Even public universities.   
   
I'm a recent graduate. Every single year, my tuition went up by the maximum amount that the school was allowed to raise it under state law. Every year, my class sizes got bigger. Every year, budgets were cut. Every year, my professors griped about lack of funds, lack of resources, lack of damn near everything. And every year, there was some ungodly spending on a project directly related to athletic programs.   
   
Whether you're a student or a donor, you ought to fucking know by now that the lion's share of every dollar you give to a university is going to go to sports and not education. 
Why is there no submission statement? 
These numbers are staggering. How does a librarian (frugal or not) accumulate $4m and what kind of scoreboard costs $1m?
This college sports is a uniquely american thing from what i've seen, no where else even comes close to the emphasis and resources put on that.
Wait a minute, can someone explain how a scoreboard costs a million dollars? 

I absolutely cannot stand collegiate sports. At the university I graduated from, football, and sports in general, was everything. Also, the athletic departments could take money from the academic departments if they were running short, but the academic departments could never take any of the athletic departments money if they were in need; nope, in that case, they would have to start firing professors and/or raise tuition again. Oh, I forgot, right before I graduated, they started renaming many of the major thoroughfares through the campus after their beloved sports "heroes". It was absolutely disgusting.
That is alarming, but unsusprising.

I'm afraid that football is becoming a money sink for most schools. On a handful of universities make money off of it.

I think that sports and education should be separate from each other. 
Just remember . . . whatever your legacy is and the documents covering it are, someone will wipe their ass with it to get their hands on the money or possessions contained within to do as they please.

There is no respect in this country for wills and trusts.
Man, this really bummed me the fuck out. 
The librarian is kind of a moron. He wasted his entire life to give money to corrupt assholes. He could have built his own library for 4 mm
Maybe the reason we're having a tough time with higher education in this country is because the people who run it are human garbage.
TLDR

librarian is dumb
It's a colossal waste of money but he didn't leave it to the library.

From the Deadspin (which should have been linked) :

>Mullen asked his client several times if he wanted to alert the university to what was coming or to specify any uses for his donation—some scholarships for the library’s student workers, say. Morin would go home and think about it, but in the end he always declined. “I think I’ll just leave it as it is,” he told Mullen.

He was asked multiple times what he wanted the money to go to, and decided to hand it in a lump sum to the university. I mean does it reflect the values of someone who died with a non working television while owning $4 million? No. Does it reflect his explicitly stated wishes? Yes.
That's ridiculous.  Horrible.
My biggest question is why people would donate to a state university (or, hell, any university) to begin with - your employer even more so! 

I can maybe understand (but still condemn) if you're Charles Kushner, but to UNH? Really?
Why not link the original article instead of linking somebody quoting the article. I feel like half the internet has turned into this.

jesus fucking christ. people donate to animal shelters not universities
Fuck universities who ALWAYS ducking cry poor to not only students, but staff. 
Why does he have a martyr complex?

He could have lived confortable and still donated 3 mill, thos story makes no sense.
That sucks.
Education is not valued in the United States by most people, an attitude that has spread even to those who run colleges.

Why didn't this go into a restricted fund?!
This is just heart breaking...
Seems wrong for a school to do this, but it’s not so cut and dry. You shouldn’t discount the value of *raising the athletic profile* of a school. Spending money on the football team at UNH helps to raise the overall stature of the school, and increases applications and enrollment:

https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/03/the-march-madness-application-bump/519846/

If you’re a small state school like UNH and want to join the ranks of large elite public research universities like Penn State, Michigan, Wisconsin, UC, etc, then having elite sports programs  is part of building such an institution. 
How could a man who spent his life in a library be so stupid? 
Can you really spare $4m on a lifetime of a librarian salary by just sparing on everything?
Emory is by no means a perfect school, but one of the things I loved about going there was the minimal focus on sports and lack of a football team entirely. 
He donated to the university, not the library. If he'd wanted the funds to be spent on the library, he could've specified that. He didn't.
fuck them all. 
As a UNH student, this really angered everyone on campus, especially because our football team is shit and deserves no attention

Also, there is some struggling buildings on campus, one of which legally doesnt pass fire code/ wasn't accessible  to people in wheelchairs until this semester. Soo... UNH can buy a score boardbut can't make a building safe.
Yeah, because the University of fucking New Hampshire is well known for its top notch football program. /s
Just playing devil's advocate here:

Most times, a school's biggest money-maker is the football team. They can make enough money from football ticket sales to support many other programs .

So it could be that investing this librarian's money in the football stadium is an investment which will turn it into even more money.
You know what will solve this problem? More free money for colleges! /s
I want to know how a librarian can save 4 million dollars by eating microwave food. I occasionally eat microwave food and I have about 4 million less in my account than that librarian had. Irony of all ironies: He probably got cancer from eating all that microwave food. Should have invested in a nutritionist 30 years ago.  
I mean the guy was kinda dumb, he could have easily locked down what the money was supposed to be used for. He didn't... So shit happens. 
Im sure the football program generates a profit. It's not like the school doesn't get returns on that cash. 
Mehh, he a dum dum fo dis 1 str8 up
The Dutch are developing a machine that rewards crows with food for picking up and throwing away cigarette butts.

Hey a guy claimed to do this a few years ago in a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_on_the_intelligence_of_crows), turns out it never actually worked.  Let's see if this one works.
I think the endgame will be the birds taking cigarettes directly from people's mouths.

I'm ok with that.
Put that butt recepticle where smokers congregate and perhaps they'll choose to get the free peanuts themselves. Then the Dutch will have developed a machine that rewards smokers with food for throwing away cigarette butts. 
Can’t we train humans not to litter somehow? Maybe put human heads on lamp posts with a sign that says “Joe littered. Don’t be like Joe.”
###Submission statement 

The machine can be put anywhere and will, practically on its own, train crows to pick up and throw away cigarette butts. The machine is still being developed and will soon be crowdfunded. Not yet certain if being exposed to so many cigarettes has a negative effect on the crows. Hopefully it doesn't, because this is too good of an idea. I am so attracted to any idea that creates a more symbiotic relationship between man and nature--this certainly does. 

Edit: Thanks for the Gold, anonymous kind person! Its greatly appreciated!
>It is equally important to ask, should we enslave crows to do our dirty work for us?

I don't see how this is enslavement. If the crows don't think it's a worthwhile deal, they'll just stop going to the machine, and do whatever they did before. 
"Crow beak cancer epidemic stops humans from littering cigarette butts"
If you've ever been to Amsterdam and seen the sheer volume of cigarette butts wedged between the sidewalk bricks, you know getting crows to clean that up would be a monumental achievement.
The crows will outsmart and cheat the machine just for kicks.
> “When we tell people about this project, and they realize how large the problem is, it changes their behavior.”

That's so charmingly optimistic. More likely people will say "Oh, well, fuckit, birds will pick up my trash, so who cares?" and toss even more.
This would be great if they could train them to do it with styrofoam or grocery bags instead. I used to clean up stormwater ponds for a living, guess what we never ever found? The only cigarette butts I ever picked up were those that I had smoked the day before. We found needles, crack pipes, but nothing compares to the amount of bottles, cans, and grocery bags we found.

I think i read somewhere cigarette butts take less than a month to disintegrate, they're just plant cellulose. I wouldn't be surprised if it was less than that. I do understand using them to clean up butts on city streets I guess, if people really consider them that much of an eyesore
Amazing, easier to train crows than humans. Stupid fucking humans. 
Where's /u/unidan when we need him?!?!
This talk from 2008 mentions experiments that perhaps inspired this. 

https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_on_the_intelligence_of_crows/up-next
This is so messed up manipulating innocent crows to wipe the ass of stupid human. 
I always thought that adding a CRV of 5 cents per cigarette butt should be the way to go.  Several US states do that with aluminum cans and they all get picked up.  Plus it's either (altruistically) a way to get smokers to pay a tax that ends up going to the homeless/poor people or (pessimistically) a way to train people to pick up their cigarette butts to avoid attracting the homeless.  It works for cans; why wouldn't it work for cigarette butts?
I wonder if I could train crows to steal money from people and bring it to me for peanuts or something.
We couldn't train humans, so we must resort to a superior intellectual force, the bird. 
Won’t this train people to throw cigarette butts on the ground to look at the cute crows picking them up and throwing them away?
What, now it's the fucking crow's responsibility to clean up our trash for us? 

Imagine the weird, dystopian future where the last remaining animals have been trained to follow humans and clean up their trash.
How long until the crows figure out they can increase the supply of cigarette butts by removing anti-littering and "no smoking" signs? 
I liked where he placed porn on the graph there. 

I guess it is brilliant, the biggest cash grab ever, using the most primal feature of every one on the planet. 
Oh dope. These need to be everywhere. 
I thought of this years ago. 
Why not just make a machine that picks up and throws away cigarette butts?
I totally thought that said "cows" not "crows." Crows makes much more sense.
As other have mentioned there may be some unintended consequences. 

Conditioning
https://xkcd.com/1156/

Automod warned me using an xkcd comic as an example.... wow the meta.
That's so awesome I almost wished I hadn't given up smoking. Crows are very cool, and there's something brattishly appealing about throwing butts on the floor to (indirectly) feed them. You could almost be visiting with them. Especially if they started hanging around smoking areas. 
Crows are more intelligent than smokers.
What were to happen if the Crows got addicted to the residual nicotine? 

Concepts like this are the future of the planet, for ourselves and the rest of the biosphere.  A way of engaging with other species that isn't one sided exploitation or the elimination of pests but a novel approach that's mutually beneficial.
Can the machine differentiate between cigarettes and anything else? If not, the crows will quickly find out that they can put anything in the machine to get food out.
that's a great way to get crows to start grabbing everybody's butts
10 years from now we will hear about crows addicted to cigarettes, and dying from lung cancer at accelerated rates. This will also have added effect of low birth weight eggs, giving us smaller crows. 
Why not a machine that rewards humans with food when throwing cigarette butts away? Oh yeah... crows are smarter. Never mind 
[deleted]
I love crows. 
Ah crows, not cows...
Yus. 
Very interesting
Damnit, why haven't we already thought of this. We're  smarter than Crows, right? ..right??
It's two Dutchies, not all of us or a government funded initiative. But I do look forward testing it out!

Edit: clarification. 
Until seagulls begin to develop mouth cancer...

Edit: because the Mods think you're to dense to grasp, they may be correct.
I hope they get cancer...I was at Wal-mart this morning to buy bread and milk for the coming snowpacolypse cyclone E.L.E. and a couple of crows were next to the spot where I parked eating refuse left in a flattened Hardees bag...I kindly inconvenienced myself by ambling across the seats so that I could get out of the passenger side of my Impala so as not to scare them during their meal since they were close to my driver side...after doing my shopping I come back to crow shit all over my Impala...I want those crows to pay for there treachery.
Trump filed for reelection in 2020 on Jan. 20th 2017. This means that he, acting as candidate instead of president, can receive large sums of money from citizens as "donations" and nonprofits such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood can not "campaign" against him without risk losing nonprofit status

Can someone do a ELI5 for non-US people, please? 
As much as I appreciate the content, I feel like the format of this article makes it inappropriate for this subreddit. It is a list of tweets. A heavily slanted list of tweets that starts out with "These fascists are evil to the core." 
Ugh. I thought I was going to get an article, not a list of tweets.
This is something that could easily go ignored in the chaos that is currently taking place. This is *not* normal. In fact, it's unheard of. In comparison, Obama filed for 2012 reelection in April, 2011. This is a step further in assuring that he has legal backing for the policies and practices he is introducing to the political landscape. The part about donation money makes it very easy for private citizens to "donate to the Trump campaign" in exchange for favours from the president.

Update: I can't seem to find a lot of substantial articles on this issue. It seems like this is starting to get attention only now. But here is [the filing from the FEC](http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg?_201701209041436569+0) and here are two, more articulate, articles:

- [Trump Files Early With FEC For 2020 Candidacy, Outmaneuvers Nonprofits](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-30/trump-files-early-fec-2020-candidacy-outmaneuvers-nonprofits)
- [Trump breaks precedent, files as candidate for re-election on first day](http://www.azfamily.com/story/34380443/trump-breaks-precedent-files-on-first-day-as-candidate-for-re-election)
This is just a screenshot of a bunch of Tweets.  This is not a "really great, instightful article."  This is Tweets.  Despite our President, this subreddit is better than that.  This should be posted in /r/politics, or some other short-attention-spanned sub.

Reported
> and nonprofits such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood can not "campaign" **against** him without risk losing nonprofit status

The same go for any non-profits campaigning **for** him. A non-profit cannot speak in favor or against a specific candidate. Its against the law, but the worst punishment is losing your non-profit status.

https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/the-restriction-of-political-campaign-intervention-by-section-501-c-3-tax-exempt-organizations

From the IRS:

> Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from **directly or indirectly** participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or **public statements of position** (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization **in favor of or in opposition to** any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity.

But no one actually gets in trouble for it, so they can probably do whatever they want. And it doesn't stop anyone who isn't a non-profit organization. And its mostly to prevent PACs from trying to classify as a non-profit instead of a PAC to avoid regulations.
While I'm not an expert, I think the piece about non-profit campaigning is not on point as the restrictions on lobbying activity don't have to do with whether a candidate has filed for reelection. 

501(c)(3) organizations - which can receive contributions that are tax-deductible to the donor - can never engage in political campaigning or engage in lobbying activities. 501(c)(4) organizations (which are also non-profit) can engage in political activities, but contributions to those organizations are NOT tax deductible. 

The "regular" ACLU is a 501(c)(4) as it is always engaged in political activity and lobbying. There is an ACLU Foundation that is a 501(c)(3) that supports litigation and public education (but no lobbying). See https://www.aclupa.org/abouttheaclu/aclu-vs-aclu-foundation/

For Planned Parenthood, the 'regular' organization is a 501(c)(3) and can receive tax deductible donations. There is also a Planned Parenthood Action Fund that engages in lobbying activity; donations to that organization are not tax deductible. 


Actually, the ACLU *can* criticize and campaign against him.  The ACLU consists of a lobbying organization and a tax-deductible foundation. Both file lawsuits,  but only the latter has to stay out of politics. When you donate to them,  they will ask you to choose where the money should go. 

Source: I just donated. 
If someone can fill me in with more details other than this tweetstorm article, that might help. This Washington Post article says the President isn't formally announcing his candidacy, just that his campaign is still required to report over $5000 of donations to the FEC. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2017/live-updates/politics/live-coverage-of-trumps-inauguration/president-trump-tells-the-fec-he-qualifies-as-a-candidate-for-2020/?utm_term=.d4b1ba6691f4
I call BS.  He doesn't stop being POTUS just because of this.  This makes things a bit trickier, from a formal legal standpoint, but I don't see how this should be a game-changer.

I'm seeing this as a left-wing version of the "OBAMA'S GONNA TAKE YER GUNS AND TURN YER KIDS GAY!!!" hyperbole that the far-right loved to panic about during Obama's first term.
The timestamp on that document says 17:11, which is after he was sworn into office that day. By that point, he was officially president.

Isn't that the critical distinction here, the question of whether or not he acted as candidate or president?
He and his ilk are masters of finding and exploiting loopholes, and he will admit this himself. Strategically, it's a genius move. It is an asshole move, but smart. He brags about exploiting loopholes and playing the game strategically.

http://www.azfamily.com/story/34380443/trump-breaks-precedent-files-on-first-day-as-candidate-for-re-election

I can't imagine what his response will be when journalists ask him the reason for this haste. I'm actually curious to see how he'd spin it.
Those groups can campaign *for* the other candidate though if they leave Donald's name out.  They could also just set up a superpac to circumvent these rules.

Trump is just following the law to a tee here.  You can call it unethical but we shouldn't be surprised that he's trying it.
It's how he's lived his whole life tho. Above everyone else. From employing Roy Cohn in his early days in real estate. To declaring bankruptcy, what? Six times!  To taking over the USFL and leaving the league to die out. Trump does what he wants, for Trump. There's no telling what he's really thinking or believes in because he's always been out for himself. It's very difficult to trust this motherfucker. He's a great con man that seems to only participate in the game when he can put the fix in first. 

You people are probably being taken for suckers. You're allowing him and his cadre of con artists to walk all over you. 
All you have to do is say this ad is targeting Trump the acting President and not Trump the candidate for 2020.

Fine print is what advertisers do best.
This has to be an incorrect reading of that statute. Surely the first amendment supercedes and non-profits can make any statements they want about the sitting president without regard to whether or not they've declared their re-election campaign. Do non-profits normally go silent during election season?

The man is making a spectacle of the law.
Fuck sakes it's a list of tweets. 
This makes me think that this man and his buddies are actually going to take the US for everything it's got and bail. He obviously doesn't give a shit, and he's doing everything so quickly.. idk. I never imagined this kind of thing could ever happen in a country like the US, it's just too bizarre, and frightening really. 
Trump being shady? Color me shocked.
I can't find anything substantial to back this up. Has this been cross checked and verified? Where can we go to do so?
Total shit article "/r/truereddit" lol what a joke. I'm fucking off
That is some very shrewd maneuvering. I feel that he is in his right to exploit this unsavory loophole, however I hope that he does enough unsavory things so that they will close the loophole so that none can do it again.
satan is real and he has bad hair!
I think the question we should all be asking is why it's even possible for ANYONE to file for the 2020 election yet.  That shouldn't be a thing and contributes to these long, drawn out, election cycles.

edited to amend: but yes, this is extremely concerning and I hate tweeticles.

Edit edit: Twitter and articles, not Twitter and testicles.
Doesn't that mean that any churches supporting him can also lose nonprofit status?
He isn't going to last through *this* term, so it will ultimately be irrelevant. 
Seriously, what're the odds you give Trump lasting as President until even 2020?
Reading just the headline made me sick to my stomach. Is this how dictatorships that are not military backed start?
He's such a crook.
Turn everything up to 11...
If this is such a good move why didn't anyone else do it before ?

Let me guess, that makes him smart ?
Is anyone going to someday tell Trump, "No, you can't do that"?

When is enough enough?
Fuck 
is anyone else reporting on this?

If this is true, it's smart on Trump's part.  Better change the law.
Wow he is really smart. He's going to effect lots of changes. Much more efficient than previous presidents. Also, is a series of tweets really an acceptable format for an article? WTF?
Whatever you may think of the man, he's a master at 4d speed chess. 
Such deep idiocy. 501(c)(3) orgs can write about Trump to the same extent they could. That he declared for office has nothing to do with it.

How on earth does anyone link to Daily Kos with a straight face and zero skepticism. 
That's because he's smart
I feel like the mainstream news should be aware of this action and it's implications. The American citizens should be told.
article no.3 on here that is not suitable for truereddit

mods, can anyone answer for this?
Smart man. 
I would give credence to this argument if you could point to once when this came up against an incumbent. We also have like no precedent of actually stripping 501(c)3 status for this. 

And yes I know Trump follows no norms. But what we have seen is he is not about using surgical precision to force out groups  like this tactic would be. He is all about the heavy blunt force that is indiscriminate towards specific actors through the judicial. The specific aim comes in mob justice. 
did he do something illegal? no? then who cares. if anyone else could have done it, but trump is the only one who figured it out, how smart are all the other politicians?

Times have changed: the Pope is now more scientifically literate than the US Senate.

To be fair, a lot of evangelicals really dislike Catholics. I grew up in a crazy pentecostal church and they made it a point to deride Catholicism whenever possible - even labeling it as a cult rather than a sect of Christianity.
> the Catholic Church had no problem with evolution or with the Big Bang theory of the origins of the universe.

They haven't for quite some time.
I'm on my mobile so have no way to prove this..  but..  Pope JohnPaul II said that there can be no faith without reason..  hence it's a Catholic's duty to try and understand the science of creation.  And the current Pope recently chastised a questioner by stating that God wasn't a wizard.     

(Disclaimer:  I'm Catholic - friendly, but not religious)
The general perception of the Catholic Church is way off apparently. I went to a Catholic high school (read: ex-Catholic) and was taught about evolution and global warming. There are a small amount of crazy right wingers in the Church that deny that stuff but the official position of the Church is that science and faith are compatible, science is our way of understanding God's creation. 
[deleted]
The pope does not have to convince Vatican City that burning oil and coal is actually good for the environment.  I doubt the problem is lack of scientific literacy.  It is corruption of the GOP to pass on the external costs of the oil and gas companies to the American people pure and simple.  They get their beaks wet with kickbacks and pass the cost onto the next generation.  I would never, ever call this current GOP conservative.  Conservatives care more about their kids future than next quarters profits.
[deleted]
The Catholic church has always been scientifically literate. It's the American brands of Christianity that went full retard with regards to science.
I wouldn't say times have changed. Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict Emeritus) is very well versed on science, with his theological essays encompassing Heisenberg, Einstein, Bohr and so on. 
The people in the US Senate who believe evoltion is a lie are likely to also believe the Pope is going to hell because he hasn't accepted Jesus into his heart.  
Well that's not quite true, some senators have some impressive degrees. 


They're simply in an office where campaign contributions (sic bribery) have major influence. 
My dead great uncle's dead dog is more scientifically literate than the U.S. Senate.
I wish these ignorant planet-destroying bastards would be given 200 more years to live. It's not their world they're wrecking; it's mine. I'd like to be able to see a sunset outdoors while breathing fresh, healthy air before I die. 
Yeah well the Pope doesn't need petro dollars to stay in office. It's not that they're scientifically illiterate, it's that they're bought and paid for.
When were senators ever scientifically more literate than the pope?
Yeah.

Head of oldest Christian religion: "Global warming is man-made and it needs to be stopped right now. Evolution and the big bang are real and we should stop giving people shit for believing in them."

Governing body of largest government in the world: "We can't be sure whether global warming even exists! We can't even be sure that God didn't put dinosaur bones into the soil so that we'd stop believing in Jesus! Maybe we all live in a bowl of soup!"

To be fair, the pope is elected by a group of elites, while the Senate is elected by a group of everyday Joes. This is why I roll my eyes every time people talk about increasing voter turnout. Do we really want an even dumber median voter?
actually the difference between the pope and the senate republicans isn't scientific literacy, it is the fact that the pope has not been bought off by corporate interest ........yet.
Submission statement: A story about one of the ironies of our time. The Vatican has become much more open about science and its ability to explain our world. At the same time, the United States Congress has turned against it.
This isn't news, people. The relationship between the Catholic Church and science did not end after Galileo.

Hell, it even explains it in the article you posted.

>[The Pope's] comment was widely interpreted as a radical departure for the Church. It wasn’t, as Kara Gordon, among others, has pointed out in compelling detail. The Church has, for decades, taken the position that faith and science need not be opposed to one another. As the Catechism states, “methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God.”

[Here's the essay in question.](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/10/pope-francis-evolution/382143/) Times have not changed.

[And before anyone mentions the Dark Ages...](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/good_history#wiki_the_medieval.2C_and_dark_ages)
Is this regular irony or the Alanis Morrisette stuff? Also - I love pope Francis so damn much. 
It seems to me that mostly protestants believe in this "10,000 year demons are real and God is magic" religion and it is somewhat amusing that a church which upon its founding mocked Catholics for being superstitious and clueless, have now reversed roles so completely.
You say that as if it is an achievement!  
  
My toe nail clippings from last summer are more scientific literate then the US Congress!
Wouldn't it be cool if the Catholic church tried to encourage the faithful to make their known interpretations from observations of Religeion and Science? That'll be the fucking day.
This isn't really a surprise, but at least a nice fact- science has been advanced by Jesuits for a very long time. 
Yes, that's nice. The Catholic church is friendlier towards 'nonbelievers', but let's not forget that this is because the church no longer has the power to do anything other than bend to the will of the law and the people, or become marginalised. Let's not forget when they *did* have this power and what they did with it even as early as a couple of hundred years ago. Let's not forget the Spanish inquisition or the witch hunts of the dark ages where you could have a woman burn to the stake on the shakiest suspicion that she may be dabbling in the dark arts. It would be very easy to see all the subscribers of /r/atheism put to death and anyone else on mere assumption that they do not worship the same god. 

No, the church is not being accommodating and open minded because it chooses to, it is doing it to survive and let's never forget that.
Are Republican Catholics towing the GOP Anti-Science line? Wait, are there Repub Catholics? 
Apparently yes, although the Episcopals are who I was thinking of. They're in communion with the English Anglican church anyway, so it's mostly an academic distinction in the context I mentioned it in.
To be fair, though, that's a pretty low standard.
This article is silly. The reason the pope accepts science and some of our senators don't are completely unrelated.

The Republicans' supposed piety is merely to drum up votes. Their scientific ignorance is just a cover that allows them to further the interests of their corporate/industrial donors.

Put these two tactics together, and you get a bunch of politicians who say God controls the climate so there's no point in weaning ourselves off coal or passing any kind of costly environmental legislation.

That, and those senators don't give a shit what the pope thinks.
We've come to a time when the Catholic church is the thinking mans religion.
I don't understand why people are congratulating the Catholic church for being slightly less ignorant and idiotic than they've been for their entire existence. The irony is actually that the Pope feels he has the credibility to acknowledge a scientific truth as "true", and people think that's anything less than insane.
The idea of throwing every single person out of the US gov't and starting over brand new sounds better every day.

Amy Goodman Is Facing Prison for Reporting on the Dakota Access Pipeline. That Should Scare Us All.

They can charge a journalist with trumped-up crimes all they want; it doesn't mean they'll stick in court and it certainly doesn't mean she'll ever see a day in jail. 

This seems like a case of a local prosecutor/county judge trying to flex their tiny political muscles which will almost certainly wind up blowing up in their collective faces.

Edit: It just came out that the riot charge was not authorized.
Scary article. The prosecutor's comments basically say the state should be able to decide who is a legit journalist and who is too biased to be considered a "real" journalist:

>The charge: riot, a misdemeanor punishable by prison time and a fine. (It should be noted that the original charge leveled against Goodman was not riot but criminal trespass, also a misdemeanor. However, just days days before Goodman was set to appear in court, the prosecutor, Ladd Erickson, switched up the charges because, he admitted in an email to Goodman’s lawyer, Tom Dickson, there were “legal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute.”)

>When asked to explain the grounds for arresting a working journalist, Erickson told the Grand Forks Herald that he did not, in fact, consider Goodman a journalist. “She’s a protester, basically,” Erickson told the newspaper. “Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions.” And in The Bismarck Tribune he later added, “I think she put together a piece to influence the world on her agenda, basically. That’s fine, but it doesn’t immunize her from the laws of her state.”
I always thought it was interesting that no matter which news station I listened to, they all reported on the exact same stories. 

I guess she chose to do a story that wasn't on the list.

Deia Schlosberg's story is related, if that's of interest:  
http://www.howtoletgomovie.com/ is a petition to have Deia's charges dropped.
Why is every top level comment in this thread so hostile to her (at time of commenting this)? It's very unusual. I never say this but honestly it seems like some serious astroturfing.
Now America is locking up journalists for reporting? Looks like we didn't need a Trump presidency after all, the individual states themselves are moving forward with their fascism.
This is something we all need to stand up and speak out against. This could set a precedent that could further damage the press' ability to keep our government and corporations transparent. To sit by idle knowing this is going on is far worse than anything Amy Goodman has done, you need to contact the prosecutor in this case, Ladd Ronald Erickson, and put pressure on him to drop these charges. This isn't a witch hunt, that accomplishes nothing. We need to show this man that the people are wholly against his actions. Please, email him: lrerickson@nd.gov 
Amy Goodman's a hero. If you've never watched Democracy Now I would encourage you to check it out.
As a non-American, I don't understand why this is not a First Amendment issue: this is a clear case of the state attempting to stifle her free speech. The prosecutor does not consider her a legitimate journalist (despite her credentials and experience), because of the content of her reports.

It's a bit baffling to me, but then America has been mostly for the last 15 years or so.
In a [closely related story](http://commondreams.org/news/2016/10/15/filmmaker-faces-45-years-prison-reporting-dakota-access-protests), an Emmy award winning filmmaker is facing *45 years* for reporting on the Dakota Access protests.

Clearly our rulers want to suppress journalists and influence their reporting on these type of stories. Creating some examples to intimidate *other reporters* is one of the bread-and-butter moves done by tyrannical government across the world.

> "If those in charge of our society - politicians, corporate executives, and owners of press and television - can dominate our ideas, they will be secure in their power. They will not need soldiers patrolling the streets. We will control ourselves." -- Historian Howard Zinn.
I don't think its a wise move to go back into the jurisdiction that's out for her hide.

She should stay in her home state and let them try to extradite her. Then she could at least be heard by an independent judge.
It's a misdemeanor. By definition, there is no possibility of time in prison, only jail.  Please don't muck up good journalism with click bait headlines that are not true.  



Most of the video is just her describing what she's seeing, even a objective mind can put good and bad tags on things, putting dogs on people to let them get bit is not good.
It doesn't scare me at all. There is barely any distinction of journalist in US law. Journalists can do what they do because any one of us can do what they do.

And because there is no special exemption for journalists they are also subject to the law. So journalists sometimes have to take legal risks for what they are reporting. And she did.

And none of this is scary at all. It's how it always has been. The system didn't fall apart before I don't expect it to fall apart now.

She will have her time in court and if she didn't do anything severe she won't end up on prison. And this isn't scary at all either. But if on the other hand she was part of a riotous mob, then she doesn't get a free pass because she also filmed the riot. And that isn't scary.
Well you see Americans are free. But corporations and their lackeys just got that pure distilled freedom know what I mean?
" *And what would Karen Silkwood say. If she was still alive? That when it comes to people's safety. Money wins out every time.* "
So, I'm not sure if i fully understand why the piece focuses so much on her being a journalist. It seems to me the author is implying she's only being arrested *because* she's a journalist, but doesn't outright say so because he doesn't have evidence that that's the case. Evidence like:

- any reason the prosecutor would want to aid the pipeline effort

- any evidence the prosecutor did in fact coordinate with people working on the pipeline

- any evidence she is being targeted for being a journalist (were warrants issued for other people there for example?)

> ﻿ When asked to explain the grounds for arresting a working journalist...

See, to me this question implies that the author thinks that Goodman should get special treatment for being a journalist. But from my perspective it's irrelevant whether or not she's a journalist. If he'd asked "why are you issuing a warrant for rioting for someone who didn't riot" i'd be on board. Or if he had evidence she was being targeted for being a journalist, i'd be on board too. But the article is weak on that front. It's also weak on explaining why she isn't guilty as charged by the D.A.

Glad WikiLeaks still exist. Journalism, AKA freedom of the press is constantly being threatened. Without such journalists, freedom on a fundamental level is denied.

Exactly how many people got charged with rioting during the same time?
She is a journalist who really does her job and also embodies the ethics a good journalist should have. She is a role model.

That was a horribly written, and very slanted article from a biased journalist that had a narrative to purport.  If you look at the words chosen to describe the protesters vs. the opposition, you'll find all the slant you need to discredit this reporting.

Secondly, when an activist (Goodman) who happens to also be a journalist goes to a site to work with the protesters in an affirmative manner, she shouldn't be surprised when they aren't treated as an unbiased journalist, but rather as one of the protesters.

This isn't journalism, it's a narrative piece.
The right and the left need to come together. IMMEDIATELY. The people who are running this shit are neither right nor left. 
I hope she cleans their clocks.
What about the freedom of press???
The first amendment doesn't require that journalists be exempt from the same laws that govern the rest of us. I can't trespass and neither can a journalist. That strikes me as perfectly cromulent.

Really? This qualifies as "great or insightful".

Can we as a community please not allow shit like this to be submitted? I say that because it all hinges on a highly debatable fact. "Amy Goodman is facing prison for reporting on the Dakota Access Pipeline" Or Maybe it's because she trespassed. I could be wrong. Maybe there are some sinister people out there that would arrest her for her journalism on the topic. Who the fuck knows? If it's the latter then it's a complete non-story. No amount of discussion is going to prove anything.

So what as a subreddit can we really pull from this submission? Only the fact that there is an arrest warrant out for Amy which may or may not have political motives. But that kind of submission is not quite that catchy or biased is it?

It's precisely the world liberals have created and Hillary Clinton will only ever make worse. The problem is that liberals don't even have the capacity to comprehend the counterproductive shit they do to trigger the very things they lament.
Um... Good. I can only assume she wanted to go to prison. "Public figure goes to prison because of civil disobedience" is a pretty standard ploy to gain media attention for a thing.
A vote for either Hillary or Trump is a wasted vote.

Both Hillary and Trump will do horrible things to the People and Gaia Mother Earth.
Neither is better than the other.

The Intercept : Indians just staged one of the largest workers strike in human history. Not a single american cable news network ran a segment on it. Even on Labor Day.

Organized labor news is a taboo subject in the US.
I live in Mumbai.  They should do it more often.  Traffic levels were actually tolerable during the taxi/rickshaw strike.
>TEN INDIAN TRADE UNIONS staged one of the largest strikes in human history on Friday

[From the cited source:](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/millions-indian-workers-strike-wages-160902131706206.html)

>Union officials said about 180 million workers, including state bank employees, school teachers, postal workers, miners and construction workers, were participating, **but the figure could not be independently verified.**

[From a BBC article:](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37253462)

>Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, told the BBC that more than 150 million workers in different industries were on strike. **But there has been no independent corroboration of the numbers given by the unions.**

Looking through the recent articles in the Times of India, [there are a few articles](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Strike) about unions going on strike. [This article cites a figure of 72,000 bankers going on strike.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/Workers-unions-on-strike-today/articleshow/53968207.cms) This one says [a few hundred sanitation workers](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Sanitation-workers-continue-strike/articleshow/53972588.cms) went on strike. 

[On /r/India, there is scant mention of massive strikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?q=strike&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

[This Reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-economy-strike-idUSKCN1151GB) says a million Indians went on strike. While still huge, that's nowhere close to 180 million.

Is there evidence that this is indeed one of the largest strikes in human history? 

This seems like extremely sloppy journalism on the part of The Intercept—anything for a cheap pot shot at the like, corrupt evil cable news who don't want Americans to know that they too can go on strike from their jobs, I guess. 

Labor strikes are extremely common across the world. But they're often not really newsworthy for a *general* American cable news audience unless the strike has some direct implication to the country, e.g., the people striking work for an American company.  
Indian here, thought will provide some pov on this topic.

While India has some really strong labour laws and really strong unions in the organised manufacturing sector and the govt sector, the strength of the unions ironically does not come from the labour, but from the fact that political parties run these unions.

Yes, you read it right, the biggest unions are run by the biggest political parties as another wing of their organisations.

What this means is, usually the union leaders are corrupt political leaders who have literally zero interest in the welfare of those who they are supposed to fight for. Strikes are mostly used as a tool to hurt other political opponents - this strike for instance, saw the second largest union (comprising some 40-50 mn workers) sit it out entirely because they are an arm of the ruling party.

Likewise, when the state of West Bengal was being run by communists and there was this private sector / worker conflict, the ruling Communist government set is thugs on...the striking workers, and the largest union in the country (and the state) simply sat out of the conflict.

While it seems as though unions are strong in India, go below the surface and you will see that union leadership is pretty much a corrupt selfserving political body.
Pretty terrible article, spends too much time outrage baiting not enough time reporting. 

Counter points:

1. The numbers are unverifiable as another user pointed out and almost certainly exaggerated as they come from the Unions who are staging the strike. 

2. The protests are largely due to India privatizing a notoriously inefficient and corrupt system (and I'm not sure why privatizing banks is necessarily a bad thing)

3. These protests while certainly newsworthy in India were not hugely disruptive as it was only public employees and geographically isolated, with the large cities like Delhi and Mumbai unaffected, meaning they aren't really international news. 
Indian here. In my part of the country, I didn't know there was a strike going on that day. For people in other countries, don't be led on by what the article claims what the emotion of the country was during the strike. 
Make the story the story. Trying to invoke outrage is shitty journalism.
FWIW, it was covered on EuroNews. So, it's definitely news worthy. I found it funny that even bank clerks joined the strike. Hard to imagine circumstances under which bank employees would strike in Europe.
The truth is, this happened in India. No one in America cares. I wish it was deeper than that, but between getting the kids ready for school, painting dorm rooms, summer's last BBQ, and enjoying the last warm rays of sun - not to mention watching our own shit show of an election... We don't have much attention span for whatever is going on elsewhere. Wish we did, but turns out we've got our own problems to sort through.
I am so glad this is happening and that I can find the news where I want it, not where THEY want me to look.

I guess my question is why would they? Is it going to dramatically effect Indian politics, or India-US relations?

There is always this sort of outrage when U.S. media doesn't cover stuff that happens in other countries... but it usually is stuff that well, won't effect many Americans.
Indian Here - These are lazy bastards preemptively demanding their rights to remain lazy bastards. Absolutely little sympathy from outside the lazy bastard community. 

These workers are from government run (into the ground) companies who essentially do nothing but because of Indian labour laws cannot be fired or suspended. They are anticipating privatisation and modernisation of labour laws and have decided to continue not working on this specific day.

Fuck 'em
But Hillary was having allergies, don't you understand how important that is?????????????????
Also the kashmir unrest?  Or is that the same thing?
I posted it on /r/worldnews that day, shocked that it wasn't already there. 200 upvotes, never made it to the front page. I'm glad someone's making noise about it now.
The MPAA is the motion picture Association. 

The producers (bosses of the film industry)  have a union. 



Yeah, it's in stark contrast to the normal wall to wall US coverage of current events in India.
why would us news cover it in the us? wouldnt that be for international news like AP?
I thought this was the pipeline thing, but i can understand not covering a union strike in india.
It's because we're assholes

Strikes are perceived as labor protests, so immediately people associate them with socialists or communists.

The US labor market is more dynamic and adaptive, so people don't care.
Indians from India, or Indians from the Americas? If the former, then I can kind of understand it. It's not really about the US and it's not whatever to us since it doesn't affect us much. Just odd that not a single network talked about it. If the latter, then... idk. It's not like American people try to acknowledge the fact that there's other dudes here living off the earth and all that 
no body gives a shit about them if they can't even figure out how to shit, drive or not rape properly.
