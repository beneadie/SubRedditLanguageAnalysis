ELI5:How after 5000 years of humanity surviving off of bread do we have so many people within the last decade who are entirely allergic to gluten?

We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.

Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.

On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know.

Tldr: shits complicated literally

edit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes.

People seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). 

Until relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning.

There is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone.

example: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going?

We do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a "fix" but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). 

tldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal "live a healthy lifestyle" advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don't ask for a quick fix and don't trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten.

edit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average "but gluten" person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac
I didnt mean to start a war.
There's a great Netflix 4-part documentary called Cooked that delves into this. The documentary series 4 parts were titled Earth, Air, Fire & Water, and it looked at an anthropological history of our diets and hunting/eating/cooking rituals. The Air episode was all about bread, and about how it has been a staple of our diets for so long.

Their postulate was that for the vast majority of people, gluten isn't the issue. Sure there are some people for whom the gluten is the problem, they just assume it is because modern bread doesn't agree with them because of the accelerated processes they use to make it. Or perhaps there used to be something in bread that prevented gluten from having such an adverse reaction.

It used to be that bread was fermented. The dough was a living, breathing colony. In more recent years, to speed up the bread making process, instead of allowing the natural bacteria in the water supply to thrive in the wheat and change it - they instead use "clean" additives, such as yeast.  Due to this, there are various nutrients that used to be in bread that aren't any more, so manufacturers have also added fortifications in also, to make up for those that were missing and actually have it be nutritious. 

TLDR: The bread we eat now isn't really anything like the bread our bodies evolved with. 
Just so we're clear: Allergy to gluten is a thing, but is different from celiac disease. Both are well-defined and different from gluten intolerance, which is less clear. 

The most common explanation for increased allergies is the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that aggressive modern hygiene removes the parasites and bacteria that help calibrate the immune system, leaving it more likely to react to harmless targets.

It's also been suggested that modern wheat could be more allergenic. The cross-breeding of new wheat strains in the 1960s, which allowed us to feed billions of people, could have selected for a protein variant that immune systems just don't like. Modern wheat processing has also been noted as a potential contributor.
A documentary was made for this exact question. It's called Cooked: Air.

From what I remember, it basically said that the way we make bread has changed drastically in the past 200 years (wonder bread, pure white flour, instant yeast, etc.) and that is what has caused people's "gluten allergies," not to be confused with Celiac's disease. It says that the original way to make bread, with homemade flour and long periods of fermentation, is better for people, and that most people aren't allergic to it.
Probably the same reason people are lactose intolerant. Unless milk could actually out right kill them, they stay in the gene pool. 

I've been drinking milk since I was a kid. Had bad cramps every day. But since every kid eats cereal for breakfast, milk being the culprit never dawned on me. Suddenly lactose-free milk comes out, I suddenly find that moo juice was the cause. I'm sure generations have suffered the same fate before me.
a little off topic : one thing I read a long time ago in nature before the anti-gluten trend we're seeing.  It was an article about fibre in our modern western diets.  and how we lack a lot of fibre in our diets and how the lack of fibre causes the lower intestines to not be healthy, getting swollen and enflamed.  When the lower intestines get to this stage, gluten can and has been shown to pass through the walls into the blood stream. At that point, once past the barrier,  problems occur.  It was a good read and I'm sure I'm paraphrasing it way wrong, but what I took from it, because our diets are bad in one way it's causing other problems to appear.  And you didn't have to have an allergy or Celiacs to see some of the problems appearing.   note: I think this is very different then the trend we are seeing today where everybody is afraid of the "glutens" 

I'd love to find that old magazine or online version to re-read it and see how relevant it is. 


Gluten intolerance remains fairly rare, and often not particularly severe. We have higher expectations for our own health now that we ever had in the past, so historically, people with a sensitivity to gluten may have just ignored it.

Further, while many people relied on wheat-based food products, it wasn't the only diet out there, and only became as dominant as it is now in the 20th century.
One person I knew who was allergic to gluten said that she was able to eat wheat in other countries; it was only wheat grown and processed in the US that gave her digestive problems. Her grandmother had the same issue.
The wheat of today and the wheat of our ancestors is vastly different in terms of constitution, cultivation and processing. It has been hybridized for greater yield, bathed in pesticides and then largely stripped of its remaining nutrition to produce the ubiquitous wheat flour that is in a huge percentage of our foods today. Our bodies have had essentially 1-2 generations to adapt to this largely new food product that has more differences than similarities to the ancient grain and subsequent processing our ancestor's bodies were accustomed to. 

Also, ITT people are conflating true wheat (gluten) allergy with wheat (gluten) sensitivity. These are matters of degree and have significant differences. 

edit: sp
This doesn't account for the last 5k years, but this article has a bit on the history of the discovery and diagnosis of celiac disease, http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/05/24/529527564/doctors-once-thought-bananas-cured-celiac-disease-it-saved-kids-lives-at-a-cost

It was a mystery in the 30s when it started to become more widely recognized, but doctor's still didn't find the cause of the allergy until the 50s following world war II. A dutch doctor, "noticed that in the last few years of World War II, when bread was unavailable in the Netherlands, the mortality rate from celiac disease dropped to zero."

Before that point and before the time period this article covered, people would more than likely die from an allergy to gluten and people would see it as severe malnutrition and gastrointestinal problems but not be able to  determine why. Now we have more information and diagnostic tools to be able to identify gluten allergies so it seems like the rate has increased dramatically when really its just finally getting noticed. 
Allergies aren't something that dissappear because of natural selection. Gluten intolerance isn't even the weirdest one you can have. You can be allergic to:

- Pollen, which have always been everywhere.
- Cats and dogs, while humans have been keeping dogs for a long time.
- Semen. Yep.
- Water, I had a minor water allergy when I was younger.

None of those make any sense when looking at our history, but an allergy is (most of the time) just your immune system that lost track about what's good and bad.


It's actually simpler than it seems if you separate an auto-immune disorder (celiac), from the intestinal distress, bloating, and discomfort many people experience from bread.

The processes in which bread is made normally includes a "ripening" time where the dough rises and the yeast digests fully or partially pre-digests for you the parts of the wheat that cause digestive distress.

In an effort to maximise efficiency large scale, must speed up the process usually by using additives to the yeast to let the bread rise faster and allow for faster preparation times. Even your local baker can't let bread rise for 2-24 hours (depending on the bread) while checking it in between, it needs more predictability and consistency.

The rise of wheat intolerance (not celiac) falls nicely inline with mechanisation of the production line of bread products.
Reddit has a weird hate boner about gluten, so a lot of folks are going to tell you the rise in allergies is psychosomatic. [That's not true:](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain) 

> For reasons that remain largely unexplained, the incidence of celiac disease has increased more than fourfold in the past sixty years. Researchers initially attributed the growing number of cases to greater public awareness and better diagnoses. But neither can fully account for the leap since 1950. Murray and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic discovered the increase almost by accident. Murray wanted to examine the long-term effects of undiagnosed celiac disease. To do that, he analyzed blood samples that had been taken from nine thousand Air Force recruits between 1948 and 1954. The researchers looked for antibodies to an enzyme called transglutaminase; they are a reliable marker for celiac disease. **Murray assumed that one per cent of the soldiers would test positive, matching the current celiac rate. Instead, the team found the antibodies in the blood of just two-tenths of one per cent of the soldiers.** Then they compared the results with samples taken recently from demographically similar groups of twenty- and seventy-year-old men. In both groups, the biochemical markers were present in about one per cent of the samples.

The whole article is interesting, and it's well reported (it's from the New Yorker, not some sketchy clickbait "GlutenAlert365.com" meme your aunt posts on Facebook). 
So there's a lot at work here.  Ignoring whether or not I believe anyone who said they have trouble eating wheat (because I'm not such an asshole that I'll call someone a liar about how they feel when they eat food) I'll say this.  5000 years is basically an evolutionary hiccup.  It's nothing compared to the million years we've been humans. Also, if we accept that something about eating wheat isn't ideal for the digestive system, then it stands to reason that the damage done is not short term.  Long term woes (those that occur over decades) don't really impact evolution. Moreover, the way modern people eat wheat IS dldifferent than it was in the past.  Our wheat is a different subspecies, it is prepared differently, in different quantities, and with greater frequency.  

On top of that  it's eaten WITH different things that compound bodily stress (that is to say, he amounts of sugar and corn products).  Hard to say whether the combinations might be important (like joker makeup). 
One thing bout biological evolution.  If it doesn't kill you before you breed, or inhibit breeding in any other way, it will not be thinned out from the gene pool.
Traditional (sourdough) bread only had three ingrediants: flour, water, and salt. But bread needs to rise and this took a lot of time before there was additives such as fast acting yeast and leaven. 

A sourdough bacterial culture takes 5 days to cultivate and when you create the bread you'll need to let the dough rise for another 12-24 hours before baking it. 

This slow fermentation process breaks down the difficult to digest gluten fibres in the bread, And this does not happen now with fast acting yeast and leaven and it's just now kicking our butt. 

A great book on this topic is Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation by Michael Pollan. It has also been turned into a documentary on Netflix.
I knew this kid that used to come to our regular poker games who was celiac. 

He had that look about him, the one that says "i've spent 8% of my life on the toilet." 

Our games would go pretty late - 5am or later - and around midnight these fat fucks we played with would order their burgers and donuts. When the food came this kid would high-tail the fuck out of there and basically sit in a locked room, waiting for these animals to devour midnight snack. When the coast was clear, celiac boy would come out with wet wipes, sanitize all surfaces and swap out the decks to his own clean cards. 

Decent player, nice dude, good-looking and smart but being in the same room as a cruller would turn him into a shit volcano for weeks
A short and efficient answer would be that something has changed about humans that is unrelated to genetics. For example, if gut flora populations were modified by modern diet, stress, sedentary lifestyle, chemical exposure, or any other factor, that would impact our ability to digest certain foods (as well as mental health demograhpics).
I literally once watched a documentary on bread... don't ask I love bread. But they mentioned how the strains of wheat they farmed in ancient civilizations don't even exist today. Also, that type of wheat was hand-milled, fermented and then baked. Apparently, there some very rustic/homemade types of sourdough bread that do not irritate those who are normally allergic/intolerant to gluten.
Most people who do not eat gluten are not actually allergic to it, by which I mean they do not have a histamine reaction. There are, however, many other factors which discourage it's consumption.

1. Genetic modification. Over the past fifty years especially, we have bred wheat to have more and more of the glutenous protein because it's what makes pizza and other bread products so stretchy and delicious. Our bodies may be having trouble keeping up. This means our gut can't digest it as easily. 

2. Processing. White bread was a miracle once! But it lacks the fiber, fats, and nutrients that wheat originally had. Bad for you? Maybe. Good for you? No. Bread products are rarely fermented anymore, which was arguably the most important step in being able to eat flour. Gluten causes awful neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms for me, but I can eat homemade (truly fermented) wheat sourdough no problem.

3. Overabundance. Gluten and various derivatives are used in almost every processed food, so our consumption levels are somewhat camouflaged. This also means that when you cut out gluten, you're also cutting out a lot of preservatives, sugars, and other fairly undesirable food products.

4. Inflammation. Whether due to our inability to digest it or other reasons, gluten is known to cause inflammation, in levels that vary person to person. Inflammation in your gut reduce your body's ability to absorb nutrients. Whether or not you're allergic to gluten, reducing systemic inflammation by not eating can have benefits in a wide variety of disorders, from MS to schizophrenia to Krohns and beyond.

5. Chemicals. In America at least, many farms douse their fields in RoundUp just before harvest because it increases yield. That means the wheat is full of heavy chemicals. For Americans at least, we may not be allergic to wheat, but heavy chemicals can still mess you up pretty badly.

[Here](https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain/amp) is a New Yorker article that discusses many factors. 

Edit: link
Celiac has been around for thousands of years. It has been identifiable more recently. Many people that actually have Celiac don't know they have it. For instance my younger sister was diagnosed at a young age, and it typically runs in the family. Doctors think my grandmother had it and never had it diagnosed, similar to my father.https://www.csaceliacs.org/history_of_celiac_disease.jsp This shows some proof of origins reaching back 2000 years.  

edit- bad spelling
My understanding is that the rise of gluten-sensitivities has less to do with the food, and more to do with the farming and harvesting methods.  Roundup has been around since 1974, and has been used by nearly every farmer in the country until relatively recently with the rise of organic farms.  A common practice is to spray the whole wheat crop down with roundup shortly before harvesting in order to reduce the strain on machinery.  There's still a lot of debate on this matter, but I have a feeling we're going to look back on modern farming techniques the same way we view surgery during the civil war.
One possible reason: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_desiccation

The hypothesis is basically that the practice of crop desiccation causes wheat in the food supply to contain traces of glyphosate, which in turn causes allergic reactions. I.e., perhaps it isn't the wheat, it's what's on/in the wheat.
Shortest answer: Bread was made out of different grains throughout our history - spelt, emmer (Farro), and einkorn to name a few.
Most people who think they're allergic to gluten are not, in fact, allergic to gluten. Only about 1% of Americans, for example, have the actual medical condition. About 10x that many have convinced themselves that they have a problem with gluten through casual observations and assumptions. 
There's no scientific evidence for it. Celiac disease is a thing. Gluten intolerance appears not to be. A lot of people say they have it, but there is no evidence under lab conditions. Here's an easy to read article that cites sources: http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/does-non-celiac-gluten-intolerance-actually-exist/
Combination of: 
A lot of people who claim a gluten allergy/sensitivity are just people eating better and blaming it on the gluten free part of their new diet--trading tons of pasta/pizza/cookies/etc. for fresh fruits and vegetables is bound to make anyone feel better

Hygiene hypothesis (and other possible causes) for an increase in allergies overall

Some gluten tolerances were relatively minor annoyances "back then", it's only in modern times that we have time and energy to worry about things like stomach aches

And finally, people with true Celiac disease simply died. It could be chalked up to some common ailment like the flu or a stomach bug, humans didn't have much time or ability to investigate things like that before the modern era.

"Gluten allergies" are what people call intolerance of things made with wheat, but there are several factors: 

* Modern wheat is covered with loads of pesticides
* Modern commercial bakers use chemical leaveners instead of fermenting breads

If a person can distinguish between them, say can eat pasta but not bread, that person may be allergic to chemical leaveners.  
We are locking this thread because of the high number of off-topic and soapboxing/argumentative posts.
[The vast majority of people who claim gluten sensitivity, etc, are just deluded.](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/06/11/think-youre-sensitive-to-gluten-think-again) Actual gluten sensitivities are pretty rare, celiac much rarer still, and wheat allergies the rarest of all.

But how did that survive? Allergies aren't hereditary (though there is thought to be a genetic component), and most of this stuff isn't serious enough to kill you before you have a chance to breed.
Part of the equation is education and the availability of alternatives, another is fad elimination diets.

Celiac disease is difficult to diagnose and wasn't widely understood until relatively recently. It affects around 1 in 100 people and can be life threatening if gluten isn't eliminated entirely from the diet. That's not the same as a gluten allergy, but the recognition of it has caused a surge in foods that are safe for sufferers (and fad followers) to eat. 

This is part of a broader trend over the past couple of decades, where food companies have realized the demand for alternative products - consider, when compared to a decade ago, how many different milks are available now, how many foods are nut-free, or vegan, or paleo and so on. It's part real health needs, part fad, but all necessary to remain competitive if you're selling processed food.
 
Because most people aren't allergic to it.  They jumped on the gluten free bandwagon.  Studies are starting to show that avoiding gluten, if you don't actually have gluten intolerance, is bad because you miss out on the nutrients and vitamins your body needs.  Gluten free is a fad, people think it will help them lose weight, but it's not cutting the gluten that helps lose weight.  Plus gluten just sounds like a nasty thing.  So people believe it needs to be eliminated from their diets.

http://www.webmd.com/diet/healthy-kitchen-11/truth-about-gluten
We do not actually have a large number of people allergic to bread. We have some, and due to finding it they are more likely to survive till adulthood, and we are better at identifying people with Celiac, but we have not actually had a major increase in either from historical norms. Identifying something better is not an increase. 

Most of what you are seeing is not even people with a gluten intolerance, gluten allergy, or Celiac. It is the current fad diet and pseudo-scientific dietary advice demonizing gluten causing people to avoid that we are seeing. 
Those genetics didn't survive. 200 years ago those would die and not pass it down to their offspring.
Some people mix up gouten intolerance with fructose malabsorption. An easy way to find out is to switch from bread with high fructose corn syrup to bread without which is usually more expensive.
- Celiac leads to failure to absorb nutrients, if you don't absorb nutrients then you die from either starvation or "failure to thrive" due to the resulting weakening of your immune system that leaves you succeptible to all sorts of other things.  So many people just didn't live to adulthood if they didn't figure out to avoid it. Allergy (not celiac) would lead to a major immediate response upon eating, which likely could also kill someone if severe, or lead someone to avoid the thing altogether. Intolerance (also not celiac) would cause mostly minor discomforts that wouldn't really be noticable to most people concerned more with survuival than optimal health. 

- Testing availability and knowledge. Even just about a decade or two ago, there were doctors who still didn't know about celiac and the only way to be diagnosed formally involved a stomach biopsy (not a simple procedure), so most people with it were not formally diagnosed and so not recorded as having celiac for any sort of reporting - typically they would just try to avoid gluten bearing foods as a result of that being a possiblity, and if it worked keep it up. 
Actual medically diagnosed gluten sensitivities, due either to Celiac Disease or allergy, remain extremely rare. There is zero evidence that either of those conditions are any more common today than they were a thousand years ago.

However, they do exist. There are, and always have been, people among us who are negatively impacted by gluten. The difference is that those people now have access to social media where they can tell many, many people at a time how terrible their symptoms are. And a lot of those people hear that and wrongly believe that gluten is bad for everybody. They begin to manifest psychosomatic symptoms, futher convincing them. Then they find out, after further research, that not everybody has this sensitivity. But their imagined symptoms convince them that they themselves do. Thus is born their claim of gluten sensitivity in the absence of any medical diagnosis. 

The same exact thing has happened with aspartame. There is an exceedingly rare condition called phenylketonuria that makes aspartame very toxic to its sufferers. I knew a girl in highschool who had it. Aspartame would give her seizures. But, like I said, it's rare. For anybody without phenylketonuria, aspartame is harmless. But the symptoms of phenylketonuria hit social media and people read about it and concluded that aspartame must be terribly toxic! The result is that a huge movement of scientifically illiterate people are now anti-aspartame. Nevermind that this logic is exactly the same as saying that nobody should ever eat seafood because some people are allergic to it.  (Personally, I avoid aspartame drinks because they all taste like the first syllable in "aspartame" - but I'm not afraid of them.) 


Because "gluten allergies" are not a real thing for 99.991% of the people who say they are afflicted.
There are not many people "allergic" to glutens. It's just another health food fad.

Yes, gluten sensitivity does exist...but very few people actually have it. Most are just Nocebo'ing themselves into having symptoms.
Stone ground wheat flour of yesteryear is not the same as enriched wheat flour of today.

It is missing key nutrients. 
Food writer here: Recent studies suggest the changes to wheat that were engineered (by grafting, not GMO processes) in the early 1960s to increase yields changed the basic structure of wheat in ways that have made it harder for many people to digest. This theory has been substantiated somewhat by anecdotal evidence that many people with gluten sensitivities (not celiacs) are able to enjoy and easily digest products made with heirloom wheat--which is unchanged from its original form. Eli Rogosa's "Restoring Heritage Grains" goes into this in detail.  
99% of people on gluten diets are not allergic to gluten, they're merely hopping on a bandwagon where people think gluten is bad for you. Gluten is only bad for you if you have celiac disease, which is extremely rare. The media has interviewed people who claim to be on gluten-free diets if they know what gluten is or what it does and almost all of them had no clue other than "it's bad for you", "it makes you fat", "companies add it into bread as a chemical additive",etc...
http://grainfoodsfoundation.org/reviews_gffs_take/netflix-cooked-episode-air/ 
Watch Cooked on Netflix episode 3 "Air" 
It's more of a doc about food than a cooking show

My theory: Because wheat now is pretty different than 100 years ago. In the agricultural revolution of the 50s and 60s wheat was cross bred to create shorter strains, therfore reducing the height of the wheat and increasing potential yield. Wheat was so tall it would tend to fall and rot when moisture got to it. Having a shorter height avoided loss of potential yield. All this is of course an addendum to other comments regarding detection, recording, incidence and increased awareness. 
one answer could be that bread used to take multiple days to make, and it only recently began to be made in a matter of hours. I watched a documentary on Netflix, called 'whats with wheat' or somethin like that. look it up. its a good doc.
Netflix has a show called Cooked where a guy argues that it has to do with the lack of properly fermenting the dough. So theres that. Quick rising yeast and industrialization of bread vs proper slow bread making
My guess would be the wide use of antibiotics for starters. Some meds might destroy too much good gut flora but leave a bad bacteria unaffected. C.Diff is a more extreme example of this. It could just be killing off certain bacteria diminishes your ability to properly digest certain foods and enzymes. 
Not every culture survived off bread for 5000 years. Lots of cultures eat predominantly corn, rice, or tef, all of which are gluten free.
A few have already said this, but Celiac Disease (an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system reacts to the gluten protein negatively, i.e. "allergy") is different from gluten intolerance (which is just the bodies' inability to properly digest the gluten proteins).  

They are not the same thing. And many people who go to restaurants who say they are "allergic to gluten" are just people who change their diet because the "feel better" without gluten. Although they could be right, most of the folks who make this determination but have not taken a true test are at best guessing, but at most probably just intolerant.  So the numbers are probably a lot skewed.  As the saying goes beggars can't be choosers... but we in modern society can.  

As for the numbers of allergies increasing; there are a lot of theory. The most quoted one is the hygiene hypothesis. Also, frankly, I don't buy that one (at least not completely). For one, there are clearly other factors at play; e.g. what kind of diseases one is exposed to (and there what kind of immune response the body mounts), where one lives, where one was born and where one moves to.  Most of the hypothesis are still guessing at it... but the real answer is we don't really yet know why we have more allergies than previous centuries.  But also, we have factors more people than we ever had before. Many kids in the old days didn't make it pass childhood, so perhaps many people before died before they reached adulthood due to some of these factors.  My guess is that all of the hypothesis probably contribute in some way.  

TL;DR -- Most people who claim "allergy" to gluten are probably intolerant. And for the most part we don't really know why overall allergies have increased... but probably a due to many factors combined.

What I've heard is that the strains of wheat which are now most commonly grown in my country have triple the gluten that they did a generation or two ago, let alone compared to the wheat we as a species have been accustomed to eating since the dawn of grain consumption. Our digestive systems have not adapted to such an increase in such a short time.
Because we have so many alternatives now.  We also have science and modern medicine.  The reason so many people who are allergic to gluten and peanuts even exist now is because natural selection can no longer weed those traits out.  That goes for a lot of diseases and genetic traits now.  Before medicine those people would just die and not pass on their genes.  Now they survive and the gluten allergies thrive.  There was a Louis CK joke I remember about how when we drop food like peanut butter to starving African or Middle Eastern children we don't hear about them whining about their nut allergies. That's because they:
A: starve
B: eat the peanut butter, have a nut allergy, die for lack of medical care
C: eat the peanut butter and survive

TL;DR natural selection isn't working on humans anymore because science and medicine counter act it
Celiac Disease is pretty rare still, around 1% incidence in the United States. And non-celiac "gluten intolerance" or "gluten allergies" aren't a thing, so mostly it's just a psychological phenomenon/placebo effect/trendy diet. 
[Antibiotic overuse](https://chriskresser.com/has-antibiotic-overuse-caused-a-celiac-disease-epidemic/) might play some role
Wheat from the west was hybrided with our own in the US, basically forced because it would yield more wheat even though it was basically a failed hybrid. This with pesticides and herbicides and over consumption of it. There is a good documentary on this called whats with wheat I believe, its on netflix.
My wife contracted celiac disease in her mid thirties after having multiple issues in a short period of time.  She had her gall bladder out (gallstones) and appendix out in a short time period after developing an abcess in her digestive tract.  Sort of a perfect storm of digestive issues all at the same time.  Her theory is that the high doses of antibiotics she was on during that time wiped out the good and bad bacteria in her digestive tract in effect doing a reset on her immune system and somehow in doing so making gluten a problem.  Previously she had no problems with gluten.  They had diagnosed her with celiac disease around that time.  That was about six years ago and has been gluten free out of necessity ever since.  She has gotten "glutened" (her word) on occasion that proves this is still a problem but the prevalence of gluten free foods has been a big help to her.

Bread is made differently than it was 100s of years ago. Most bread was like traditional sourdough. [Not the sourdough you buy at the supermarket](http://gnowfglins.com/2017/01/11/is-store-bought-sourdough-true-sourdough-aw057/) that has added vinegar, the traditional stuff is fermented which makes it taste sour-ish.

This type of traditional bread has [lower gluten contents](http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(10)00987-0/abstract) and [some celiac patients can eat it without ill effects](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sourdough-breadmaking-cuts-gluten-content-in-baked-goods-1.2420209).

Obligatory I'm not a doctor, or even knowledgeable in the subject... but...

I've kinda wondered if there actually is an increase. Much like the increase in peanut allergies.  But rather: Is it possible that simply our understanding of the cause of these things has increased thus resulting in many people actually becoming aware of what's causing their reactions / problems?  Edit: Also with social media and a much more connected world, sometimes these small parts of a population can seem to have a much larger voice than what they really do (not saying we shouldn't care though).
Can I just say this thread makes me really happy. :) I fully expected to open this and find a whole bunch of "whatever, Gluten intolerance is made up and only people with Celiacs can complain!" I understand Celiacs must suuuuuuck! They definitely get dibs, But it's also pretty lame to have insane back pain, cramps, headaches etc., and deal with people saying you're making it up :/ Like no, I don't eat pizza and doughnuts because I'm in it for the long con /s 🙄 
Edit: scrolled further and there was almost word for word that comment, so I guess there was some of that here, but at least there was mostly helpful stuff here! :)
Yes it's a thing, but people are making it a fad. Remember low carb? Or sugar free? Each thing well get a momentary rise until they find something else to blame for there weight and not use their own self control. 
The reason so many people are *now* having a bad reaction to gluten is due entirely to the food manufacturing business and monoculture farming practices.

Simply put, wheat has been modified from it's long holistic history of human farming, when the grain was ground into wheat and the stalks dried into straw. 

This documentary, ["What's with Wheat"](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80175827?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C0%2C65816674a82dbf141d1f8e4cc3b98d54905df8c6%3Aa0063866ca1197bddc714c3c615f834340f29369) on Netflix is pretty explanatory.

The TL;DW is that due to the demands of both monoculture farming practices and the manufactured foods industry, wheat has been modified from it's longtime farmed form in the last 50 years, and now contains much more gluten than previously.

Add to that the practice of using wheat in just about every manufacturing process, from shampoo to heaven knows what, and it's impossible tell how much gluten one actually absorbs based on food labels alone.

Did I mention how heavily subsidized wheat production is? And that it's a commodity being heavily traded in the stock markets? There's more than one influence on the push to create ever-more-modified plants.
Less than half of a percent of people have some sort of **actual** gluten intolerance. Its not "so many". For the most part, gluten-free is a stupid "health" trend that became popular because it made people lose weight, and they incorrectly attributed it to the lack of gluten, when in reality anything with gluten in it also has carbohydrates, and westerners typically consumer waaaaaaayy too many carbs in the first place.
I have a friend that once claimed he was lactose intolerant because he didn't like the taste of milk.

Caveat: I am **NOT** one of the anti-GMO crowd.

That said, I know an intelligent doctor who believes, based on cases he has dealt with over several years, that GMO grains have starches and proteins that are not *quite* what we are adapted to.

And that these are the source of all the new allergies,

Personally, GMO foods have never caused me any problems, but I wonder if he could be onto something.
They aren't really allergic. A very small portion of the population is, but it's "hip" to be gluten free.
Because our farming industry is using round up to dry the entire wheat field out 7-10 days before pulling the crop. It adds additional wheat to the harvest but remains in the food after production. Great idea in motion since the early 90's. 
It could very well be that this is just a case of not knowing what it was until quite recently, since the symptoms can be very different.
IMO: we started using quick rise yeast in the early 20th century and stopped making fermented sourdough. The fermentation process actually breaks down most of the gluten.  Probably a mix of this and all the other things listed in this thread. 

Try making real sourdough bread - it's like having a pet... that you eat
We don't. A lot of people eat gluten free because it's another healthy sounding option along with the organic food that many shop for. 

More people think they have an allergy or intolerance to gluten than actually do. Way, way more. That inflates the numbers.
I have two theories. Not everyone who is allergic to gluten isn't actually allergic to it. They might just think they are or they're trying to be cool. Also with the population so large you're going to see a lot more people with those "rare" conditions like 1:10,000 etc.
[removed]
In those 5,000 years, the allergic people died young, and thus the allergy was rarely passed on. 

I believe that most of them never knew what hit them.

I'm entirely theorizing here, but please bear with me.

Modern medicine has made the life expectancy increase by treating the causes and symptoms of most common diseases. 

Not so long ago, before vaccines, pills, and treatment, most diseases were deadly. Mental dissorders were treated as "demonic possesion" or worse.

Because of the living conditions, you either were healty, or died. There was no middle ground on health unless you were really wealthy, because there was no (effective) treatment for almost anything.

So, most people had two choices:

* Live without any or little health issues.
* Die.

In this case, you either ate whatever everyone else ate, if you were healthy, die of starvation, or eat and die (probably) because of the sympthoms

Nowadays however, we know what causes most disseases, so when there is no cure, there is at least paliative treatment to ease the sympthoms (as in this case, you just dont eat gluten)

And although gluten intolerance, gluten allergies and celiac dissease, as todays standards, aren't particularly severe, for people living in the past it was probably a big deal. Think of this: today, if you get the flu you will probably think of a week off of work, but only in the last century it has killed millions.
[removed]
[removed]
Possibly because those people simply died back in the die and now live long enough to be diagnosed. 
The diseases incompatible with life would have resulted with death in the first months or years in life, and that isn't surprising with the insane infant death mortality rates up until a century ago.  
The diseases that were just a problem but the people still lived with the diseases as a debilitating factor to their life and there wasn't anyone to diagnose or to treat that. 
Increased awareness of symptoms relating to gluten and wheat allergies means that issues that used to be ignored are now taken seriously. However, allergies and auto-immune issues has been on the rise and we still do not know the cause of this. But increased awareness is a part of it.
[removed]
The celiac disease cabal has been successful in their bid to have better options when eating out. Their plot to convince health nutters that they are allergic to gluten and so demand non-gluten foods be available took years to pull off, but pull it off they have.
The people who were allergic or had celiac disease died as infants or children, or whenever the allergy/disease manifested. Now we save many people before they can die and that generates a population of allergic people to witness all around.

I read a great vook on this buy a doctor wgos study food allergens dor 30 years. Its called "the plant paradox". Please read it. These guys arent going tongive you anything you havent heard already. 
The implication in your question gives me pause, someone correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe 5000 years is actually enough time for natural selection to 100% select out a trait (you might have been using hyperbole, not trying to be a smart ass if you were). 

Also natural selection pretty much only works on traits that can inhibit reproductive success (someone might have said this already). This is partly why we still have things like Huntington's disease, which isn't lethal until after your reproductive years.
Anti microbial hand soaps, hand towels, hand lotions, and whatever else anti microbial we have... Toilet paper, gum, candy, whatever.

Alter your gut flora and you're in for all sorts of fucked up shit.
I am guessing that it's just being diagnosed more, I am sure there have been generations of families, going back hundreds of years, with gluten intolerances. It was just that nobody was able to link the symptoms to the cause until recently.
I'd just like to say that Europeans who primarily subsisted off of bread only made up a small proportion of the world's population. Before colonial times the entire globe was inhabited by indigenous populations. Just in the Americas alone there were between 50 to 100 million natives. They had arguably the greatest agrecultur systems in the world, domesticating hundreds of different crops. I find it a bit insulting that you refer to the Europeans as "humanity" when they had shit agriculture, rampant diseases​, high rates of mental illness and violence, and the most despicable and intalerble religions. They spread diseases and butchered there way across the world. And unfortunately many of their mentalities persist to this day.
I am one of the super special "delusional" people with non-celiac gluten intolerance and I assure you it is not imaginary.... however, it may not be the wheat itself making us react. There is a theory out there--and before I go any further I must carefully state I am not blaming GMOs for their existence!!!! But there is a theory gaining some ground that because GMO wheat is mainly modified to withstand much stronger doses of pesticides than ever before in our agricultural history, what non-celiac people are experiencing is a reaction to the pesticides and not the wheat itself. This is obviously still a somewhat woo crunchy granola theory at this point but there is anecdotal evidence and to me it makes sense that some bodies would digest it no problem while others would be sensitive to it, like how my spouse can spray himself in 100% deet bug spray while it gives me hives.
My brother has Hashimoto's disease which is an autoimmune disease similar, but not as severe, as celiac and requires a gluten free diet. The presence of gluten came about in the past 200 years or so with genetic engineering. The goal was to create a high-yield grain and in the process, gluten became more prevalent. (Breads and pastas in Europe have less gluten content than the US because of these practices.) A lot of comments in here are saying that many people falsely diagnose themselves with a gluten intolerance. But the human body actually does not produce the enzymes necessary to digest gluten. So in a sense, everyone is gluten intolerant to some degree. Some just have more severe reactions. 

Gluten affects the small intestine where we absorb all the nutrients from our food. Because we can't properly digest gluten, it often clogs the small intestine so no matter how much you eat, your brain is still telling you to eat more because it hasn't absorbed nearly enough nutrients. This can result in chemical brain imbalances (anxiety, depression etc.) and physical ailments (headaches, joint pain etc.)

I realize that the gluten free crap comes off as obnoxious but I can't recommend it enough. And not just getting gluten free bread and pasta but truly healthy alternatives. Looking into paleo and keto diets are an awesome resource.
I really have no evidence, but just a theory. I would assume bread wasn't readily available in such vast quantities until the last few centuries but more so in the last century. Maybe that's why it's a more recent identifiable occurance

I'm sure Celiac's and other gluten related illness has been around for thousands of years though
5,000 years?

Try 200,000 years, sir/ma'am.


EDIT: I'll settle on this.
http://thepaleodiet.com/dr-cordain-comments-on-new-evidence-of-early-human-grain-consumption/
Most bread for most regions was gluten free anyway. Most bread was a flat bread of grains like spelt, kamut, and such. 

Then you need to realize that even if people in the past where celiac they would be undiagnosed and just suffer their whole lives not knowing what the cause was.

ELI5: How did we get to the point where laptops and smartphones are in the same price range?

The difference is that most people are buying the top spec smartphones ($1000+), but not nearly as many people buy top spec laptops ($2500+).
Demand for fancier phones with bigger screens and better cameras = higher cost, more people willing to pay for them.

That being said, this is only true if you're comparing very specific subsets of price ranges. Laptops are still notably more expensive. Unless you're say, comparing a middle of the road phone to a low end laptop which isn't really a fair comparison.

Looking at only big namebrands here to remove extreme outliers.

A low-end smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A10) might be $120. A low-end laptop (Asus Chromebook C523) might be $240.

A top-end smartphone (iPhone XS Max) might be $1500. A top-end laptop might be anywhere from $2500 for a more general purpose high-performer (High end macbook pro) or $3200+ for a high-end gaming laptop with a high-end display (ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701)
A smartphone is a handheld computer that does most of the computing you need at any given moment of the day, occasionally you can use it to make phone calls.  A laptop is a more powerful computer, usually, that allows you to do the stuff you can't do with the smartphone.  You pay what you pay for a smartphone for the convenience and you pay what you do for a laptop for what it offers.

I like having a computer that can also make phone calls in my pocket throughout the day, having a laptop for school/work, and having a desktop setup for everything else.

Having a sweet camera is a thing I can understand, but a thousand bucks?
Why aren’t smartphones getting cheaper?  I remember buying my first big screen TV, a 1080p 50” plasma for almost $2k.  Now all TV’s are much better and much cheaper.  Smartphones? The iPhone I bought years ago was cheaper than the iPhones now.  Maddening.

Most consumers don't know about ram, rom, storage, processor speed.

So instead most people buy the new brand-name with the bigger number. 

You can get relatively cheap phones and computers if you buy based on the actual specs instead of whatever is being marketed as new.
I have a Note 9 with dock, mouse, keyboard, HDMI, and external hard drive. Also available with 8 gigs of RAM. Phones blow my mind especially as a custom PC guy. I used to get real excited for an upgrade that was nothing compared to this phone.
You pay for performance and portability. Laptops cost more than their performance equivalent desktops because smaller and more specialized parts are required to get the performance. More technology tends to go into them as well. Phones are the same way. More technology goes into your phone than probably anything else you deal with on a daily basis. That combined with the fact that smart phones are now the most portable computer we carry and use, and we no longer get carrier subsidies like we used to for signing two year contracts have made price you pay for the phone go up.
You're comparing high-end smartphones with mid and low end laptops. It isn't the same market.

But from an objective standpoint, the smartphones of today can fill many of the same functions as the laptops of old. And so it makes sense that they have risen in price.
As has been pointed out, they really aren’t. But phones probably should cost more. 

1. Miniaturization is expensive. 
2. Phones need cellular modems. 
3. Phones need better cameras. 
4. Phones have higher pixel density. 
5. Phones need GPS. 
6. Phones are getting waterproofing. 
7. Phones need to be more durable. 

There’s a bunch of other stuff that make phones way more impressive from an engineering POV. Laptops really only come with bigger versions of the same components which often isn’t actually that costly. Laptops have more connectors and a physical keyboard, but those aren’t super expensive either.
What are you actually asking about OP? Why are phones so expensive? Why are laptops so cheap?

The drive for more features in phones has been very strong over the past 10+ years. At this point a phone can do everything a laptop can, but is limited by OS and screen size. I can actually doc my phone over usbc, hook a larger screen and mouse and keyboard to it and use it like a PC.

The drive for laptops has been to provide a larger spectrum of options. Some being super light weight, others being very powerful, and some going cost above all else. There is way more diversity in laptops than in phones, making some from name brands cheaper than a phone.

The real question here is when is that line between phone and laptop going to be so blurred we will struggle to define it?
It is easy, because we pay for them. If apple came out with a 1500 dollar phone and not 1 person bought it what do you think would happen. They would have to lower the price it is that simple. Since the 1500 dollar phone would have thousands of idiots lined up outside to buy it they charge that much for it. Quit buying them as a whole and we gain the power back.
IMHO Apple had the brilliant idea of marketing and positioning their technical products as must-have status symbol fashion accessories. Certain people were willing to pay silly prices for gadgets that were technically not worth their asking price. Then others decided to follow.  
  
I recently upgraded to a $100 octa core phone with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and it's covering all my needs, including remote connecting to client PCs for maintenance.  
  
Quite a few people I know that buy $1k phones just use them to surf the net/Facebook. They justify spending the money because they spend "a lot of time on the phone", i.e. making calls, when call-making is probably the only feature that hasn't improved since pre-smartphones.
  
  
But at least they live up to society's measurement of social value.
Because people will pay the same for them.   Many times price is determined by what the market will pay.
You, the consumer. 

Demand and your wallet is what allowed these devices to exist at thier price ranges. 

And its hella complicated tech yo.
Apple sheep started it all by paying the insane price that they charged.   Remember when a Google Nexus phone was around $350 and iPhones were $700+
We got there at the time that a smartphone can do the same as a laptop for 80% of people. You can have a pc to share with your family, but all those Facebook/YouTube machines get obsolete once you can do it comfortably on your phone. The rise of smart TVs handled the movie/series part of laptop use and better web design made it possible to handle most of your internet doings through you phone (bills, banks, emails ...). Even gaming is being taken over and a large chunk of pc gaming has been canibalised by mobile. Now all you need a laptop for is work, writing something that isn't an email and gaming if you don't have a console.
Because phones are laptops now. When you're buying a laptop youre not really paying for the screen and the keyboard what takes up the majority of a laptop. Phones now are jamming all of that into a tiny little package. 

Look at it this way, the note 9 can be docked where I can run cat6, hdmi and keyboard and mouse to it. It has 512gb of storage, 8 gigs of ram and a 2.7 GHz processor. That is an insane amount of power in a tiny little pocket sized device.
Everything has gotten cheaper to produce but phone makers keep raising the price of their phones because people keep paying it. Good night.
On a phone, you have to cram a load of hardwarw into a tiny space, albeit not as powerful, ergo, not as hit components
What about gaming consoles or even PC's that cost less than smartphones?
They aren't. You can get a cheap smartphone for maybe $20-30. You can get a cheap laptop for maybe $200-300.

Companies like Apple and Samsung raise their prices, people line up to pay, so they raise it more next time, people still line up to pay and so on.

People are willing to spend a lot of money for phones so companies charge them that much.
It really depends on the product, as many have pointed out. My first smartphone was ~£50 whilst a decent Apple laptop will be in the thousand. Whereas a low end Dell might be a couple of hundred and a recent iPhone will be in the high hundreds.
I don’t know why I haven’t seen this higher on the list. It’s because my $800 phone is $30 per month. When I trade it in the next $1000 one is going to be $40 per month. So on and so forth. People don’t buy phones cash. No one saves up for a phone. They’re shiny things that we show off every day. I don’t carry around a laptop everyday and even if I did no one would know wtf it was. Phones are a fashion statement.
Miniaturization is expensive. As cell phone makers compete for customers, one of the main attributes is the technology behind the device. So as they try to miniaturize faster and more efficient processors, it costs a lot of money to do so. To give you an idea of how quickly technology has improved, the phone in my pocket has a faster processor and more memory than my first computer. If all we wanted was a device that just made phone calls and could send text messages, costs would probably stay very low (<$200; my first pager was $40 dollars). However, with the advent of the smartphone, we all want screens and applications that make our lives easier. We used to have devices called PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) that did this for us. Now we have phones with processors so powerful, we can add that capability to the device. So rather than carrying around multiple devices, we carry around one device that can do it all (make/take calls, schedule appointments on our calendar, portable calculator, read/send email, navigate, etc). I used to have a PDA, a portable navigation device in my car, and a flip phone for calls and text messages. Now I just have one device that does all that. As phone become more powerful, we are able to run more apps on them and keep more applications stored. This all comes at a cost. Think of your smartphone as a miniature computer. If you think of it that way, your laptop and phone are one in the same (eg. you can make/take calls on Skype on your laptop). The convenience of having one device over multiple devices is also great. So as technology improves, phone (and laptops) will follow suit.
A 1,000 phone might have $150-300 worth of components but many don't take into account the amount of money Samsung/Apple/Google spend on research and development, it's in the 10s of billions, and they spend that each year, Apple and Samsung alone spent 30+ billion in 2018. Plus there's manufacturing costs/logistics/shipping etc, and duties.
Traditionally different markup models.

PC market started as a marketplace of components. Altair 8080 is as sold as a kit, and since that very beginning you could assemble most successful models from parts. Assembling the PC was particularly easy, and parts were particularly ubiquitous and standardized.

Because of that, an assembled PC rely cost more than the bag of parts, and sometimes cost less. For a very long time the joke was that for a computer company shipping charge was the biggest profit center.

For various reasons, laptops followed the markup models of desktop PCs even though it was far more difficult to assemble them from parts, and there was a lot less standardization.

For consumer electronics the markups are huge. They are usually 3-4x the cost of bag of parts. If you are buying a $40 DVD player, it is likely that the cost to make it - including packaging - was below $15.

Cell phones traditionally were like consumer electronics rather than PCs, so a $1000 phone costs less than $300 to make, and $1000 computer costs more than $900 to make.
* Margins and Financials **require** a certain level to afford R&D and hiring "high paid" engineers
* Markets needing ever more features to be convinced to buy - which cost money
* Financing of cell phones is hidden in ways that PCs never had so you don't "see" the full price creep up
* Cell phones are seen far more as "commodities" to be replace often than PCs ever were or ever will be
* Smart phones are now used by the majority as how PCs were used but are better fit and form - thus they are merely "substitutes" for PCs for most people
* The market is willing to pay the price thus that IS the correct price (that's how pricing actually works).
$1000 of laptop gets you a lot more than $1000 of phone. Both are computers, ones just a lot more compact, and making things more compact is expensive.
What do you use more?
One large part of it that many people failed to mention, is the financing options available. You can get that $1,200 smart phone, and pay $40 a month with your plan, and it’s paid off in 2 years when you re-up your contract and go for the next iPhone or whatever in 2 years.

With laptops, you don’t have the ability to go into BestBuy, sign up for a data package, finance the laptop, and leave. To do that, you’d need to sign up for their credit card, which runs a HARD credit check, get approved, be in the limit and purchase. Then to use the laptop for most things, you need internet which is a separate entity in itself. 

A smartphone is all in one. You pay $100 and you have internet, call, text, and so much more.
It’s all about where miniaturization is at and where economies of scale kick in. 

Smartphones are still on the bleeding edge every generation packs in more power for the size format. The limit is what we can actually make. 

Laptops on the other hand are no longer getting meaningful gains in power / capability instead every generation reduces the cost to do stuff at given size. 

I.e. laptops went from $2000 for a 17” to $2000 for a 15” to $2000 for a 13” ultrabook while the price points drop at the larger form factors. Now there is almost zero cost difference between a desktop at a certain spec and the equivalent laptop at the same spec. 

We are now at the point where the divide between a highend smart phone, a tablet and an ultra book are becoming very thin and it’s all about what features and preferred usage patterns drive your need. 

Notice that foldable devices are currently at the bleeding edge? That’s because we are moving into an era of scalable devices. Your smartphone will become the device that expands back up into your laptop, gaming console, desktop pc.
Apple leads the phone market, their model has been to price gouge for the last 25 years. The competition, following a market leader who charges too much, does not have to compete on price. Consumers lose, the end.
Laptops are more powerful than phones. But they are much bigger. Its far cheaper to build electronics with larger components.

Phones are expensive because everyone insists on buying the latest new smartphones. There are lots of other cheaper mid range phones which are just as good. Or you can buy new phones of older models. For me I bought my honor 10 lite phone for under $200. Camera is not as good as the latest iPhone, but apart from that it fits my needs.
Simple, people are fucking stupid and bend over for shitty companies to be able to flaunt to other people they don't even know on social media!

Personal computers on the other hand; people don't know dogshit about those and no use showcasing them on social media.
When I was a teenager my phone had like 100 pixels. Now it has more pixels than my 55” 4K TV. Why is someone confused that top-end phones are expensive now?
Making things tiny and good is more expensive than making things small and good. Phones have lots of tiny, so this costs many monies. Laptops have mostly smalls, which is fewer monies. For one monies, you get more laptop than phone. So to get enough laptop takes less money.
Pocket portability has a price tag and most people don't need the features of a laptop daily (if they have a solid smartphone).

So price goes up for the smaller ones because it can. People will keep buying them.
Dont forget home pcs used to cost thousands of dollars. Hard drives that had storage in the MBs when they first came out were hundreds or thousands themselves before they took over from the big floppys and other more cumbersome storage media. Prices come down significantly but the newest and best is always pricey at first
Very easily.  For one thing, the now big manufacturers have at some point addressed Apple's pricing strategy.  Because if someone spends a lot of money senselessly, others will do it too.  And after smartphones do not bring real innovation anymore, they're putting in superfluous things like 2 or 3 cameras and other nonsense to keep the price high. (the mobile boom was 2011-2014)
I don't know, all I know is that my laptop, a 2009 Dell Latitude model with integrated graphics and 8 GB RAM, cost the same as my phone, a Samsung S7 Edge with 4 GB RAM and a resolution 4 times my laptop screen. 600 USD.
Smartphones have some amazing tech that deserves a premium, but the current prices we're seeing are not just because of the parts involved. The manufacturers are increasing prices regularly and testing what's the breaking point for consumers. Apple's sales have dipped since they hit $1000 for their new devices. But they're maintaining it and seeing whether it won't hurt their bottomline much. 

>The profit margins are the lowest for entry-level devices such as the now discontinued iPhone SE that fetched $399 and costs $186.70 to make, resulting in a profit margin of 53 percent for the company.

>During its heydays, the company reportedly pocketed 74 cents of every $1 made on the sale of each iPhone. However, the earnings have gone down since, and now Apple’s profit margin has reduced to 60 percent for every iPhone unit sold. Despite the dip, Apple continues to take the lion’s share of the industry’s profit home. Even though iPhones account for 20 percent of the smartphone sales, Apple earns a whopping 87 percent of the industry’s profit.

This is from Nov, 2018. 

60% profit margin is a lot. Now you know why they're one of the richest companies in the world.

Other top-end smartphone manufactures are just following in their footsteps as far as price is concerned.
Smartphones are on an easy to finance plan. I just bought a new one today and it cost me nothing right now, but I pay for it monthly.
Most of people are nitpicking questions just to contradict it. Jf you think about question,  you would know what he is asking is a real issue.
Several reasons. First is design. Laptops have much more space than a smartphone. Cramming in components requires lot more development resources.
Laptops have much larger screens too. Developing and manufacturing a 5" full HD display is significantly costlier than a 15" full HD display. Also as someone else pointed out, the top end smartphone is aroi d $1000 while top end laptops are well above $2500.
A low end 1080p display smartphone starts at around $170. Also the top end smartphones have oled displays.
Smartphone hardware is also generally on cutting edge of tech. Not so much with laptops.
I know!! If I have to pay near $2000 for a phone what am I going to have to pay for a new laptop when I need one. 

Also might be that people upgrade there phone more than they do a laptop. So laptop prices come down and phone prices go up.
How did we get to a point where none of it lasts longer than 3-5 years. They are literally making garbage. I want quality products!
Isn’t downsizing extremely costly. So I mean ofc a laptop can do a lot more, but currently phones aren’t that far behind. But it’s very difficult to actually downsize the phones hardware.? So maybe that’s why they are still so expensive.
Sooo, imagine it like this- making tiny tech is difficult= more costly.

But there’s more room in laptop, which in turn means more tech is put in it = more costly.

Oh, now they cost the same .. I think that’s what happened
Size.

Smartphones are very small. The smaller the technology is, traditionally, the more expensive it is.

Laptops stay relatively the same size. They've also been engineered for, for decades. This usually means that the technology for them becomes more economical over time.

Hence phones are expensive while laptops are pretty cheap.
a lot of people buy useless pieces of trash as pc and a useless 1500 dolars phone that has a lot of specs they don't need, so the price looks the same
Phone companies are pushing the pricing line for thier phones (they seem to go up at least a little every gen) and the mass market keeps buying them regardless. Why charge the 400$ its worth when you can charge 3x more and the sheeple still buy.
I don't know shit about this stuff but I think a REAL ELI5 is that idiots buy it.

Even if we add in inflation, how did we go from buying a $600 phone as brand new to $1000+? Because Apple sold it at that price and people bought it.

Same as the Mac bullshit. People are somehow still spending thousands of dollars for a sub-par laptop, some will argue "But the specs ARE good!!!!!!!!!" when in reality you can build a PC that does it's job much better. And if you need the convenience of a laptop I highly doubt you need a $3000 laptop that kinda sorta processes better than others.

There is also the fact that better tech gets more expensive, how much better the tech is today compared to 5 years ago I'm not too sure as I went from an iPhone 4 to a Samsung s5 to my current s7 so I'm a bit behind on all the new fancy stuff. 

And lastly the competition, which is basically what I said above but it unfortunately works against us. You'd think that Apple selling phones for over $1000 would be them shooting themselves in the foot but Samsung goes out and makes a $2000 phone. Apple knows their consumers and the other companies would rather cum money by upping prices than lower them for more customers.

In reality people are just dumb. Nobody needs the new phone with 2x processing power!!!!!!!!!! when all they do is browse facebook in bed or on break. I use Reddit 90% of the time on my phone, the rest is texting, calls, discord or google. Me having my current phone vs the newest most amazing cool fantastic phone won't change my ability to do those things, just like it won't change most peoples abilities to do what they do, but hey I guess being laughed at for having an old phone is something people are genuinely afraid of.
Apple made an inferior product that cost more simply because of its brand name and people actually bought it. Over and over again. Other companies noticed and felt confident that they can pad their margins even more and people will still buy and they did. Rinse and repeat and here we are today
Laptops are computers are tablets are mp3 players are gaming consoles are movie players are TVs...Technology has and continues to emulate and become itself and merge onto itself. Almost all modern tech that the public has access to is redundant now. Having a smartphone is basically having all public high end tech. Swiss army knife.

Conspiracy theory! Tech that won't be out for public consumption for another 20 years is already developed and functional in a sort of prototype stage (how could this not be true btw)...
This isn’t really new. Phones have been 500-800 for 20years (maybe longer I worked at Best Buy 20years and remember the phone costs) and you could get laptops in the sub 1000. 

You just pay the full cost of the phone now since the cell provider doesn’t subsidize the price. They have also gone up in base cost by a couple hundred on average. The cost of laptops have also gone down a touch so you can get a pretty dang good windows machine for 1k.

So yea we can get a good phone and a aight/good laptop for about the same cost now. 

It’s really due to size. It’s more expensive to build a phone due to size, battery, heat issues. A 1k laptop can use older gear and be large enough to make it much easier to cram everything together.
I’m in tech...I think smartphones democratized tech unlike laptops which weren’t ever useable by the masses due to learning curve and functionality.

Smartphones have apps that simply make daily life insanely more productive. Anybody from child to senior can use it. 

For laptops, few need the top level performance and features of a $4000 laptop.
It's  called market. There are many people willing to buy a smartphone at the same price as laptop.

Seriously, people use them a lot and quality matters
Most communications equipment is usually pretty pricey, but compared to some of the best laptops, phones are still only, like, half as expensive.
It's your basic demand and supply. People are willing to pay high end price for phones. Everyone wants the newest and the latest when it comes to phones

We brought a smartphone to laptop level functionality...  Or minimized a laptop to fit our palm.. those two sort of merged.
In addition to what was already said, miniaturization costs money - laptops can use bulkier components, made using less advanced techniques, and they're also less constrained on power (i.e. they don't need the most advanced, power-efficient components to get a day's worth of battery life out of a tiny battery).

The CPUs in phones are also insanely powerful - high-end phones can have more powerful CPUs than most laptops. [This site even claims](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apples-a12-bionic-comes-close-to-desktop-cpu-performance-in-benchmarks) "very small margins until Apple's mobile SoCs outperform the fastest desktop CPUs in terms of ST performance" (I assume ST means single-thread, i.e. the desktop CPU isn't much faster if there's only one thing to do, but can likely do more things at the same time if there are enough things to do).
If explaining to a five year old - it's because laptops and smartphones do the SAME thing now.

We live in the Internet age, and both devices can access the Internet and allow us to use Internet apps e.g you can watch Netflix in HD on both, use excel or Google sheets on both, do photo/vidro editing on both.

The apple iPhone x had a processor Stronger than most cheap to midrange laptops.

The Samsung can be connected to the dex and be used as a desktop pc.

The list goes on - they do some things the same and where they differ becomes unique selling points eg. Can't use a laptop to take good quality outdoor pictures vs a mobile phone camera (triple lens), you can't do heavy video editing on a phone vs using a laptop with a dedicated graphics cards and faster processor
While some people have rightly questioned comparing apples to apples, a high end smart phone used to be $400-600 just a few years ago and $200-300 with a 2 year contract. I'm posting this on a Galaxy S6 I obtained in 2014 in just that manner. 

Phone companies have since switched to monthly payment plan pricing models, offering 'free' upgrades every two or three years (these upgrades aren't free of course, you're just perpetually paying an extra $20-30/mo on your bill). 

This has several effects: it makes high-end phones more affordable on a paycheck to paycheck basis, it it subliminally makes it feel lile the phone is affordable because $20 is less than $600, and at some point many people stop paying attention to the specific details of the monthly bill (this is how cable companies get away with dynamic pricing). 

Add all those together with a short planned obsolescence cycle (For most users, something like a Galaxy S4 would suit their needs just fine, but updates to that version of Android are not supported), and you've got inflated demand. This in turn drives prices higher.
I paid 2000$ for my laptop and 200$ for my phone, both Aple products, you might consider that I have my priorities in order xD
How much are you paying for your phones, I've paid $300 for my phone and $1000+ for my laptop.
I think there’s a stigma or lack of confidence/understanding with older people around computers that they don’t have with smartphones. I work for an auction house and we require photos from people who want to consign with us. A lot of those people are older and when we ask them to email photos they say “oh I don’t do computers” but they are (sometimes) perfectly willing to text photos. 

Considering that, I think older people are more willing to pay for smartphones than for computers.
Expensive laptops are made for specific tasks. Work or heavy gaming. Expensive phones are made for Instagram and Snapchat (basically). Guess what population of users is more important
I got my phone for the equivalent of £250 or a little under €300. It has a triple cam setup, a pop-up selfie can and an in display optical fingerprint scanner with a 1080p amoled screen and the best mid-range soc available (SD 730) with 6gb ram and 64gb storage. Only Asian smartphone markets really experience real competition. Apple fans have managed to perpetuate an "iPhone or broke" mentality in Western markets. You can get the latest 5g snapdragon 855 for as little as €400 in some Asian countries
It is simple, and has nothing to do with high end and what people are willing to buy.  
  
Lets break down the components of lets say a galaxy A70 (about 375$) and a Acer Aspire 5 (about 350$).  
  
Screen: The A70 has a 393 ppi screen super AMOLED, which is pretty much the latest quality. High contrast, high brightness. The laptop has a 141 ppi led 1080p screen. The laptop screen is old tech, cheap to manufacture, and no touch.  
  
Processor: The a70 has Snapdragon 675 with Adreno 612. Performance wise it measured as good as the Ryzen 3 3200U. But it is smaller, made with the lastest 10nm technology qualcomm has, while the AMD is made on 12nm technology. The Amd is also a 2 core 4 thread CPU while the 675 is 8 cores, so it has more multi tasking abilities.
  
Memory: The laptop has 4GB replaceable memory based on DDR4. The A70 has 6GB of non replaceable memory. While the laptop has some edge here, replacing the memory cost because most of those who buy this laptop, will have to also pay up for memory upgrade. And since the CPU is not replaceable, it isn't going to solve its low performance overall.  
  
Physical: The phone has to be super small and super durable, while the laptop is mostly made of cheap plastics. So the quality of the phone shell and the protective screen, and much higher, and usually cost a lot more.  
  
  
So this is what you have.  
A 375$ phone has higher quality, higher components, which all usually cost more than a similar priced laptop.
When smartphones became capable enough to challenge lower priced laptops. Most modern phone feature sets mostly match what a $1000 laptop can provide and it can do it in the size of a device that fits in your pocket.
"Computers" is a slight misnomer; an abacus is a computer, technically speaking. Computers we use today are classed "microcomputers," as each one is run by a very small chip etched with lots of different wires and electric paths. These computers are constantly computing arithmatic between one value and another using only binary digits: ones and zeros.  0 is 0, 1 is 1, and 2 is 10.

Binary arithmatic is, roughly speaking, the simplest form of math possible. It is also the least efficient at storing information; 256 is represented as 11111111.

As information volume increases, miniturization and computing power are the main factors driving the production cost of electronics. In many ways, they are linked: smaller chips can fit more wires, and more wires often means more math equations done per second. In storage, it means more math and information can be stored. Computer chips are measured by the size of these wires (although it isn't quite exact; they're more like size classes than actual sizes).

The biggest goal of miniturization is to make the previous iteration of the chip smaller and more power efficient whilst maintaining the same or better computing capacity.

This is why phones cost as much as laptops, despite a smaller form factor and lower computing power. Phones use a less powerful chip because it is relatively easier to "shrink;" laptops have more room and thus can have larger chips, as well as things like dedicated graphics chips. The smaller form factor is substituted for power.

This is also ignoring the hellish landscape that is thermal management. Smaller, lower power chips produce less heat: this is why phones don't need fans like laptops do.
The smaller you make things, the more engineering is required to make it. On top of that, more technological advancements are made in the field of smartphones than in laptops (underscreen fingerprint scanners and facial recognition to name a few).
If people stopped buying them and these companies see a slump in sales they will lower the price but as long as people mindlessly buy the same phone from last year for $100 extra Apple, Samsung, etc will continue to do this
A lot of people finance phones but virtually nobody finances a laptop. That allows vendors of high end phones a lot of price flexibility. People aren't very smart when it comes to spending money so they'll happily spend double what they should because the monthly payment seems small.

Pro-tip: if you finance a phone you shouldn't be buying a phone.

Also how is a smart fridge's price the same as a phone? I just bought one this week, and I've been thinking about this...
My guess is demand on laptops is lower than smartphones. People might be willing to spend more on phones and change them more often than laptops. Putting upward pressure on phone price and downward on laptops.
People need the latest, biggest tech so they can use basic social media and basic phone communication. Yet for actual work, people can cope with an old laptop. I don't really get the idea of constantly upgrading your phone but having some crappy laptop that can hardly cope with a small work flow.

People frown upon those who invest a lot in laptops year on year ( with the exception of macbooks in most circumstances). Yet having a 1500$ phone upgrade is not only acceptable, but there is an elitist group of people who looks down on people with old phones or, God forbid, an android.

So really the reason is social statements and apple making a ridiculous profit margin on their phones.
How did we get to the point where people will spend $10,000 for a useless shiny rock to wear on their finger?

Okay let me get this straight 

I’m Wall Street and I

- borrowed a pillow, have to give it back on the 29
- sold the pillow for $100 thinking I can buy it back for $50 before the 29
- reddit bought the pillow I borrowed and now I can only buy it back at $3000
- tomorrow is the 29 and I don’t have $3000
- I’m screwed?
How does buying and selling stocks work?

.

I own an orange factory. I want to raise money for building a new navel orange machine, so I issue orange stock. I make a special orange that you can buy for $1. I issue 1 million oranges, and raise $1 million. You now own an orange for every $1 you gave me.

That's all you get. If you're lucky, I might give you a fraction of how much I make with the new orange machine every year. But you buy the orange share because other people will want it later, when my company is big and successful, and you can try selling the orange share for more than the original dollar.

.

What is short selling?

.

You have 100 of my oranges. I come up to you Monday and say, "If you loan me those 100 oranges, I will give you $2 and your oranges back Friday. You agree, and I go off and sell your oranges for $1 each. I have $100 and owe you $2 and your oranges back. I hope your oranges will be cheaper Friday, and if they are only worth 50 cents, I buy 100 oranges and give you them and $2, and I am $48 richer.

.

What is a short squeeze?

.

Someone saw me make the deal on the oranges, and then immediately sell them. They know I have to have 100 oranges on Friday. So the go buy up all the oranges, and on Friday, when I try to buy oranges, they are standing there with a sign that says "oranges for sale $20." Anyone who wants to sell oranges is selling them there. I have to buy from them for $20 an orange. Now I have lost $1900 dollars buying the oranges back, and still owe the $2. 

.

What is stock manipulation?

.

When I buy the 100 oranges, I go around and talk about how bad oranges are. I tell my friends not to let anyone buy oranges so demand drops. I go on CNBC and talk about how I bit into a nasty orange and threw up. Now oranges are 25 cents. How wonderful... I can buy my 100 oranges for $25, and now my profits are $73!
Hopefully this is helpful. I work in the stock market and my little brother asked me to explain what was going on. Here was my response: 

Let’s say GameStop has 100 shares outstanding currently trading @ $20 per share (so if you own 1 share, you own 1%, 25 shares = 25% and so on) 

That’s it. There are only 100 shares of GameStop. Throughout the day people are constantly buying and selling these shares for one reason or another (that’s why the stock price moves up and down constantly)

Now, typically when you think about making money in the stock market you typically think “buy low, sell high” 📈. In other words, buying Amazon when it was cheap, and now it’s worth 💰 💰 💰. In this case you would be speculating that the stock price of Amazon will go up ⬆️ in the future

- *fun industry term: you are  “bull-ish”*

Here is where the short selling comes into play. 

Let’s pretend You have a hedge fund. Alec’s hedge fund manager looks at GME (GameStop) and says “I think GME is over valued, it really should only be trading at $15 per share, not $20 🤔 “

In this situation, He is speculating that in the near future, the GME stock price will go down (to $15). 

- *another fun industry term; he would be “bear-ish” on GME*

Now since the hedge fund manager thinks GME’s stock price will go down, He is going to try to make money on that guess by short selling (shorting) the stock. 

To short the stock The manager is going to *borrow* some shares from someone else, bob, and sell them at the current market price (which is $20). 

Let’s say he borrows 10 shares (total of only 100 remember) and sells them at the New York stock exchange for $20. He made $200 ($20 x 10 shares)

A while later, GMEs stock price suddenly dips (fun industry term: “down ticks”). It is now trading at $15. 

Alec’s hedge fund manager was right! now don’t forget, we borrowed the shares from somebody else so we have to give those back. Alec’s hedge fund manager goes to the New York stock exchange and buys 10 shares @ $15 and returns those to the lender. 

Alec’s hedge fund made $50 on that trade total (this is called “PnL”).

So the full life cycle: 

- *Borrowed 10 shares from “bob”*
- *Sold 10 @ $20 in the market* 
- *Bought 10 @ $15 in the market*
- *Returned 10 shares to “bob”*

Total profit = (10 x $20) - (10 x $15) 


Okay.... so now onto what is actually happening with GameStop. 

Let’s keep the example the same. GameStop has 100 total shares outstanding. 

Now a bunch of hedge fund managers all think the exact thing that Alec’s hedge fund manager thought  so they all short the stock with the expectation that the price will “downtick” in the future. 

Here’s the thing.... someone on Reddit pointed out that despite the fact that GameStop only has 100 shares available at any given time, there were actually 125 shares on loan to cover short sales. 

I know this part is confusing, which it should be. That doesn’t make sense mathematically. How can you have more shares loaned out than available? I’m going to gloss over those details and just say that it is possible, and does happen on occasion. 

Now when you have a stock that is over shorted like this, you have one major risk, which is called a “gamma/short squeeze” . It does not occur often. 

In a gamma/short squeeze, there are more shares loaned out than available. That is because all of those hedge fund managers thought the price would go down and got greedy and tried to make as much 💰 as possible and over borrowed assuming they would be able to cover it. But, someone pointed that out on Reddit, and was able to get that information to go viral. Now with all of these new people buying the stock, it forced the stock price up, very quickly (supply and demand). 

Just like in the example, these hedge fund managers had to return the shares to the lender... the problem is, the stock price has gone up so much that if they have to “close their position” they’ll lose a fortune. 

- *Example: I sold 10 @ $20 = $200*

Instead of going down; the stock price went up to $400. I have to return the stock to the lender and the only way to do it is to go buy it back. So: 

- *I buy 10 @ $400 = $4,000*

- *PnL = +$200 - $4,000*

instead of making money; I lost $3,800. 

This is basically what is happening with GME on a much bigger scale

Edit 1: 

Lots of people asking about the “loan”. It’s not really a loan in the way that you’re thinking. When you execute an order to sell a share, you are required to Mark it as either “long” or “short”. What this really means is, do you “have” the stock right now in your bank account, or are you “able” to get it easily. So theoretically, everyone could be marking their orders as short sales, assuming the shares are easy to borrow and readily available, except, as the price goes up, people panic and start buying them all up and there aren’t enough to go around. This in turn drives the price up further. Hence the “squeeeeeeeze”

Typical settlement of a trade occurs t+2. In other words, you’re required to deliver the shares you sold short to the counter party within two business days of execution


Edit 2:  

for those asking about option expiration: 


An option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date. 

Think about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount. 

On the other side, you have someone who “writes” the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let’s say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can “exercise” it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they’ll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices
What will happen if the Melvin hedge fund cannot buy back the GME shares?

Can they file for bankruptcy, as an organization? Or should each individual associated with the fund do that?

If they declare bankruptcy, what will happen with all the shareholders who lent them their shares? Will they lose them forever?
I just wanna know what happened with gamestop.

Edit: I've received so many good answers and I thank you all. I've never recieved so many  good answers before.

How does a Hedgefund even 'borrow' 140% of available shares of a company? What does that paperwork look like? How was this part of the events even possible?
Melvin is in 5th grade.

He goes to a school where kids sell different kinds of candy to each other on the playground.

Melvin is friends with an older, bigger kid named Essie-C. He makes sure that all the candy sales on the playground happen fairly. If a kid doesn't pay for the right price for the candy, or if the kid selling the candy just takes the money, Essie-C beats them up. Teachers at the school let this all happen because the kids like candy, they are better behaved when they have it, and Essie-C is generally a pretty trustworthy kid who is feared by the bad kids.

A delicious new candy called Chee'umee has come out, but it's only available in Japan. It's the perfect candy in every way, EXCEPT that many of the batches spoil very easily. The candy is so good though, that people still buy it, even with the possibility that they might end up with spoiled batch. Normally the wrapper of the candy is bright metallic green, but when it spoils, it turns black.

Melvin is friends with Essie-C. One day, Melvin has an idea and pulls Essie-C aside.

Melvin: Hey Essie-C! Have you heard about this new Japanese candy called Chee'umee?

Essie-C: Nope.

Melvin: Well, it's really good and I want to sell it to the kids on the playground, but I don't have any with me. My dad is going on a business trip to Japan next month, and he can bring some back for me. Would it be cool if I sell the other kids IOUs? Then when I get the candy, They can exchange their IOUs for the candy!

Essie-C: OK

Melvin: Well, there's one more thing. The Chee'umee might spoil before the kids get to exchange the IOUs for it. If that happens, is it okay if I keep the money they paid for the IOU? The kids I'm selling to will need to understand that we might get a spoiled batch and their IOUs won't be worth anything.

Essie-C: Sure. But you'd still have to give them the spoiled candy, if they want it.

Melvin: No kid would want the spoiled candy!

Essie-C: Them's the rules.

Melvin: Fine...

On the playground, Melvin follows this plan and sells 140 IOUs, which are little slips of paper to all the kids on the playground. He makes a lot of money that day.

Later that evening, Melvin talks to his dad, Sid Atell, at dinner. Melvin: Dad, when you go to Japan, do you think you could bring back some of that Chee'umee candy?

Sid: Sure, son! How much do you need?

Melvin: Well, I was hoping for... 140 pieces?

Sid: Goodness, son! That's a lot! I don't think I can bring that much back. I can bring back, oh about 20 pieces. Would that be okay?

Melvin: Sure I guess. Here's the money for the 20 pieces.

Melvin figures he will just tell the 120 kids that their candy got spoiled on the trip back from Japan. But this is great for Melvin, because he only had to pay his dad for 20 pieces of Chee'umee!

A month later, his dad returns from his trip to Japan with 20 pieces of candy, and all but 5 turned black. Melvin takes all the candy to the playground and exchanges all 5 of the shiny green metallic candies for IOUs. The 5 kids who got the green candies are excited and the candy is as delicious as advertised. The other kids are quite annoyed that so much of the candy spoiled. 

3 kids, Wally, Sam and Betty, are a little suspicious of Melvin, so they ask for their candies anyway. Melvin hands it over.

Wally, Sam and Betty open the candy and eat it. To their amazement, the candy is just as good! Better, even! The wrapper just turned black, but the candy itself is just fine! Wally, Sam and Betty tell all the kids on the playground to use their IOUs and get the candy even if it's in a black wrapper.

Melvin is now in a tough spot. He goes to Essie-C for help, but Essie-C reminds him of the deal. All IOUs have to be exchanged, if the kid wants their black-wrapped candy.

As a last ditch effort, Melvin goes to the playground teacher, Mrs. Robin Hood to tell her of his predicament. All these kids have IOUs and they really want the candy, but he can't give it to them.

Cleaned up some grammar.
What happens if you fail to return the borrowed stocks? Like you sold the borrowed stocks but everyone else bought it and now there are no stocks to purchase. What then?

Also how do you *borrow* stocks? If you sold it then doesn't the stock's ownership change?
[removed]
[removed]
Isn't what happened with GameStop (and other company stock such as Nokia) exactly the sort of risk that is inherent in hedge funds? Aren't hedge funds typically supposed to be rich enough to just eat the loss and move on?

What makes this particular issue such big news?
My question would be: why would certain people want to lend out their stocks of GME? I thought it was pretty clear that gamestop was failling. 

Why would they want to keep a stock they know is going down. (Pre wsb)
Why is the "shorting" of a company necessary, or even legal? Wouldn't the top elitists just manipulate the market and cause the failing company to get smashed into oblivion, ergo gaining more money from it? How is this beneficial for anyone but the top investors? Is the system rigged?
Easy way to think about it...

You have 100 shares of company G stock that currently sells at $100.  Your friend thinks the price will drop to $50 in one week, so he borrows your 100 shares with the contractual guarantee to return the shares back to you in a week.

He immediately sells those shares for $100.  Now neither of you own those shares. But your friend still owes you the shares, so he’ll just buy it back from the market in a week when it drops to $50, return the shares to you and pocket a $5000 profit.

Only, the stock price doesn’t drop, it goes up.  To $200.  Your friend owes you 100 shares of stock, so he has to buy it from the market for $200.  He return the stocks to you and has lost $10000.  

Now bump the numbers up.  Assume there are 1 million shares of the stock available, so he makes agreements to borrow all 1 million from the owners, yet somehow also manage to borrow about 500,000 shares that simply don’t exist.  But since it’s a contract to borrow shares, it doesn’t matter...they’re just paper shares, and he’ll make a fortune when the stock drops.  Except the share price doesn’t drop, and he owes people 1.5 million shares, but there are only 1 million shares on the entire market.  So not only does he need to buy 1m shares at the new inflated price, he’s also got to somehow but 500,000 shares that are nonexistent.  So in order to pay back those borrowed shares, he needs to buy them back from other owners, who are more than happy to sell them back to him at an even higher price than the day before.  In short, the attempt to buy back all those shares that he owes but that don’t exist only pushes the price of the stock higher and higher and the losses just keep growing and growing.

If Melvin hadn’t gotten greedy and dumb and bought sell options that exceeded the number of shares in the market, they might have taken a big loss, but now they’re caught in a self-inflicted feedback loop where their losses only keep growing more and more as they try to fill their obligation to pay back all the shares that they owe.

This is why derivatives (assets “derived” from the value of actual assets) can be such dangerous bets...they basically were created to hedge risk, but Wall Street traders tend to just treat it like gambling.  And...they not only gamble with the money, they borrow tons of it issuing the investment as collateral...and gamble with that.  They think it’s an easy bet, so borrowing isn’t a big deal...unless they miscalculate the risk, which is how it can all blow up in their face.  Which is exactly what happened in 2008.  They had $100, decided to bet it all on black at roulette...but though the chance of red coming up was <1% so they borrowed another $9,900
 to put on black.  A dumb bet because they didn’t properly determine the risk of the bet.
Lets start with a baseline: there is a city, and in that city people are **trading apples**.


>How does buying and selling stocks work?

If you want to buy an apple, you can walk up to a shop (a middle man, a broker) and ask them to buy an apple. The shop owner then gets apples from the farm or from someone else and sells them to you at the price that is agreed upon. If you want to sell an apple, you can set a price or agree to a price that the shop owner wants to buy your apples at.

If more people want apples, the price goes up, as there is more demand and fewer apples. The sellers can ask more money.
If less people want apples, the price goes down because they might be stinky apples no one wants.

>What is short selling?

You have an apple. Its worth $10 in your city. I walk up to you, and I tell you, let me borrow your apple. I will pay 1$ to lend it for every week I have it. You agree. 
As soon as I get it, I sell it for $10. I now have money and no apples. One week later, the price of apples goes down to $5. I buy an apple at $5 and give you your apple back. I've made $4 profit (since I paid $1 to borrow it). I have shorted apples. I have made money on the price of apples going down.

If the price went up instead, and I was wrong, I lose money when I have to buy the apple back to give back to you.

>What is a short squeeze?

If tons of people in my city are shorting apples, but the price actually goes up (I was wrong) they are in trouble! The price could technically keep rising and their risk is infinite.
Now if demand goes up, and people suddenly LOVE apples, those people that shorted get really really nervous. The higher it goes, the more it costs to buy back the apple (cover). 
When the first person that shorts breaks, and buys back apples, the demand raises, and the prices goes even higher!
Now suddenly shorters are racing for who can buy back first, making the price explode like a bomb.


>What is stock manipulation?

People doing funky things with apples to wrongly give the illusion the apples are worth less. For example, they can lend out apples that they just borrowed from someone else, or say that there is a worm infestation when really there is not. Or they can close apple shops altogether, which would be really bad and illegal.

>What is a hedge fund?

Its like an apple king in your city, they have a lot of apples and/or move a lot of apples, making a lot of money in doing so. They have a lot of power to influence the price of apples to their benefit.
Ok, i'll try my best to explain. Buckle up. this is going to be long. There is no ELI5 Version.

Buying and selling stock is done through a stock exchange via a broker (Interactive brokers, E-trade, robinhood, etc...)  If I wanted to buy let say 10 shares of apple. I would place a bid at let's say $100 per share so I would need $1000 Capital. You put this request in and once it's accepted you now own 10 shares of apple. 2 years down the road, I want to sell my apple stock which is now worth 200/share. I will simply place the bid at $200 for my $10 shares and gain a profit of $1000 (2000-1000 initial investment). 

SHORTING: Now brokers usually have settings that enable users to OPT -IN (Default Setting)/ OPT OUT for lending your shares to others. So using my example of apple shares. If I OPTED IN - a hedge funds, an institution  can "Borrow" my 10 shares to sell to other people and pay back lets say in a week or so.

**NOTE: THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY BORROW THE STOCK, BUT IT IS DONE THROUGH THE BACKDOOR- MOSTLY NAKED SHORTING AND BROKER MARKS IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER THAT JOHN SHORTED 10 APPLE STOCKS. TYPICALLY YOU SHORT ABOUT 20% OF A STOCK AND THAT IS A LOT AS WELL, ANYTHING HIGHER WILL GET YOU IN DEEP TROUBLE IF THE PRICE MOVES AGAINST YOU. YOU NEED A LOT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO DO THIS AS IT IS VERY RISKY. GAMESTOP WAS SHORTED 140% FLOAT, which means they shorted more than the available numbers of shares on the market (100%). THEY CAN'T BUY BACK ALL THE SHARES AND HAVE CORNERED THEMSELVES.**

Why would someone do this you may ask? This is so they can sell the shares of apple continuously to drive the price of the stock down and cause panic and selling event, then come in later to scoop up the shares at dirt cheap prices and pay off the borrowed shares. 

Continuing our example, lets say 1 week later, Apple is now trading at $50/share. Well the Hedge fund now can return my 10 shares, but it only cost them $500 instead of $1000. So they made a profit of $500. They can do this as many times as they want and will make money AS LONG AS THE PRICE GOES DOWN. **what about if the price goes up**? **This is where RISK MANAGEMENT comes into play. Theoretically, their loss is INFINITE, which is what we are witnessing as GameStop stock price keeps going up and they are adamant in lowering it.** 

**Now lets switch gears and dive into GameStop. As mentioned previously, it was shorted 140%. The people on Wallstreetbets found this out and recommended that hey, take a look at this, this isn't right, the company isn't doing bad. The recent sales of PS5 consoles went great, I think GameStop has potential and is undervalued. I'm not telling you to buy the stock, but hey this is where it could go. THIS CAUGHT ON FIRE and everyone bought GameStop shares only because "It's a good company, and we like this stock"** 

This is where it gets interesting. Now our old friend JOHN who shorted the apple stock, also shorted 140% of GameStop. How do you close your short position? You have to buy back the stock. Well the stock went up. So John has to buy at the higher price in order to close his position, but remember he can't close all of his position because there is not enough available shares for him to buy back. Also his loss is infinite because the price can theoretically go to infinity, If John had a million dollar short position, he's not on the hook for more than a million, he's on the hook infinite amount technically. **THIS IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH WE ARE WITNESSING.**

SHORT SQUEEZE: 

Our Friend JOHN can choose to close his position only if the shareholder of GameStop agrees to sell to JOHN. If someone agrees to sell to JOHN at $100, then great he can close some of his positions, but what if they refuse? John must go to the next seller at $200 and buy the stock at $200/share. What if they refused? Next person at $300 and so on and so forth until he can close all of his position. This is where the price is being squeezed higher and higher by buyers refusing to sell their stock of gamestop.

I could type more, but I'll stop here.

THE RICH GOT CAUGHT WITH THEIR PANTS DOWN AND THEY ARE ON THE HOOK for BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE AVERAGE JOE LIKE YOU AND ME.
 

For people that don’t understand **shorting**; here is my best explanation at it (this is heavily inspired by a YouTube video)…

**Shorting is when you think a company is going to do badly so you borrow that company stock from a broker and promise to pay them back later.**

Here is a Non-Stock Example:

Imagine that you thought **apples were going to go down in value** and they currently cost **$1.**

You go to a shop keeper and ask if you can borrow an apple which you will give back later.

You borrow the apple from him and sell it someone for $1 and then wait for the price to change. If the price goes down to 50 cents then you can buy 2 apples for a dollar. You go back to the shopkeeper and give him back the apple.

**He has an apple back and you have an extra 50 cents.**

**In stock market terms you have shorted them apples**. Now replace the apples with stocks and you hopefully get the idea.

2 other things worth mentioning about short positions f**irst you have to pay an interest rate** **on your short positions** because you're borrowing something.

Secondly, **short positions can be greater than 100% of stock.**

**Let’s get to GME**

GME is a brick and mortar video game company, after Covid hit Gamestop **unsurprisingly** has a couple of bad months and revenue falls. GME falls to about $4 per share.

Largely because of this many **big international investors essentially thought Gamestop was going to go bust and therefore shorted GME.**

Hoping to see it collapse, they didn’t see that there was some good news coming Gamestop’s way.

Firstly in **Mid August our saviour Ryan Cohen started buying GME shares.** By December Cohens company had bought about 9 million share (13% GME).

Then in January Cohen and some other CEOs were appointed to Gamestop’s board.

This gave Gamestop a huge advantage as **now they’ve got a billionaire investor who’s experienced with running ecommerce companies** which is exactly the business model Gamestop needs to shift to.

Secondly in **November PS5 and Xbox series X was released starting a new console cycle** which is good news for Gamestop.

Thirdly Gamestop **signed a deal with Microsoft which gave them a share of all of Xbox’s digital revenues**

So, what happened to the stock?

Firstly, the institutions that were shorting GME bought more short positions to try to supress the stock price.

This chart shows that for example on January 11th **there are massive 4 million short positions** taken despite the fact that this was the day Cohens board appointments were announced.

📷

In total 71 million short positions were taken even though Gamestop only had a float of 69.75 million shares. Remember you can have more short positions that actual shares.

This gets crazier because about 20% of Gamestop shares is held by insiders like Cohen. Insiders can’t sell easily because of regulations.

📷

There is the same amount again owned by big institutions who don’t normally trade either.

📷

**So that leaves between 20 to 30 million actively traded stocks and 71 million short positions who all need to buy stock**

That is a lot of demand and not much supply. Wallstreet Bets realized this and determined that if they bought the stock and **held** they could force the price up which triggers a **short squeeze.**

Where people with short positions desperately buy into a stock and try to cover before the price gets too high. These people are losing money but covering now prevents them from bigger losses.

**However because there isn’t enough stocks to go around the price of each stock jumps spectacularly**.

Remember it costs money to shorter position forever because of interest **so they want to act fast** which is exactly what happened to Volkswagen in 2008. Where it breifly became the most expensive stock in history. **Which is exactly what is happening with GME right now!**

📷

Ulitmatly Redditors made big money and **if you hold for longer you will make more.**

The 2 big short sellers who lost big money is **Melvin Capital and Citeron Resarch.**

**You can tell that they are panicking because 2 days ago Melvin Capital had to be bailed out by 2 big insitutions which isnt good for them.**

**There is a lot of short postions to be covered if you hold for longer the price for each stock will increase.**

Secondly if you've seen anything about this in the news it's often spun as mental reddit investors ruin the market **there's three things worth saying here**:

Firstly, wall street bets doesn't actually **hold much sway over the market itself as WSB is an internet forum not an institution**.

Secondly, it's not as if the market was rational **beforehand it's just that only hedge funds used to be able to manipulate** it and this wasn't even clear manipulation obviously some of GME's rise is a function of speculation but there's a good argument that it was undervalued and over shorted to begin with.

Thirdly it's fundamentally a good thing that people are able to get into the stock market and make **money off GME as it might make things more volatile and harder for hedge funds.**

But fuck Wall Street.

tl;dr: Melvin Capital and other big short shellers were caught with their dick in the cookie jar when they overshorted GME making GME shares go to the fucking moon. If you hold GME you could be able to go to fucking Alpha Centuri and bankrupt big short shellers
GameStop explained - 
Remember the toilet paper shortage we went through? 
GameStop is the toilet paper. 
Melvin Capital is the price gouger who borrowed a bunch of TP from Charmin (broker) at “future” normal post-pandemic prices ($1) and sold it to the public at current prices ($5). 
Pandemic over, Melvin has to return TP to Charmin buuuuut Reddit decided Melvin bad and toilet paper good and bought all the TP forcing Melvin to buy it from them for new price of $50 or pay Charmin extra for collateral. 
Melvin’s friends got mad that Reddit acted like Melvin and they closed Charmin’s doors so Reddit couldn’t buy anymore TP. 
Now AOC and Trump Jr have joined forces and are having lunch discussing ways to punish Melvin’s friends so that Reddit can put all the toilet paper in a rocket ship.
Can a professional explain, how is lender being paid by the borrower for borrowing the stock?
Right, let's see if I can explain this. Obligatory am not a stock broker, so please take what I say with a grain of salt, and I definitely welcome any corrections for things I get wrong.

##Stocks and Shares

Let's say you have a company called CORP, and that company has a board of directors. Now CORP wants to become publicly traded, so they announce that they will sell one seat on the board for $20. Alice hears of this and thinks that's a pretty good deal, so pays them the money and now gets a small say in what the company does and in return CORP gets a little bit of extra money. This seat is a **share** in the company, which can be traded in something called the **stock market** (where people can buy and sell their stock in a company). 

Now as the years go on, CORP becomes a global company and now everyone wants to be at the table. Suddenly Alice's seat becomes really valuable. If Alice wants she can sell her seat for $100 now, or keep her seat and hope that CORP does better and sell it for more later on. Even though right now Alice doesn't have any more money in her wallet than she did originally, she is still worth more money because the seat she owns is now worth more. 

Importantly, when Alice does sell her seat, even if she sells it for $1000, CORP doesn't actually get any of that money - they already sold the seat to Alice a long time ago for $20. However, later on CORP might apply for a loan, and the broker might look at the price of the seats at their table (their **share price**). If the price is really high, that must mean the company is doing well for themselves so the loan is more likely to be approved. Also, if anyone ever owns more than half of the seats at the table, then that person also effectively owns CORP. So CORP really wants the price of their seats to stay high. 

##Short Selling

So what if CORP starts doing poorly? Well Bob 'Shorty' McScrooge might see this and see an opportunity to make money off of CORP's losses. So what he does is he goes to Alice and asks her if he can borrow her seat. She reluctantly says yes, as long has he promises to give it back in a month. He takes this seat and sells it to Joe for $100. As the days pass, the price of a seat at CORP goes down. When the end of the month comes around, Shorty buys another seat back, but now that the price has gone down he only has to pay $20 (meaning he effectively made $80 since he originally sold the seat for $100). 

Let's say now that after Shorty borrowed Alice's seat and sold it, CORP finds gold and now everyone wants to buy a seat again. Well now Shorty is in real trouble. At the end of the month, he still owes Alice her seat back, but now seats cost $1000 to buy. If Shorty can't find a way to make the seats cheap again, then he might go bankrupt.

## GameStop

This is pretty much what happened with GameStop (aka GME). They were doing really poorly and their share price was going down, so lots of billionaires borrowed stock (seats) and sold them, expecting the price to drop resulting in them making even more money at the cost of GME. Reddit realised this so bought all the stocks causing the price to soar, meaning the billionaires are going to have to spend lots of money to buy back their borrowed seats (costing them billions of dollars). Of course, losing billions of dollars is something billionaires would very much like to avoid. 


##  Robinhood App

Robinhood is an app used by a lot of everyday people to trade stocks, and was the tool used by a lot of redditors to make GME's share price get so high. No matter what the billionaires did, more and more redditors started using Robinhood to buy more GME stock, causing the prices to get even higher (meaning the billionaires would have to pay *even more* to return their borrowed seats). So to try to drive the price down, Robinhood said it would no longer let people buy GME stock, and that they could only sell now (remember, the seats at the table are only worth something if people are able to buy them). This is illegal and has been widely criticised by US representatives from both parties as well as basically everyone who isn't a billionaire.

EDIT: Added Robinhood section

EDIT 2: Formatting and typos
What is keeping a hedge fund that shorted GME from just waiting until this bubble pops? What is how does this short squeeze force the hedge funds to pay billions today if soon this will all be over?
[removed]
Does anyone know the first post that called for buying GameStop? Just curious for some historical perspective on how this all started.
Here's my explanation that I told to a friend.

There's a way called "shorting" to profit off of dying companies.

(Consider + as profit and - as loss)

Short Procedure:
1. Borrow a stock that is expected to drop. ( - small borrow fee)
2. Sell it for current price. ( +Original stock price)
3. Wait for it to drop.
4. Buy it back much cheaper. ( -dropped price)
5. Then return the stock to the owner.
Total Profit = original stock price - dropped price - borrow fee

 Risk: If the company's stock rises instead of falling, you will sustain losses.
 Loss = Inflated Price + Borrow Fee - Original Price.
 This is hence considered a risky practice.
 
Back to the story,
In lockdown GameStop was suffering major losses and it's stocks were dropping, so many big businesses and a large number of people decided to short it.

If you look back at the short procedure, there's a long waiting period.

The status at this waiting period is that you owe the original owner one stock. (The stock you borrowed and then sold and are now waiting for it's price to drop)

Now suppose another person wants to short GameStop.
This person may borrow the stock that you just sold, from the person that you just sold it to. (In other words, this person will borrow one stock from the person who brought one stock from you).

Notice the problem here.
There only one stock, but there are two people who owe someone that stock.
In other words, two people think they own a stock but there's only one stock available to own.
Soon, there will be more people who owe a stock to someone, than the total stocks that are there.

This happened to GameStop, where 140% of it's stocks were sold as short. But there's not enough stocks for this many people to own.

Now imagine the stock price goes up instead of down, (say the company did something great), people will panic and try to buy back the stocks they sold so as to not sustain losses. (Why do they buy back? Because they need to return the stock to the owner.)
But there are not enough stocks to go around. This will increase the demand of stocks and supply will be short, further increasing it's price, this cycle will continue and the stock price will keep on increasing because of the high demand and low supply. Note that this didn't happen yet.

(Btw why are there not enough stocks? Imagine the story earlier, after noticing the rise in price, you decide to buy back the stock, but instead of asking the person you sold to, you ask the person currently owning the stock, now you return the stock to the original owner and you're relieved, but what about the person you sold the stock to the first time? There was only one stock which has returned to it's owner, there's still one guy who owes someone a stock and one guy who thinks he owns one stock.)

Now comes reddit,

Note: If many people buy a particular stock, it's price will increase because of the increased demand and shortened supply.

The small investors on r/wallstreetbets decided to take advantage by buying GameStop's stocks and increasing the stock price, this will start the chain I explained just now, where the people who have shorted will buy back to avoid losses, but due to the lack of stocks, it's price will further increase, and more people will pull out of the short and the price will increase again, and so on.

Before lockdown, the stock price was $4 apiece. Recently it reached $147, and one day later $345. The price is skyrocketing.

The big investors and billionaires that decided to short and take advantage are losing money in billions, while the small investors are making loads of money.

But GameStop is not as valuable as it's stock price, so this inflating bubble will burst, and the prices will crash.
When this happens, if you invest by looking at the rising prices,  you will lose a lot of money, but you can profit if you short at the correct time.

Sigh.
This is about more than personal profit at this point. If you want to actually make a tangible difference in the system then buy and hold AMC, GME, or NOK. I won't lie, you may lose your money but it's about sending a message and making them hurt. If you have the money to spare and want to make a billionaire cry then buy.
Here's something that was never 100% clear to me- what's the actual process that takes place when a share is purchased or sold that makes the price go up/down? For example, John owns a single share of Random Company, currently being traded at 100 dollars a share. John decides to cash in and sell his share. He would then approach the stock exchange where the trading takes place (well, his broker in real life, but whatever), and state that he owns a single share of Random Company and would like to sell it for $100.
The end result of that is John gets $100, and the price ticks ever so slightly down. 
My question is concerned with why does it go down, and who/what decides that. The economic mechanism of supply/demand is clear to me, but since this isn't really a marketplace where bartering can take place, it's not like  potential sellers would see that John has just sold his share and would therefore adjust their offered price- it all happens independently from the traders.

So what happens there? Does the stock exchange's algorithm adjust the price because more shares are now available for purchase? Something else?
GME just went up 61% after hour tonight. 

How come it is legal for brokerage firms to block customers from buying a certain stock but big investors like the said brokerage firms can buy in after hours after they manipulated the price by removing demands during the day? 

As a retail customer, how can I trade after hour?
Imagine you have a warehouse of bikes.

Now, I have a buyer that wants to buy a bike for $300, but I think that next week there will be a big discount and I can go buy a new bike for $100. I ask you if I can borrow a bike to sell to the buyer and you agree, so long as I can replace that bike in a week. I sell your bike and wait for the next week. Sure enough, the discount kicks in, I buy a new bike, and give it to you + a small fee for borrowing it. I make money and you have your bike plus the fee. That’s a short-sell.

But what if instead nobody is selling any bikes next week? The price goes WAY up because everybody who short sold NEEDS to buy. That’s a short squeeze.
Does the massive increase in stock price benefit GameStop, the actual company, in any way?  Like they’ve obviously been struggling for a while, does this fiasco actually help them stay afloat, or is the health of a company completely disparate the price of its stock?

The only part I’m confused about is why hedge fund bros and actual Wall Street professionals think what WSB did was illegal or criminal? Why did Robinhood suspend all trading? Didn’t WSB play by the rules of the game, even if they screwed over some powerful people? 

Edit: added last question
People are saying these Wall Street guys have been manipulating the market for years, can someone explain this? What did they do and how?
Message I wrote for a friend explaining the situation:

on reddit, about 2 million people saw an exploit they could use in the stock market, the exploit was this:

as a hedge fund, (businesses with billions of dollars), their job is to short the market, (see if a stock is going to drop, then if they think it will, they bet on it and if it drops they make a ton of money, but if it goes up, they have to pay the dividends.) For example, if Tesla is at $500 per share (stock), they could bet it’s gonna drop to $400. If it does they make money, if not, let’s say it goes up to $600, and they bought 10 shares, they have to pay ~5,000 ish dollars, because they bought ten shares and it went up. Their job is to do the opposite of investors, so they try to bet the market will go down instead of up.

Anyways, people on r/wallstreetbets saw that hedge funds were betting that GME (gamestop) would short, (go down). So, they decided to get all 2 million people on that subreddit to join them in buying GME stocks. The idea is, if you buy a stock, the price goes up super slightly, and if millions of ppl buy a bunch of stocks, the price per stock will skyrocket.

So, WSB (r/wallstreetbets) did exactly this. GME was valued at $27 per share, and hedge funds began to bet that GME would short, so, WSB bough a TON of GME stocks, and forced the stock to skyrocket. GME hit $500 per share last night, meaning that multiple hedge funds had to pay BILLIONS of dollars. 

All of this happening, and people are becoming millionaires everywhere. If you bough ONE share of GME at $27, and sold at the peak, ($500), you would’ve made ~$441 profit, but people bough hundreds of thousands of shares, so they made millions.

This means hedge funds went bankrupt. The rich people lost all their money, and the poor became rich. For the retards on snapchat, this is where the story ends, but there’s a lot more to it. 

Super powerful people saw this, and didn’t like they were losing money, so, they got in bed with brokerages, and made them get rid of the “buy” option for GME and a couple other stocks. Meaning that they took away everyone’s power of their own money, just because they lost some of theirs. GME crashed today, but there was no volume behind it, meaning that nobody sold, so there is no reason it should’ve crashed. This means that somebody powerful manipulated the market and made it crash, which is EXTREMELY illegal. 

So, WSB are the actual good guys here, and the government, along with many billionaires are in deep shit for removing the people’s freedom of finance and manipulation of the market, which basically means they toyed with peoples money.

Edit: I just want to clarify, I am in NO WAY an expert. Some of this may be inaccurate, this is just my take, and how I explained it to someone who didn’t even know what a stock was. Take it with a grain of salt.

Does any of this mean anything for me? (the common person who knows nothing about any of this)
>How does buying and selling stocks work?

Buying and selling stocks is quite simple. A stock in a company has a certain price. The more people who buy that stock, the value of the stock goes up. Demand is increased, so price goes up. Conversely, if a lot of people sell a certain stock, the price goes down.

>What is short selling?

Short selling is what you can do if you think the value of a stock is going to decrease. Here's how it works. Let's say you think stock XYZ is going to decrease in price within one month. You, through your broker, can short sell it. When you short sell, you "borrow" a certain number of stocks from someone who holds them. Let's say you borrow 100 shares of XYZ at $100 per share with a total value of $10,000. Once you borrow them, you sell them at $100 per share for $10,000. If a month later the price of XYZ goes down, let's say to $50 per share, all you need to do is buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share for $5000 and give it back to the person you borrowed from (minus a small principle). You get to keep the difference between the price you sold it for ($10,000) and the price you bought it for ($5000), which is $5000.

However, if the price of the stock does not decrease, you are still required to return the same number of shares you borrowed. Let's say XYZ doesn't decrease in value but jumps from $100 per share to $150 per share. By the end of the month, you are required to buy 100 XYZ shares for $15,000 in order to return them (minus the principle you owe). You have now lost $5000 in your short sale because the stock increased in value.

>What is a short squeeze?

A short squeeze is when the price of a stock is driven up (by purchasing the stock) in order to cause people who short sold the stock to lose money. The most popular short squeeze at this moment is GameStop or GME. A bunch of hedge fund managers short sold GME, which was trading at ~$20 per share at the beginning of the year, anticipating that it would drop in value. People at r/WallStreetBets saw this and decided to coordinate to buy GME and drive the price up. Currently, GME is trading for $350 per share. That means people who shorted GME at $20 per share, must now pay 17.5x what they borrowed in order to return the shares to whomever they borrowed them from.

>What is stock manipulation?

By definition, "Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain." You could argue that what r/WSB has done is market manipulation, as they have driven up the price of a stock (GME) that has nothing to do with the value of the company or any natural market forces. Conversely, you could also argue that what Robin Hood did when they banned users from purchasing GME was market manipulation, as they took actions that affected the price of a stock regardless of what the market was indicating.

>What is a hedge fund

A [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102113/what-are-hedge-funds.asp) is "a limited partnership of investors that uses high risk methods, such as investing with borrowed money, in hopes of realizing large capital gains." It's basically a bunch of investors using money that is not theirs in order to make money in the stock market." It's basically a bunch of people getting together, pooling their money and telling a fund manager, "You can trade with this money we've pooled together to either go long if you think the market will rise or short if you think the market will go down."
[deleted]
For the people or institutions who "lend" their stock shares to short sellers, what's the incentive? I understand that the stock lenders are paid interest until they get their stocks back, but if they know that the short seller's goal is to have the stock drop in value wouldn't the lenders be losing money on the stock price when they get the devalued shares back?
How does one short a company by 120%? That sounds to me to be 20% more than what is possible. And 10% more than what football coaches think is possible.

How do you know when stocks are being shorted?
All these specific eli5 questions and here I am just looking for the general "eli5 what the hell has happened?" lol
Is Gamestop benefitting from this situation?
I'm learning more about economics just reading this thread than I learned in the year I took economics at school.
Is it legal for Robinhood to block trading of Gamestop stock?
I just hear about the class action lawsuit 

But can/shouldn't Game Stop/GME sue Robinhood and the others too? 

I mean they have biggest damage from getting their stocks frozen/manipulated, right?
How did anyone know that over 100% of GME was shorted in the first place? Is this just public information?
This was posted in another thread: 
I’m just going to paste the answer I’ve been giving:

Short selling involves borrowing a stock from someone who owns it with the promise to return it at a later date, and pay a small fee based on the value of the stock. You then sell the stock, wait for the price to drop and buy it back at a cheaper price. You then return the stock to the original owner and pocket the difference.

This allows people to make money off of a drop in the price of a stock. Unlike with regular stock trading, however, the potential losses of you are wrong are not limited. If you buy a $10 share in a company and the company goes bankrupt, you lose $10. If you short a company with a $10 share price, and that price jumps to $100 per share, you just lost $90.

Since the start of the pandemic, GameStop has clearly been struggling in a big way. Such a big way, that a lot of people, including major hedge funds, decided to short GameStop. A lot.

Let’s say I own a share of GameStop stock and you want to short it. I lend you my share, and you sell it. Now someone else wants to short the stock as well, so they borrow the share from the person you sold it to and then they sell it. And so on. If this happens enough times, you can have more people who owe back a share to the “original” owner than there are actual shares of the stock.

This happened to GameStop which had 140% of its share sold short. This presents a problem for short sellers if the price of the stock starts going up instead of down, because there aren’t enough shares to go around if they decide they all need to cut their losses and buy back the shares they owe at once.

Some smaller investors, including those at r/wallstreetbets, noticed this happening to GameStop’s stock and decided to take advantage. They bought up a bunch of shares themselves, driving the price up and further limiting the availability of shares. This caused some short sellers to pull out, which drove the price up further, which caused more short sellers to pull out, and so on.

Meanwhile, the attention brought to this story and the quickly rising share price caused more people to buy the stock in the hope of taking advantage of the meteoric rise in price to make money themselves.

Back in the summer, you could buy a share for $4 apiece. Yesterday, those same shares were $147 each. Today they’re $345. The big hedge funds that were selling the stock short are currently literally billions in the hole while the smaller investors are making money hand over fist.

That all said, GameStop is still a struggling company underneath it all. It is nowhere near as valuable as its current share price, which means that, eventually, the bubble is going to burst and the price is going to come crashing back down. Anyone who buys in at the top expecting it to keep shooting up is going to lose a ton of money. Anyone still shorting it at that time is going to make a ton of money, and anyone who bought it early and sells before it pops is going to make a ton of money.

It’s not entirely clear whether the hedge funds are going to wind up actually losing billions in the end or if they can recoup some of that when the bubble bursts (they may or may not come out ok), but there are definitely going to be a bunch of people currently riding the hype train who lose whatever they invest at this point.
Short squeezes in a nutshell:

Imagine you want to make some quick money. Your dad is on vacation for a few months and you decide to sell his stash of gold for $1,000,000. You have a hunch that the price of gold will be going down, so you can just buy the same amount of gold for $800,000 later and pocket the rest.

But instead of the price of gold going down, it goes up- way up. Before you know it, you're forced to sell many of your belongings just to buy back the gold for $1,200,000. You can't bear the risk to wait any longer- if the price continues to go up you could lose your house! And you *have* to buy it back at some point.

This is pretty much a short squeeze. Just rather than "borrowing" gold from your father, you borrow stocks for stockholders. And as the price goes up, you eventually are forced to buy at an inflated price or else risk losing everything.
[removed]
Another thing needed to answered is what a gamma squeeze is. I’m too drunk to fully write it out but it’s something that needs to be addressed because the shorts have hardly covered, if at all. Which means the short squeeze is still in play
How does after-hours trading work? I mean, I see the price (I'm watching GME like everyone else) changing, but if the price can change them what's the point of declaring the market closed? 

If you really aren't buying and selling during the night, and instead are promising to buy and sell later, how does that work with a volitile price like this one? If I try to buy a share right now at say $300, do I actually own a share or does it only "happen" when the market opens? And if so, how do price changes between my purchase and the market opening get recognized?

It's all too confusing for my tiny brain.
Why does someone lend his stock to a short seller? Does he gain anything? Sounds like you just end up with less bang for your bucks
What are stocks and what do they do?? Also what are shareholders? Hedges?? I don't get economics at all
Relating to the GameStop scenario, a lot of people here have explained why these large corporations are losing a lot of money by shorting the GME stock and expecting the value to drop before they buy the shares back to return to the original owner. 

My question is: who are they borrowing from? Are they just stockholders who has shares of GME in the first place? What of they don't want to lend it, do they have an option of saying no? I'm confused what's in it for the people lending these mega corporations shares if they aren't the ones making money by loaning out their shares. 

I'm new to this so forgive me if I'm not asking the right thing here.
[removed]
What is short selling and why did/does it work in the first place? I saw some explanations but I still don’t get it. If you sell something you own, it drops, then you buy again doesn’t that mean you lose value?
Will this have any effect on regular people?
ELI5: What's preventing hedge funds from buying shorts at the current (possibly?) inflated prices, and wait for the share price to drop again? Can't they potentially earn more money with the (artificially) high prices?
I'm so glad this is here, because the answers are so helpful. 

My question is: Can a common person short-sale shares, or only hedge funds and the like?
How did no other hedge fund see the same markers for over shorting, but individual buyers were able to?
If I own stocks of a company, do I have any financial responsibility to that company?
In a short sell who is taking the other side of the bet? Where does the money that the short seller wins come from?
As a mentor of mine from the finance industry used to say, what we are seeing here with the short squeeze is “too many fat arses looking for the same thin exit.”

During the GFC, large fund managers learnt a very painful lesson about liquidity (being the amount of shares traded on a daily basis). If you own a lot of stock with low liquidity, you can’t exit your position very quickly, causing your eventual losses to be much larger by the time you sell. Many fund manager went under because of this, and most funds have strict minimal liquidity requirements before they will buy into a stock.

The failure here is by a number of hedge funds seemingly not learning this lesson, and quite frankly they deserve to go to the wall because of it. Greed + stupidity is a dangerous combination.
Ordinary people are called “retail traders”. So, the top hats get to trade wholesale?
[deleted]
What I don't understand, is what's in it for the lenders of a certain stock (under normal circumstances) when a short is occurring?  Don't they know the borrowers are betting on that stock to lose money?  And if that's the case, why wouldn't they just want to sell it themselves before the stock price drops and get a bigger return?  Or are they betting on the price to go up?   Or are they planning to keep the stock long term anyways and they don't care, so long as the stock is returned?
[deleted]
How can you tell that a hedge fund is shorting a stock?? Like where do you go to find that information?
Could WSB have done this with any cheap stock that wasn’t shorted? Did it matter that it was shorted so hard, besides screwing the hedge funds?
What happens to people who decide to HOLD e.g. GME when the hedge fund short positions expire if the hedge fund cannot afford to pay?
 I'm genuinely curious about a few things given the recent GME news

1. If a hedge fund or some other financial entity (I know so few technical terms) where to rally fellow institutions to all buy a single stock, would it be seen as illegal market manipulation? 

1. Assuming the above is market manipulation, would it still be illegal market manipulation if they instead, went on the news or went to reddit to advertise a competitors short position to short squeeze? 

I guess my question here is:

> would it have been illegal for a financial institution to do what wsb did? Or is the only distinction (and reason why it isn't illegal) being wsb actions being taken entirely by private citizens? 


Note I am not asking what is moral, etc I just want to understand why institutions are so butt hurt over the situation

Are they upset because they would get put in jail for pulling the same kind of stint?

Or are they genuinely upset purely because the public organised in a way that's perfectly legal that they couldnt replicate even if they were not in breach of regulations?
Will GameStop benefit from suddenly having a lot of shareholders who pumped money into it?
Would they be able to actually improve their business by using this money?
Admittedly, I do not have a very sophisticated understanding of this whole GameStop stock shorting situation, but if making a ton of money on the stock market is as simple as finding a stock that has been extremely shorted by hedge funds, and then getting thousands of people to put their money into it, how come this hasn’t been done earlier?  The internet has been around for decades and even r/wallstreetbets has been around for years. Why is this idea taking off now when it seems like a simple enough premise?  Am I missing something here?
ELI5: please explain the whole GameStop thing... should i be trying to buy a share? How are they “sticking it” to Wall Street?
What is the end goal for WSB? I understand that they want to make money. But when they keep saying buy and hold, if everyone buys it now and sits on it then won't the bubble burst and everyone who bought it will lose money. Are they purposefully sacrificing money just to stick it to hedge funds now or are they trying to make money in a way I'm not understanding?
If I owned stock in something that was failing, what would motivate me to let someone else sell it and make money on it and give me back my stock when it's worthless? I guess what I'm asking is, why does short selling even exist when it doesn't seem to benefit the actual owner of the stock?


edit: I gather that the stock's owner gets paid a bit for the use of their stock. But that just raises a further question. If the short seller can make so much money that they can both pay these fees and make a profit, just by selling this stock right now at its current price, why wouldn't the stock's actual owner just sell it themselves and keep all that money for themselves?
Will the *rest* of the stock market be seriously affected?

Like, us regular people who have our savings in basic index funds?

What about Gamestop itself? As a company, does it benefit from these events or is it bad news?
\*Hedgie Strategy Today\*

&#x200B;

First off, I don’t know what I am doing and this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

This is a really important day.  The hedgies are going to be out for blood and this is what I would I would do if I was on the other side of this trade.

We know from yesterday that the brokerage accounts all feed our information to the hedge funds.  They know where our autocalling positions are, how much we are driving the price up with our buys now that we can and have placed long positions before the market open.

&#x200B;

We also know that they were able to buy at the bottom of the market yesterday and some of us even had positions close at this point without our consent.

&#x200B;

Finally, we know that Steve Cohen was forced to shut down SAC Capital due to insider trading allegations in 2014 and they have given the hedge funds $2 billion which they would’ve used to take a long position at the market bottom yesterday to help cover their short position.  They have insider information on all of our positions.  They know the battle ground and will be planning accordingly.

&#x200B;

If I was a hedgie, I would also drive the market up when it opens, taking profit as I go.  I would then get to a point where we have set off a lot of auto calls and I would sell out of my long position.  This would drive the market down and I would then sell out of my short position.  

&#x200B;

Since we have been given the ability to jump back in, we're all charging into the market now that we can buy again. As we know from what we've found out today, Robinhood along with the other brokerage accounts give the hedge funds information on our positions, autocalls, and all investments we make. I think what might happen is we're gonna drive the market up when it opens, and as the hedge funds know this they will buy long positions and also drive the price up. The point of this is to hit our autocall positions so that we sell out. Just as we hit our autocalls, the hedge funds will sell their long positions and create a massive sell off between our autocalls and their sell offs. This will drive the price down to a point where they can sell their short positions which are calling today. We therefore need to remove our autocalls so as to continue to drive the price up. Continue to sustainably buy throughout the day so that they can't take advantage of any dips to close their short calls. They fucked us yesterday and created a dip so they could buy long positions. They bought this dip and drove the price up to 230. They have a lot of firepower to be able to do this from Point72 and Citadel.

&#x200B;

Tldr: Remove your autocalls and continue to buy sustainably throughout the day and we'll all be eating meat in Valhalla by evening. 

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice and I do not know what the fuck I'm talking about. Do whatever the fuck you want.
Are people who have zero experience with trading able to somehow contribute to the further downfall of these rich wallstreet pigs? If so, how?
Okay so my question is pretty simple.

Why are there statements from analysts saying this sets a dangerous prescendent? It seems like the average Joes banded together and did something with collective capital, that individual funds with huge capital do all the time?

They lost out, which I guess would normally be a smaller amount spread out between a lot of average Joe's instead of a huge amount on few funds?

Isn't this only setting a prescendent that stocks are high risk which should have already been known?

I'm trying my best to look at all of this objectively but it really looks like a huge glaring proof of wealth inequality.

I'm super keen to see some point of views from the opposite side of the fence if anyone has it, I.e people who think this is a bad situation etc.

Edit: really appreciate the replys all. What a complex situation... I'm not going to pretend I fully understand what's going on but I'm really enjoying learning all this and better understanding it as I go.

Is this the right post to ask for an ELI5 about the mayhem at r/wallstreetbets?

What I think I understand is this: These people are actually playing with real money. They are spending their own hard-earned cash, right?

What I don’t understand and want to is this:  These people saying they’re now sudden millionaires; can they actually stop at any time (notwithstanding addiction to the game) and have real millions in their actual bank accounts?  Or are they paying real money to a broker for a promise that if it doesn’t come true the only person who comes away with any real, spendable profits is the broker?

From what little I understand is happening, it seems like the plot of the Mel Brooks movie “The Producers” where if it all goes to plan, the only people who profit are the producers of the play, not the writers, backers, actors or venue.
I really don't understand this. I keep reading that if people hold GME, then the stock price would go very high like $5k or more due to short squeeze. I feel like at that point, wouldn't the hedge fund just declare bankruptcy instead of paying such high prices to cover their shorts? At that time, won't the folks holding the stock, end up having to sell it for less since regular folks won't be able to pay such high prices to buy the stock?
When a buyer buys a share at $20.00 then the next buyer has to buy it at $20.05

Why does this happen?

Who changes the price?

How is the change in price calculated? Why $0.05 and not $0.10 or $1.00?

Question: is there any way things could go wrong for wsb holders, now or in the near future, regarding their GME/BB/etc stocks?
[deleted]
[removed]
Is there evidence (other than the GME/Robin hood-case which is ofcourse to recent for there to be any research done yet) that market manipulation by "big money"/hedge funds/big investors actually happens?

Edit:  I phrased myself poorly, I was specificly looking for cases of market  manipulation where big money had manipulated the price of a stock *LIKE* in the GME-case. Essentially what I want to know is if this is as commonplace that it happens and goes unpunished by "big money" as some friends want me to believe.
How can a company short more stocks than there are available?
I get what a short is. You borrow a stock from a broker, sell it, hope its price goes down, buy it back at the lower price, return the cheaper stock to the broker, and pocket the difference.

ELI5 how it is legal to borrow more of a stock than exists \*in the world\*.
[removed]
How could they short stock more stock, than there exist? I can't process this. 

Also, shouldn't an automated system detect these 'additional' stocks and someone would start an investigation on this?
Why would a hedge fund ever get a bailout (as people seem to be discussing this possibility in anger), isn’t a hedge fund a private fund for the ultra rich? Why would they need a bailout? What purpose are they serving the general public?
Since robinhood blocked buying stock but still allows the selling of stocks, who gets the sold gamestop stocks?
What's the difference between buying a stock and buying an option?
At what stage do the hedge funds actually lose money? Can’t they all just ride it out and wait for the bubble to burst and stock prices return to normal?
[deleted]
If I understand correctly, it's now forbidden to buy but it's still allowed to sell. But then, WHO buys? (Not a Native English speaker and definitely uneducated about stock market).
Is there a possibility this will lead to a global market chrash or is it just contained in the US?
Does the gamestop company have any legal course of action they can take against the investment companies that restricted the purchase of their shares?
So, the hedge funds have lost $70 billion.  Did that money actually go anywhere?  Is it gained by anyone?  Or is it just on a theoretical balance sheet?
Essentially, imagine looking at a price. Let's say $5.00 
If you spend that $5.00 on a share, you raise the value of the next share purchase. 

If someone else sees that price and buys before you, you have lost the opportunity to buy a share for $5.00 
It now raises.

If someone sells their share (which may have been purchased at a lower or higher price) during the time you are looking at this $5.00 price, it will lower the cost of the share.
It now falls.

High market velocity is "surfed" on the backs of foolish plebs who have purchased their shares after you. 

Your enemy is the people selling. You want to sell before them, because when they sell, it lowers the prices.

Notice you are both these parties. In essence, the stock market is a digital manifestation of hype.

Because you can now purchase fractions of a share and crypto currency
"Huh, I'm interested in that, I'll click like." 
Is the way to go. Think early facebook where you "liked" every thing you were into. Replace "like" with "put a dollar or a thousand into assuming other people will like it" and you essentially have the formula to success.

These days, people are sending droves to the market from a single tweet. If you liked it before it was cool, you're more valuable.
Hedge fund managers are coming out and saying what r/wallstreetbets is doing is price manipulation and illegal.

My question is, fundamentally what is the difference between thousands of people working together to influence stock price and one/a few billion-dollar hedge funds doing it? Do hedge funds do something else in tandem that mitigates risks to the economy in any way?
Can someone explain why short sellers can't just hold onto their position for longer (months) until the situation calms down and the bubble bursts?
Anyone willing to explain how this ends through a series of scenarios? Really curious about how far this could go.
How long do the common people need to hold before the hedge funds have to buy the stock at the inflated price to complete the short?
I may have missed it, but what happens if the hedge fund has to buy the shares at the high price and they go bankrupt?  

I heard that the banks are on the hook?

What effect does this have on the NYSE and will it affect the entire market? In what way?
How does anyone buying GME make actual cash off of it? Sure the value of the stock is increasing but it's not real money until you sell it. Won't the prices crash back down when the bubble pops and everyone wants to sell?
[removed]
I bought stocks for AMC (~$215) and NOK (~$164) using Fidelity around 11:50 pm. It says it was a "day order"? Just wanted to see if I did something stupid or if i'm good :-/ should I have wanted until the market opens again tomorrow...? Thanks in advance :-)
[deleted]
Why is Friday a deadline, what forces the short sellers to cover their position, other than accruing interest? Don't they decide when they buy back?
So theoretically, if I bought up as many GameStop stocks as I could before all this started, and sell them all now, would I basically be fucking loaded with no risk of losing it?
This is u/DeepFuckingValue's first post on WSB. Can someone explain how he purchased these stocks and why his "bid-ask" spreads are ridiculous (at least that is what the top comment said):

So from what I understand, some redditors let some rich people fall into their own trap through Game Stop. But what exactly is this trap? How did they controll the market before? My stock market knowledge just goes as far as animal crossing teached me.
Can someone more clearly explain day trading regulation to me? Why can't I buy during dips and sell during peaks all throughout the day? Or can I? How does the process work?
How did the folks at WSB see that GME was being shorted? Is the # of borrowed stocks publicly available on some investing website?
I think I've garnered a reasonable understanding of how shorts work, but the thing that isn't clear to me is what the benefit for the lender is.

As I understand it, the Shorter borrows stocks from a Lender, presumably at some form of interest, sells them, and then banks on the stock going down so he can buy them back more cheaply to return them. This seems rather disadvantageous to the Lender, unless the Lender is reasonably confident that the Shorter is wrong in their assessment of the market.

Is this just a zero sum game in which the Shorter and Lender are basically betting against each other? or is there some other benefit to the Lender that I am missing?
Can someone please explain to me the legal/ethical ramifications of Elon Musk tweeting #Gamestonk or #Bitcoin and then those markets seeing huge rises. He clearly wields a significant influence on the market - what is stopping him from going all in on something - tweeting everyone to jump on board and then make bank?
A big issue that is being raised rn is that people on reddit have manipulated the market by investing money individually into GME. But dont hedge funds do the same? They collect money from various investors and through the power of this massive amount of money, bet on the market which has the side effect of changing the market. How is one considered manupulation and the other fair business practice?
Why are so many people wanting to crush this one particular hedge fund? / anti hedge funds
So if these Hedgefunds are making bets that GME will go down. GME is going up. When do the Hedgefunds that put the bet pay that difference?
Take the advice of people that answer here with a grain of salt.

I'm seeing so many people answer questions that think they know what they are talking about but I can tell they literally just learned it themselves 4 minutes ago.
How can 150% of a company's shares be shorted at once? How can MORE STOCKS THAT EXIST be shorted at the same time? And does it have something to do with "[naked short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling)" and 'ghost stocks'? Or is it just the same stocks being shorted multiple times? What does that look like in practice?
A **stock** is like a piece of company. You can see how good they are, what the profits are, how risky it is, and say "I want to own some of it - split (already made) costs, share future profits"... So you get a stock. The price of the stock in an ideal market reflects how much profit you estimate it makes.

In a **real market**, a single company has only so many stocks - think number of left backs and quality of left backs. So **supply and demand** plays a big role in determining price. There's also people in the market that will hold out on their pick and refuse to sell them cos they "like the underdog" or for other more human, less profit driven reasons. And if the only left back that Pep wants is Cancelo, then you can hold out for 60m£ and that's that, regardless of how much he's actually worth.

And like sport, there's **side betting** - "I bet this guy wins the Champions League" or "gets sold for less than 5m". So bets can be binary or based off how far from an arbitrary threshold you are. And bets can have odds (prices reflect that). The good thing about a bet is you don't need a share in a football club to profit off an opinion. You can put far lesser money... Or leverage - "Every million above 5m, I get you 100 beers. Vice versa for below 5m". And just like the beers, some bets have limited upside, lots of downside. called **derivatives** - cos they derive from the share price but don't need a share. Others involve a handshake to go "I'll get a share from you for this price, and sell back to you at market value in six months, and since you think Arsenal is on the decline it will be cheaper then and you'll make a profit". Called a put option (or a **short**)

Funds - like hedge funds - use these trading and betting strategies to make money. This has been a growing component in the market - right now there are companies that if they lose a big bet, can drastically affect the market - like a mafioso betting on Pogba transfers with a billion dollars. Trading will be suspended sometimes.

In the news recently, a hedge fund punched in numbers on a stock (happens to be GameStop) - and pledged to short - i.e  sell X stocks they didn't have and buy back later to return to settle sale - hoping to drive down price. The problem was X was 140% the number of total stocks for that company. People in /r/wallstreetbets noticed that. And bought up some stocks - to hold out like Cancelo. They knew the hedge fund would need to buy in the next few days. And they knew it needed every last stock. So they spread the word, and the price went up as more people bought it. And the hedge fund's bet went really bad. This is a **short squeeze**. You know the hedge fund has this short position, that they're desperate for the Cancelo, so you hold out for 50m (price increase).

There's a lot more nastiness, politics, slander behind the scenes, but strip them away, and this is just a bad bet, and people who took advantage of that mistake. And it happens every day.

What is the composition of the capital contributors to main hedge funds? In particular, are there significant contributions from people's retirement funds/pensions?
How many shares are created when a company goes public? Can you see this number for every stock? Can the amount ever change or is it fixed? Does a single entity own every share when a company initially goes public?
I have questions regarding how this might affect trading in the future. Say down the road, will it be possible for a hedge fund to CLAIM that they heavily shorted a stock, triggering a squeeze when in reality the bought / placed calls on the stock to capitalize on the price increase? Or are shorts / calls of that magnitude generally reported for all to see?
How did the hedge funds let it get this far? Why didn’t they close their positions earlier, when the GME price increased from $5 to $30 instead of $300 now?
So, I read that there is a difference between "market value" and "actual value," and that while GameStop's market value is great right now, that doesn't mean the company is doing well. I mean, the reason the hedge fund was shorting them in the first place was because they were doing so poorly.

So what happens to GameStop the company? Why does their market value not have an impact on the business itself? And what happens if GameStop were to declare bankruptcy, let's say tomorrow?
Why aren't hedge funds joining WSB in buying GME? Wouldn't they profit just like anyone else?

What is a good alternative to Robinhood?

Total noob here:  
What happens if a hedgefund looses this much money? 30B? 70B? Will it not have adverse effects on the rest of the economy / society? Is it not similar to what happened in 2008?

I am personally delighted to see the average people fight back, but what if by doing so, we create a huge vacuum in the economy, and the banks and money-people will be bailed out again, with the rest of the economy collapsing again, resulting in the same crisis we had in 2008?
Can someone borrow stocks from my portfolio with out my permission? If so, can I somehow lose money from it?
Is there any advantage to, or difference between, buying GME stock during market after hours and waiting to buy at markets opening?
Why can’t the hedge fund people just buy other stock? Why does game stop stock affect the entire market? Like why do they want/need this one so much? I know it’s currently valued high but is there more to it than that?

ETA: please literally explain like I’m 5, I’m so brain dead at the moment
Oh this is funny, i asked about this 2 days ago and it was removed because "this sub is not about contemporary events"
Do the short squeeze wall street brokers pay now? This is what I don't understand. Or like everyday they have to pay? If the stoke will fall eventually don't the brokers just have to wait and they will win? When do they have to pay the billions I see people say they are losing?

I really don't understand when the shorting brokers have to pay. I keep seeing they are losing 70 billion but if they have lost that, when do they have to pay?

Edit: Ya'll are Champs! I get it now lol. Thanks alot this part just didn't make any sense to me. You guys have a good day screwing them over!
Think of 2 football games:

1. The Football Championship Game in a huge professional stadium, to take place in a giant warm weathered city (The Big Game). The stadium fits 20 Million people.
2. An exhibition game in a tiny high school stadium, in a small arctic town (The Small Game). The stadium fits  20 thousand people.

Everyone wants to go to The Big Game, and prices for a ticket are $1,000 and rising.

However there really is no reason for anyone to attend The Small Game. Tickets are $10 and there is no reason to think they are going anywhere but down.

A short sale is an agreement to sell something for a future price.

So a person, lets says call him 'Shmedge' might 'short' the Small Game by saying "OK I promise to sell 20 thousand tickets to the Small Game, for the current price, $10. Shmedge's thinking is that by the time the game starts, people will be pretty much giving away tickets for $1, on account of no one having any interest in going. Shmedge's grand plan is to buy all the tickets for $1, sell them at the agreed upon $10, and make a cool $9 on each ticket. He does this for all 20 thousand tickets.

Now imagine some more facts come out about the Small Game. The stadium operator announces that they will be handing out free beer. It turns out it will be an unseasonably warm day that day. Two professional teams take the place of the high school teams that were supposed to play. A major airline starts operating flights to this small town. All of a sudden the Small Game is now **THE GAME.**

At this point, **EVERYONE** wants a ticket to the Small Game. However, since the stadium is so small, ticket prices rise fast. The diehard fans already have their tickets to the game, and fully intend to be there for kickoff. Since the stadium is so small to begin with, the ticket availability dries up fast. Now there are **no tickets** left to this once meaningless game. To try to get a ticket is to stand outside the stadium and ask all the people in the parking lots if they would consider parting with their golden tickets.

"Hey! You paid $10 for that ticket, what if I double it, give you $20? Nope? $40? $200? $400? Still nope? What do you mean you won't part with it? OK, well I'll keep saying numbers and you tell me if there is any number that will make you budge."

In the meanwhile, remember Shmedge? Well he still has an outstanding promise to sell 20 thousand tickets for $10/each, and kickoff time for the game is only drawing nearer. GUH.

TL:DR If you 'short' a valueless item, and that item then quickly picks up value, you are still on the hook to deliver that item.
How does this affect the company itself?  Do they have more money now?  My basic understanding of stocks are originally they are supposed to be a way for a company to raise money, right?

I guess this is less about stock, but more about this situation, but nobody seems to be talking about how the Gamestop itself is affected.
I haven’t seen this answered yet, sorry if I missed it.

What happens if no one sells? If lenders want their stocks back and those who shorted can’t provide them, then what?
What's a short ladder?
I was reading about “hedging” on the other thread. Do people ever short stock that they already own? Like, that way, maybe they could make a profit whether it goes up or down?
1. If I have a fidelity account and bought stock today, but it came out of my 2021 Roth IRA contribution account... can I still buy more stock tomorrow and add more money to just a regular trading account?

2. If I sell the stock I bought today some point tomorrow, can I then buy more of that stock again later on tomorrow? Or do they not let you sell then buy the same stock within a certain period?
I see a lot of people saying they are doing this to "help" Gamestop? How does the share price skyrocketing help the company? 

Also, cant the hedge funds hold out too and wait for the price to go back down after all the hype?
Why is everyone excited for tomorrow morning?
What actually happens if the hedge fund broker cannot make margin call and just goes bankrupt while still owing shares?  Who does he owe shares to, and what happens to the entity that loaned the shares for the short instrument and what happens to the market?

Last night I was listening to LBC, and they had people explaining what had gone on, to which I understood most of what they had to say.
The one thing that confused me is when they said that they were shorting more stock than the company had, stocks that don't exist, how is that possible?
Here a link to investopedia. It’s like a dictionary for stock terms. If you have questions, this may help.

So I want to start investing, and plan to soon. What I am concerned with is me messing something up and owing money somehow.

My question is if I put lets say 2k into fidelity and buy stocks there is no way I can lose more than 2k initially?
I see people on Wallstreetbets who look like they owe money somehow, I don't understand it lol.

All I really want to do is buy and hold stock, maybe sell months later if I made a few bucks.

Okay so if I'm understanding correctly, GME is deemed "artificially" valuable because more than just the stock price affects a company's valuation. Got it.

The whole "artificially valuable" thing sounds bad, BUT why is it such a bad thing (from GME'S position) to have this influx of purchased shares of its stock? The whole purpose of a company selling stock is so that it can gain additional funds needed to grow the business, fund operations, purchase assets, etc.

So why can't GME just take all this new money from stock purchases and buy itself a plan to get out of its operational run? Hire the best of the best R&D team, advertising agency, etc to rebrand itself and recreate a dying business. Then with time, it'll hopefully earn itself a legitimate high valuation.

What am I missing?

Edit: Thanks so much guys! Got it now...makes sense.

What happens after the hedge funds are forced to sell? Will these new millionaire's... just be millionaire's now?
There is a lot of talk about how the US government will introduce legislation to protect hedge funds from events like this in the future. How could legislation like this be realized? As far as I understand it, nobody did anything illegal or anything that the hedge funds themselves weren't doing already. Would it be possible to lock out "private" traders from the stock market altogether?
Suppose someone "borrows" your stock and then fails to return it (because it costs them too much to replace, or isn't for sale at any price). They simply don't have as much assets as they owe, and they go bankrupt.

Is that a realistically possible scenario? And if it were to happen, are your "borrowed" shares permanently lost?

Or are the borrowing contracts secured somehow? (And if so, _how?_)
One question I have about shorting shares is if I borrow from someone and I buy the share at a lower price than what the borrower gave me why would the borrower want it back if it’s at a lower price?
I would like to thank all of you for your explanation of this situation. Using other examples of how all this happened made it easier to comprehend for the Average Joe.
Wouldnt it be logical that the price will stop going up now because its reched the point redditors wnt be able to afford the price of a share or can a very small part of a share be bought meaning the price of share wont stop people buying in?

Why can't GME just issue new stock?
They can raise a lot of money this way, especially knowing that the current high prices are unlikely to remain for long.
How do investors know that there are still a lot of short positions for a given company, doesn't that information come out only 1-2 per month?

ELI5: So how does the the human brain ignore the second the?

We don't actually read every word in a sentence. Our brains pick up the patterns and fill in the blanks as we skim along the text, which greatly increases our reading speed while doing very little to reduce comprehension.

We do it with just about all sensory input, as well. We blank out while driving but still reach our destinations with no incidents, we tune out smells pretty quickly (no matter how bad the smell is), we tune out physical sensations (you're now aware of how your tongue is resting in your mouth, also you're breathing manually), we hit that autopilot button at work and just coast through it while thinking about the grocery shopping, etc.

It's probably an evolutionary trait that evolved from a need to be vigilant against **unique sensory input**, like sudden movements and noticing things that aren't supposed to be there. We're good at recognizing patterns, and tune things out to reduce overall taxation from sensory inputs so we can instead focus on novel inputs.

&#x200B;

Small edit: I'm an English tutor, and one of the practices we use to catch those kinds of mistakes is to read the whole text backward. Doing this tricks the brain into not recognizing the speech patterns and causes it to focus on each word.
Short version: Our brains are tuned for pattern recognition and prediction, not detail. That's also why things that break the expected pattern/outcome can be so jarring. Sometimes it's in a fun way, though. See movie twists, stage magic, joke punchlines and so on.  


It's a filtering mechanism.  Ignore the leaves, see the broken up/partial shape or movement of the predator hiding behind them.

We're too used to reading English that we don't actually read every word, but the sentence as a whole.

(When I was learning Spanish in school I had to read every word and then combine them to understand what it means)
Your brain doesn't take in information. It takes in patterns on information. 

I dotn haev to be detialed in my tpying for you to now wat I'm sayin.

You can read what I just wrote. Just like you can understand the gist of a sentence with two thes.  

You get the pattern, and then you can disregruard.
I'm guessing people who are learning English won't skip it naturally as they are not used to the patterns and are more focussed on piecing together the meaning?
Brains are lazy. They are quick to guess, and they "check" the guess as lazily as possible.

More accurately; brains need to be as fast as possible while using as little energy as possible, so we can out-compete everything else and not get killed - same as all life. That's what makes you successful; use the minimum resources to get what you need. Which is why life takes short-cuts - as long as they work more often than not...

It applies to all levels of things; from your example, to people more readily believing things they already know more than anything new to them - regardless of reality.

Your brain is very efficient (lazy). It can ignore redundancies unless you focus on them. A neat experiment to do ( but can be difficult) is if you stare at one point for a good amount of time, and I mean stare don't move your eyes even a bit, you'll notice it starts to disappear. Your brain is saying this is not new input so I will ignore it. Its why your eyes are constantly doing micro movements you may not notice and why when look from one thing to another quickly you don't see a blur but instead feels like your vision teleported.

What we 'see' isn't what's actually there.  It's the same as how we have a big blind spot in the center of our field of vision and our brain fills in the details.

Our eyes detect light and send signals to our brain.  Our brain interprets those signals and builds a model of the world that isn't necessarily accurate, but is usually good enough for us to function.

Things like this show that the model built isn't necessarily accurate, but that details will be filled in by our brain based on surrounding detail.

Another one is that I can type words incorrectly and as long as the first and last letters are present a quick raed show that your brain will fill in the detials and 'show' you the correct word.
Superfluous information. Your conscious mind has what it came for and discards the rest. Think if it as data compression.

Because when you read the the sentence, your brain creates the sentence in your head first and then breaks down the meaning as a whole not just the individual words. So your brain just ignores it because it already has a sentence so ignores the other the.

Does this have anything to do with the fact that our eyes only senses a small part of reality while our brains fill in the rest of the world? There’s a notion in Sleight of Hand where a good performer can “feel” where all the eyes are and exploit it by forcing the audience to follow the big movements while hiding the smaller ones. 

It’s supposed to be based on old hunting/tracking skills.

Human brains are very sophisticated pattern recognition machines. More sophisticated than many AI or algorithmic computers even. Pattern recognition revolves around uses minimal input to form a complete picture. That’s also how we read, you don’t actively read every word once you’re used to reading. Your brain infers the meaning of a sentence based on a number of keywords and its experience in reading similar sentences. After ‘the’ you get an adjective or a substantive so no need to read the second ‘the’. Our visual or olfactory system work in exactly the same way. You exclude long-term input (your nose is always in your line of sight), but are very susceptible to short-term changes (sudden movement).

ELI5: Why can people walk many miles without discomfort, but when they stand for more than 15 minutes or so, they get uncomfortable?

Your leg veins have [one way valves](http://www.merckmanuals.com/~/media/manual/home/images/cvs_one_way_valves_veins.gif?la=en&thn=0) in them. They work when the [skeletal muscles around them contract and release.](http://www.theveincenterar.com/images/Picture4.jpg)

When you are walking around, the flexion/relaxation of the walking muscles are literally pumping the blood back to your torso.  When you are standing still, you aren't getting that pumping action naturally.  You *could* flex/release your legs intentionally, while standing, but it's not nearly as effective as walking is.

Hope that makes sense!
I work at a vein surgeon's office. I actually asked him this.

Basically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and "pools" in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body. 

On the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements  to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.  

Edit: As others have suggested, not locking your knees is also key

Edit 2: As others have mentioned, micro movements could be flexing your calves, distributing weight back and forth between your heels and toes, wiggling your toes, etc. 

Edit 3: If you have persistent leg problems even without prolonged standing and even after conservative measures (compression stockings, exercise, etc.), I would recommend getting a referral to a vein specialist from your PCP (in the US) to get it properly treated. You may just have bad veins. 

Whoa! My very first gold. Thank you stranger 😝
When you stand, the same muscles in your feet fire repeatedly as the pressure on them remains constant. However, when you walk about, the pressure shifts to and from different areas of your foot as the same muscles aren’t working all the time. If you have a sore area on your foot, walking will be less painful than standing as the pressure is on the area for less time
A lot of the answers on here are focused on blood flow which is great but it misses a big part of it. Your joints are lubricated by their joint fluid (synovial fluid). The way the get new fluid and nutrients is through movement. When you stand still the fluid is not refreshed and it tends to dry out in a sense. This makes joints painful and causes that stiff feeling when you try to start moving again. Shortly after moving the fluid and nutrients are replenished and things move again.

Circulation is a big part but joint movement is what provides the fluid flow. If you kept your joints still and contracted the muscles to get blood flowing you would still feel the majority of stiffness and aches.
Walking increases blood flow. Standing causes it to pool in your legs. More blood flow means more oxygen to the muscles and more efficient removal of edit: lactic acid buildup. Standing also means keeping your muscles rigid, which is much more stressful on them than simply moving, where periods of contraction and release have points where less energy is being used. If you want an example, try doing slow curls vs fast curls. Your muscles will fatigue faster from slow tension than quick tension.

edit: This really applies to any muscle groups used in moving around.
Surgeon here. It all has to do with physiologic load. We are not anatomically designed to accommodate static (standing in one position) loads for an extended period of time. None of our load-bearing tissues (primarily bone) have rigid viscoelastic properties sufficient to withstand static stress (bone is actually a relatively soft material compared to metal etc). Walking,or even shifting weight while standing, will redistribute our body's load on the weight bearing tissues in our legs and allows those tissues to 'recover' during the phase when the body position changes.
Also your mind is more active as you walk so it's focused less on discomfort. Different hormones are released too and this also affects the way your brain is working in response to discomfort. So me boxers continue fighting with a broken hand. Some runners with sprains and maybe fractures. Sometimes people who just work hard forget to eat.

Blood in your body is pumped by the heart. This moves it out, away from your heart. The blood vessels that lead away from your heart have valves that keep the blood from flowing backwards. As blood reaches the farthest part of your body it is separated into many tiny tubes that supply all the parts of your body. This causes the blood to slow down A LOT. 

When blood goes to return to the heart there are valves in the in those blood vessels which help to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Also, because it has now slowed down it does not move back to the heart very easily, the forward pressure is much lower than in your arteries. This allows gravity to overcome them and allow blood to flow backwards (this is less common in a healthy person). The tubes in your legs that send blood back to the heart are surrounded by your leg muscles. When you walk they are squeezed and this pushes the blood back to your heart. Without the extra pressure from your leg muscles pumping it can be difficult to overcome the force of gravity pulling downwards on the blood. 

When you stand those muscles aren't pushing the blood so it becomes harder to move it. This means that the old, used up blood, is stuck in the lowest point of your body. This is your feet. Because the blood is used up it has no oxygen to keep the muscles in your feet healthy. 

When your body senses there is not enough oxygen it sends signals to your brain that trick it into thinking there is pain. This causes you to try and move the part of the body that is in pain which ideally allows fresh blood to flow in with new oxygen. This is also why it feels like your chest burns when you hold your breath. 
As someone with POTS I know the reason for this on a very personal level. I've failed two tilt table tests because walls of my arteries don't produce enough force to keep an adequate amount of blood pumping up to my brain resulting in dizziness and blurred vision upon standing upright. When I get up I immediately have to start walking so my calf muscles push on the arteries in my legs to produce the force needed. Sometimes I have to flex my calf muscles before standing up to prevent my blood from pooling in my legs. I also wear compression socks to prevent venous pooling. I cannot work jobs that require me to be on my feet in a stationary spot because I get insane amounts of fatigue and lightheadedness. I also have to use a shower chair to  wash myself. I have to sit in a chair to cook. Standing is so unbearable that I dread getting up out of bed every morning. I have to get up in increments so my body can adjust to the change in posture. 
[Circulation.](http://www.jobst.com/mainnavigation/leg-health/veins-valves.html) When you walk the flexing of your calf muscles help push the blood up your legs back to your heart. A failure of these valves can cause varicose veins.
Nerves in the soles of your feet that are stimulated by pressure when you stand up send signals "upstream". These signals cause the activation of a number of muscles throughout your body, not just in your legs, to help maintain your posture. 

Nerves can emit a limit amount of neurotransmitter to broadcast their signal before they need to "reload." If you activate these nerves too long - for example by standing still for a few minutes without varying the pressure on your soles - you'll deplete the neurotransmitter, the signals to your posture muscles will start to fail, and you'll feel fatigued and start to wobble.

Source: I did research at NASA in the 90s about this. We were trying to help figure out how to minimize atrophy on astronauts on long trips in microgravity. One discovery is that all of their posture muscles atrophied, but applying constant pressure to their soles (e.g., wrapping their feet tightly) wasn't an effective solution.

For more reading, check the variable foot pressure research done by Prof. Chuck Layne at the University of Houston.
Just an aside: this * \* points to the rest of the thread\* * is why, in any civilized jurisdiction, workplace-safety regulations consider standing in a single place for long periods to be a hazardous condition, and require it to be mitigated by things like fatigue mats and regular breaks.
Follow-up question here. When I feel physical fatigue from standing it's in my lower back. However from walking it's likely in my legs.

Is this because of my stance/posture or more related to the fact that one is dynamic and the other is not? I'm seeing a lot of unsourced suggestions in this topic (even though it is ELI5) and I'm doubting the accuracy.
For me, personally, I have an arch in my spine (I assume most people do, but mine seems to be more pronounced than usual), so when I stand for 10-15 minutes, the arch basically compresses my spine and causes discomfort. I've found that sucking my stomach in and squeezing my butt alleviates some of the discomfort, but not all. Whereas when I'm walking, I'm constantly changing position, so my spine gets a break.

Now, if I'm doing a standing/walking combo like at the mall or at a museum... that is *brutal*.
I think it has something to do with your body being built to be in motion. Osteokinematically you are good at walking and running for hunting. We are built for the "hunt" but we aren't made very well for just having a lot of loading in a stationary position. 

So imagine our skeleton is a bunch of levers and our muscles are just the ropes making it move. It is easy for your body to keep that up as it isn't too strenuous with the loading and unloading of joints. However standing in one position you have all your weight on those same joints in your pelvis and spine. This constant compression is uncomfortable and isn't what your body is optimised for. 
Wow ive been wondering why everytime i go to the mall and do nothing my back hurts. I am a landscaper and im constantly moving around and lifting things yet my back never goes out/hurts i always thought maybe it was the stress knowing i have to spend money at some point lol
When you stand the blood slows down and stays in your legs. When you move your legs your blood flows more easily. Your blood always needs to flow and moving your legs helps the blood move along so standing still will make you restless or even fall asleep!
My old choir teacher would say it probably has to do with you locking your legs, -that's why Jimmy passed out during the *Hallelujah Chorus*-! 
Looks like you've received many great answers already! I just wanted to add that I'm (nearly) an Occupational Therapist (still working on my master's...one year to go!) and we get tons of requests to recommend a standing desk for clients at work (so insurance will cover it). I probably only recommend a standing desk one time out of ten because people usually try it out, realize that standing is uncomfortable, then never use the standing option again. And these desks cost about $2000 where I live. A MUCH better option is to keep your existing desk, get a proper ergonomic assessment, and set a timer to stand up and walk about once every 45-60 minutes. By changing position and moving around once an hour you get the blood flowing, joints moving, and muscles stretched out. It's the change of position and movement that's helpful, less so the standing! Plus by leaving your desk for a couple of minutes (instead of simply raising your desk to standing-position) your eyes get a break and hopefully your brain too! :) 
Related question: why am i more tired walking through a museum than a rigorous hike of the same distance traveled? Same answer or does the mental processing of art viewing affect me?
So where do standing desks play into this? 
In addition to blood pooling as several people have described there is also biomechanical reason. Our bodies are not designed to engage in static activities (holding a position without moving) very efficiently. On the contrary, walking is a dynamic activity (anything with joint motion) which our bodies are designed to do efficiently. 

Furthermore, most people have really bad standing posture and pretty weak lower posterior kinetic chain muscles (hammies, glutes, low back muscles). Poor posture usually places extra stress on the low back, which once it begins to get tired you can then pick up the slack with other muscle groups like your traps. 
Our calves serve as "auxiliary hearts", pumping blood back up the veins, against all that mighty gravity: this is why those veins have valves, to prevent backward flow of stale blood (and when they don't function properly, you get varicose veins, which I also suffer from). But, calf muscles are purely voluntary, and therefore if you aren't using them, you're slowly depriving your leg muscles of fresh oxygen. That causes anaerobic respiration (aerobic = using oxygen), which is not only ineffective and inefficient, it produces a lot of toxic waste, including lactic acid. This is what causes one's legs to feel heavy/tired, and why stretching and compressing relieves such aches.
The cartilages in your knees work best if they are squeezed and released alternatively. Tho allows the lubricant liquid to get distributed evenly in the joints to allow less friction when walking. Standing would just press on the cartilages once and the fluid would move away from the pressure points after some time. So yeah we are designed better for walking rather than standing for long periods of time. 

Edit: it has to do also with squeeze-film lubrification, that happens in the knee when walking

When you stand in one place for a long time, you get uncomfortable? Whoa. Walkers are wild.

Physical Therapist here. Surprised no one has mentioned this yet, but there are 2 types of muscle fibers out there. Type 1 and Type 2. 

Type 1 muscle fibers are slow twitch fibers and are meant to maintain posture and low energy activities such as standing. Our calf muscles are primarily slow twitch muscles. Standing up in one position is an isometric activity where we are basically just standing still and not necessarily moving. Type 1 is primarily an anaerobic activity where there is almost a time-limit on how long one can sustain this position (think from the movie Drumline and they were holding only their drumsticks in the air and fatigued rapidly)

Type 2 muscle fibers are for quicker actions, muscles that constantly moving and contracting. Walking quickly or on uneven terrain activates these type 2 muscle fibers and this is an aerobic activity which means that oxygen is constantly replenishing these muscles so they don't fatigue.
The human species is the most adept at walking long distances of nearly every species on the planet. Forest Gump was no joke.
You probably feel uncomfortable standing still for 15 minutes because of all the people that are looking at you just standing there 
So then does anyone have any suggestions on what shoe soles r best?
Follow up ELI5: How are we able to sit for such long periods of time if the blood is pooling in our legs?
Im a cook for a living. And my legs are so stiff, when I'm able to like walk off the line and sit down, my legs are just so stiff and it take at least ten minutes of stretching before I feel normal again. I think its its a slight muscle attrophy, but then again thats 11 to 12hours at a time. After fifteen minutes I'd tell you to see a doctor
This doesn't necessarily answer the question but perhaps still relatable. One thing I noticed while I'm jogging is when I start to get tired I'm left with two decisions, slow down and nearly stop or speed up. It appears to me increasing my acceleration always allows me the opportunity to last longer where as if I slow down, I can feel the strenuous motions in my body catching up to me and I get tired quicker.
Additional question: Why do people (I) feel discomfort in their shoulders while standing but not walking?

Oh my god. I just got back from a music festival where I was standing with a walking stick no bobbing my head n dancing but other times locking my legs n standing. My middle toe on my right foot kinda has felt numb for a day or two now any correlation. 

Tldr: dancing at long festivals may be better for you than standing.;)
If you're not moving, synovial fluid is gradually pushed out of the joint. When you move the joint is re-lubricated.
But what about back pain? I can hike for an entire day with a backpack and no problems. I spent two hours at an exhibition in a gallery and I wanted to lie on the floor. It's not enough to stop me from moving normally but it's agony for the rest of the day. I've no idea why!

Taking out all the technical terms, it is basically your body being at rest more often when walking as compared to standing. 

The weight is distributed around the entire time while walking, hence allowing one to use more strength and different muscle groups. 

Where as in standing still, the weight is constant, hence no rest. 
ELI5: There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There are also infinite numbers between 0 and 2. There would more numbers between 0 and 2. How can a set of infinite numbers be bigger than another infinite set?

I think the problem is you are thinking of "infinite" to be "a very big number".  It is not a very big number, it's a different kind of thing.  A similar problem exists with zero, in that it's not just "a really small number", it's actually zero.  For example if I take a really small number like 0.0000001 and double it, I get 0.0000002.  If I take 0 and double it, I still get zero.  2x0 is not bigger than 1x0.  If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then they are separated by 0.  If I double all of those numbers, then they are separated by 2x0, so they are still separated by 0.

Edit: thanks for the kind words and shiny tokens of appreciation.  This is now my second highest voted post after a well timed Hot Fuzz quote, I guess that's what reddit is like.
The thing which helped me wrap my head around it (as much as I have) was when it was explained to me that infinity is not a number. Being infinite is a property of a set. 

So if you consider it as a different property - like “blue”, or “hot” - it makes more sense. You can’t count to blue, and whether one set is bigger than another doesn’t affect whether it is blue or not.
Here's a way to see that there are the same "size". We're going to show that for each number between 0 and 1, there exists a number between 0 and 2, and vice versa.

1. Pick any number between 0 and 1.
2. Multiply it by 2.
3. You now have a number between 0 and 2.
4. Vice versa, pick any number between 0 and 2
5. Divide it by 2.
6. You now ave a number between 0 and 1.

This works both for the case of rational and real numbers. We just constructed a so-called bijection between the intervals \[0,1\] and \[0,2\].
Everyone's already pointing out the "correct" way to define size of infinite sets, but what many people are leaving out, which is very, VERY important, is that there is actually more than one way to define size. With your question, you're mixing up two different notions of size, namely [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\)) and [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). This is the problem that people not into math often forget about when they spout this fact about some infinities being larger than others. If we want the discussion to have any meaning at all, we must first agree on what we mean by size.

To ELI5, think of it like this. It's just like how there are different ways of defining the size of an object. You can take its height, width, volume, or mass. For the purposes of analogy, let's focus on volume and mass. If object A has more volume than object B, that doesn't mean that object A is necessarily heavier than object B, especially if they're made up of materials with different densities, like [steel and feathers](https://youtu.be/N3bEh-PEk1g). To say that object A has a larger size than object B, it requires a clarification for whether you're comparing their mass or their volume. You'll encounter this need for clarification in baking recipes, for example, where both volume and mass are used simultaneously to specify the amounts of certain ingredients. If the recipe calls for more flour than sugar, what does it really mean by that?

Now, consider what you meant in the post title, when you said that the amount of numbers in the interval [0,2] is larger than the amount in the interval [0,1]. This notion of size is analogous to what we mean by "volume", in the sense that the interval [0,2] takes up more space on the number line than [0,1] does. In math, we call this notion of size the ["measure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\)) of the set. It is a little too complicated to explain in detail for an ELI5, but loosely speaking, it is a way of talking about how much space a set of objects take up, analogous to what everyday people refer to as volume.

Now compare that to how everyone in this comments section is explaining the notion of size for infinite sets. Notice how none of their explanations bring up this idea of how much space the sets take, or if they do mention it, they emphasize that it isn't important. That's because they are NOT talking about "measure", but rather ["cardinality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). Cardinality is more about comparing how many individual items constitute the whole object. You can kind of think of this in terms of mass, though the analogy is not quite as good as that between volume and measure. To make the analogy work, you'd have to think of mass as the amount of protons and neutrons inside of an object, which is a little silly, but it's the closest analogy we really have, given how much weirder cardinality is than measure. But basically, if two objects have the same number of protons+neutrons, then they have the same mass (we ignore electrons, since they weigh basically nothing in comparison). For ease of conversation, let's refer to protons and neutrons collectively as particles from now on. Hold on tight, as this is about to push the limits of ELI5.

Alright, so how do we determine that two objects have the same mass, when defined in this silly way? Well, we could count up their particles, and then compare the numbers to see if they're equal. This is fine for everyday objects, since any given object in the physical world only has finitely many particles, so you can count them up just fine. What screws this up is if, for some reason, you have an object that has an infinite number of particles. Then, you can not just count them up. What you can do instead, is take one particle from object A, one particle from object B, pair them up, and then set the pair aside. You then take the next particle from A, the next from B, pair them up, and set the pair aside again. If given an infinite amount of time, you can complete this process until one of the objects run out of particles. If in the end, object B still has particles left over while object A is depleted, then we know that object B started out with more particles, so object B has a larger cardinality than object A. If they both run out at the same time, then the two objects have the same cardinality. Notice how this method circumvents having to count anything. 

This is what people mean when they say that one infinity is larger than another. In terms of cardinality, there are more numbers between 0 and 1 than there are integers, for exactly this reason. When you try to pair up the integers with the numbers in [0,1], you'll run out of integers before you run out of numbers in [0,1]. I won't go over this since it's already been explained by others in the thread, so for a good explanation of this, refer to /u/eightfoldabyss 's reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/h9yh9l/eli5_there_are_infinite_numbers_between_0_and_1/fuzmshh/).

So yes, one infinity can be larger than another, but what I really want you to take away from my reply is that there is more than one way to express the size of a set. Once you accept this, the fact that one infinity is larger than another will feel a lot less strange.
Your intuition for size comes from the structure of intervals, rather than the amount of elements they have. The intervals [0, 1] and [0, 2] have the same quantity of points, because you can pair them up. However, the interval [0, 2] is twice as long as the interval [0, 1]. The particular elements within [0, 2] and their relation to each other is what gives it that length, not the amount of elements.
The concept of size that’s used for infinite sets is basically this: Two sets are the same size if you can pair the members from one up with the members of the other with no leftovers. You can do that with the two sets OP asked about, so they’re actually the same size. But you can’t do that with the set of all integers and the set of all numbers between 0 and 1.
Well, two things are happening here. There are different kinds of infinities, some of which are larger than others. However, the number of real numbers between 0 and 1 is the same as the number of real numbers between 0 and 2.

You can prove this second one by creating what's called a bijection - showing that for every member of group A there is exactly one member of group B. This is easier to show with another set but it does carry over into this situation.

Let's say we're comparing every even number with every even AND odd number. It seems like the second one should be larger, right? But if we take every even number and divide it by two, we go from 0, 2, 4, 6... to 0, 1, 2, 3... That second set sure looks like the set of all even and odd numbers.

The same thing applies here. If you take every real number between 0 and 2, and divide them all by 2, you get every real number between 0 and 1.

There is also a way to show that some infinities are larger than others. This one is a bit harder to picture, but imagine a list of every real number between 0 and 1. This is every rational number, but also every irrational, every transcendental, every number that is between all of those forever. It's not obvious how you could sort such a list but let's say you just write down the numbers randomly.

Well, this is a list that you can order 1, 2, 3 etc. Sure, it's infinite, but so is the list of counting numbers. Right now there's no obvious problem; if they're both infinite, you're good to say that they're the same size.

However, we can do something that breaks this. Let's create a new number; the rule is that it's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on forever. This is definitely a real number, meaning it should be on the list, but it's definitely not on the list, since it's different from every number on the list in at least one place. Even if you added this new number to the list, you could just do this again.

What we've done is shown that, even if we use all the counting numbers, all infinity of them, we can still create numbers that are not on that list and for which there is no matching number. There are numbers left over after we've used all the counting numbers. Even though they're both infinite, there are *more* real numbers than there are counting numbers.

I hope this makes sense.
This is actually pretty interesting because there are the same number of numbers between 0 and 1 and 0 and 2. Vsauce did videos that explains this much better than I can in a reddit comment: [Banach–Tarski Paradox, directly related to question](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA), and [How To Count Past Infinity](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)
The rule is that if you can match up each number of two sets 1:1, then sets have to be the same size.  E.g. the set of whole numbers between 1 and 10 is the same size as the set of EVEN numbers between 2 and 20.  Why? Because you multiply each number in the first set by 2 and you get exactly the second set.  1 gets matched to 2, 2 get matched to 4,.... and so on.

In the same way the infinite (0, 1) set matches the set (0, 2) by multiplying each number by 2.
[removed]
Those two infinities are the same size. For every number between 0 and 1, you can multiply it by 2 to get a number between 0 and 2. This transformation covers all numbers between 0 and 2, with no missing numbers. There are other infinities that are larger, and it’s not possible to map to larger infinities from smaller infinities in this way.
[removed]
I don't know if its relevant but if you have infinite 10$ bills and on the other hand have infinite 100$ bills, their value will be the same.
This is why i love mathematics, still not good at it.
It is interesting how many misconceptions about infinities, or about numbers more generally, stem from the mistake idea that infinity is a member of the set of integers, rather than its cardinality.  So endless mistaken stuff happens because people have the idea that there are arithmetic operations on integers (or rationals, reals) that yield “infinity”.   The most common is the idea that n/0=inf, but also concepts which boil down to there being an n such that n+1=inf or distinguishable infinities such that 2.inf_1=inf_2 where inf_1<inf_2 (or at least not equal, and distinguishable).  All of these fail for endless reasons, but explaining why they fail is hard unless you can convince people of the bijection with integers (see above)
BBC Crowd Science covered this topic and used the "infinite hotel" to explain how one infinity can be bigger than another https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080nt5p
I'm a little late to the party but here's how I explained this to my daughter. 

Imagine we're putting all the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, in a big basket. (It's very big, yes!). There's so many numbers we can't really count them! That's kind of what infinity means. That even if you had all the time in the world, you couldn't count them. 

Now let's imagine a different basket. We're putting the even numbers in: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and so on. 

How many numbers are in that basket? Could we count them? Even if we had a lot of time we'd never run out of numbers to count! 

But are there *more* numbers in the first basket? After all, the first basket has all the numbers, the second basket has only the even numbers. How can we tell, since we can't count them? 

Well, maybe we can play a matching game. If every number in the first basket has a friend in the second, then there must be the same amount. If we run out of friends, then some number in the first basket will be lonely and won't have a friend to match with :(

So we can match '1' from the first basket with '2' from the second, 2 with 4, 3 with 6, 4 with 8, 6 with 12... have we run out of friends yet? We can keep going right? How long can we keep going for? Forever?? That means there will always be a friend in the second basket to match up with the first! :)

But if we can match numbers between baskets there must be the same amount of numbers in each! Otherwise we'd run out of friends in the second to match up to the first. But we never run out. So there's the same amount, infinity, in each!

One weird thing though is we can make a basket with some lonely friends. Suppose our third basket has *fractions* in it, all the fractions. There will be some lonely fractions. This is because we can't match them all up even if we try really hard. That's because we know how to start the list of regular numbers (1 2 3 4 5...) but what's the first fraction? No matter where we start the list we're forgetting one. 

So there's two kinds of infinity: the regular numbers (we call them natural numbers) that are just 1, 2, 3, 4, and the 'rational' numbers, which are fractions (ratios).
It's about mappings. A mapping is a one-to-one equivalence between two sets.   
If you can find a way to "partner up" all the values from both sets so no matter what value you pick from either set, there's exactly one value in the other that you can pair it with, you have a mapping.   
   
So if we take a value from [0-1], and multiply by 2, that uniquely identifies a value in [0-2]. And conversely, if you take a value from [0-2] and divide it by 2, you'll find a unique value from [0-1].   
This is what we mean when we say they are the same size, it means that we can find a rule to convert values from one set to the other.
Look at the positive whole. We can count them. 1, 2, 3, 4, ... No matter what positive whole number you want to reach, you'll reach it eventually by counting. This set contains a 'countable infinite' number of elements.

Now look at all the (real) numbers between 0 and 1. Real numbers are all the numbers you can think of. Fractions like 1/2, but also numbers like 91,37382930401... and so on, with every digit being completely random. There is no way to count all those numbers in a similar way as for the whole numbers. (There is a way to count fractions, but I won't go into detail.) 

There is a finite amount of numbers in between two whole numbers. For example: in between 1 and 5, you have 2, 3 and 4. The same logic doesn't apply for real numbers between 0 and 1. There is still an infinite amount of numbers in between 0,3 and 0,48485938278... which can't be counted in a structured way, i.e. counting systematically with you eventually reaching any number in between those two. The set of real numbers contains an 'incountable infinite' number of elements. So there are more real numbers than there are whole numbers.

For the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 and the set between 0 and 2, it's easy to see they contain an equal amount of numbers as another comment has pointed out already. 

Fun fact: There is an infinite amount of levels of infinity, the number of whole numbers and the number of real numbers are the two lowest levels.
As you might have heard let's see a circle is made up from infinite amount of points, but you can still draw a circle thats 2x bigger than the other one, same applies for other figures as well.
I always thought about this as a perspective thing. imagine you are standing in a room that is infinite in size. You are next to the wall, you see the wall on your left and it stretches to infinity. that is 0 to 1. now think of it as a hallway. you see both walls. they both stretch to infinity.
Infinity is not a number but a concept. So while two counts are both infinite they are not the same, they just share the same concept of being infinite. So what you are saying is not contradicting each other.
I  could add to the fine descriptions here, but if you've got 24 minutes this is still my favorite descriptions of what you are asking and it stays pretty ELI5 friendly the whole time.

VSauce - How to count past infinity

[https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)
There are not more numbers between 0 and 2 than there are between 0 and 1.

There is more distance between 0 and 2 than there is between 0 and 1.
A professor once told me that "infinite" isn't a value. It's more of a state. That's why infinite + 2 = infinite and so on. Even infinite + infinite = infinite.
What you're describing are points in a line.  You can divide 0-1 as many times as you can divide 0-2.  We simply use particular points in that line to mentally map what those points mean.

Neither set of numbers have "more" or "less" numbers; rather, our usual points of reference only make it seem that way, like an optical illusion fools our brains into seeing things in a way we can relate to.  In your example, there really is no more, or fewer, possible number of rational numbers in between. That's, fundamentally, what the word "infinite" represents; that there just isn't a mathmatical way to create a "smallest" unit of numbers.
It’s not, they’re both the same size. 

For any number between 0 and 2 you can just divide that by 2 and it’ll be between 0 and 1. 

Same would work if you did 0 and 3 or 0 and 1,000,000 etc.
In math, when dealing with infinite sets, our traditional notion of a set being "bigger" or "smaller" in terms of having more members breaks down. Even though there are demonstrably "more" numbers between 0 and 2 than there are between 0 and 1, the two sets are the same "size" as far as how many numbers are in the two sets. 

&#x200B;

Think of it this way: you have a 1-inch long piece of Play-Doh. You take that piece of Play-Doh and stretch it out to 2 inches. Even though your piece of Play-Doh is twice as long as it was before, it's still made up of the same "amount" of Play-Doh because you didn't add more pieces of Play-Doh or cut out any -- all you did was stretch.
Infinite basically means more than we can count, so...
Imagine you can only count as high as 5. Anything more than that would count as "infinite"

So if you have 6 marbles in a bag, there are (in this context) infinite marbles.
But say you had 20 marbles in a bag, we know for a fact 20>6, but from the perspective of the man who can count no higher than 5, they both are infinite.

Now take this concept and just scale it way up!
How would there be more numbers  between 0 and 2 in the grand scheme if its infinite?
An infinite set is the same size if you can set a bijection (a one-to one correspondence between the two sets). For example the natural numbers (1,2,3,4...) is of the same size as the integers(....-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...) because you can set it up where for every odd number goes to a positive, and every even number goes to a negative
(1,1) (2,-1) (3,2) (4,-2) (5,3) (6,-3)..... 
since the natural numbers never end, every positive and negative number will be accounted for, thus they are the same “size”. The real numbers are actually a larger size of infinity that is a bit more complicated but for a similar reason the set of [0,1] is actually the same size as all the real numbers. The tangent function is often used to create a bijection between [0,1]~real numbers
Think about this as a range instead of numbers. One to Two can get infinitely smaller, but is set in its limits. To put it in a metaphor, if you are pointing at one direction, the universe in that direction could have nearly anything but is still limited to what is in that direction. Now if you point in the opposite direction you get the same result but just in a different direction. If both are pointed at, you get a larger range but will still be theoretically infinite.

Infinity is not a number it's a concept of never ending. It basically impossible to fully grasp
The way I think of it. Whatever number you put between 0 and 1, let’s say 0.2636493, when you expand to 0 to 2 you can have that same number plus one, 1.2636493. For all of the infinitive numbers between 0 and 1 there is a matching decimal between 1 and 2.
The infinite numbers between 0 and 2 is not bigger than the infinite number between 0 and 1. They are both infinite, they are even closer to be equal.
When regarding infinities of different sizes in math, the numbers vary by the size of it's *set*. Set, In math is a collection of objects (elements/numbers)

The amount of real numbers do not end, so there are an Infinite amount of numbers, that is what's called an "uncountably infinite" set of numbers.                
Such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], etc from the numbers 1 through 10 in this set, there are 10 objects
          
If you take the amount of only even numbers from the set of infinite real numbers, you have a countably smaller infinite set of numbers because while the amount of even numbers is still *infinite* , the set of numbers which make the infinity is less than it would be with all real numbers.         
So like the last paragraph we go 1 through 10 but with only even numbers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] from the numbers 1 through 10 in this set, there are only 5 objects

           
So theoretically a "subset" of numbers like evens, odds, ordinal numbers, prime numbers, are all infinite in size, but each subset has a different amount of objects/numbers in them
Imagine you had an infinite number of blueberry pies. Now imagine that all of those pies had been cut into 8 slices. You have both infinite pies and infinite slices but you clearly have more slices than pies.
One professor always told me to explain things with words a 8yo would understand, no matter what. So here I go.
You try to solve your infinite dilemma with finite mathematics. Infinite math starts with the notion of limits and Calculus.  Between 0 and 1 there are an uncountable number of elements, and so it is between 0 and 2. You can only affirm that [0,1] is within [0,2], and both are uncountable, which means both contains a never ending number of elements that tends to infinity. When the uncountable notion comes in it means that you leave finite mathematics to go into infinite mathematics. At that moment your mindset must change.  - me PhD Math
Infinity can’t be measured in a way that you can visualize.  You think that 0-2 is twice as long as 0-1 because that’s how it’s visualized.  Infinity is measured differently, and it’s not the “same size”.  Two infinite sets can be “equinumerous” if there exists a one-to-one function between them.  In your example, y=2x over [0,1] maps to [0,2] therefore the sets are equinumerous.
Math professor here. There are a lot of good technical answers already here, but here's a way to get some intuition: Imagine a piece of rubber band that is 1 inch long, and then stretching that it to be 2 inches long. The same strip of rubber that can cover either of the two lengths, and any position along the 1 inch unstretched band (which we think of as a number between 0 and 1) corresponds to exactly one position along the 2 inch stretched band (which we think of as a number between 0 and 2) and vice versa.

To a mathematician, this correspondence (which others on this thread have called by its technical term: a bijection) between the collection of numbers between 0 and 1 and the collection of numbers between 0 and 2 is how we tell that the collections have the same "number of numbers" (or "cardinality"). 

To see this kind of correspondence or bijection in a more familiar setting, imagine that you and I each have a bag of M&Ms, and we wonder if they bags contain the same number of pieces. We could each count the number of M&Ms and compare results, but another way to do it would be to each line up our M&Ms in a long row side-by-side, effectively pairing up each of my M&Ms with one of yours and vice versa; if each of my M&Ms matches with one of yours and each of yours matches with one of mine, then we have a bijection! And we say that the number of M&Ms or the cardinality of our M&M collections are the same.

The rubber band analogy is a similar way of creating a bijection between the numbers between 0 and 1 and the numbers between 0 and 2. More precisely, I'll take any number x between 0 and 1 and pair it with 2\*x, which will be between 0 and 2. Every number between 0 and 1 gets a match between 0 and 2, and every number between 0 and 2 is matched with a number between 0 and 1, so we have a bijection, and we say that the collections of numbers have the same cardinality.

Setting up these bijections may seem like an overly complicated way of determining when numbers are equal, but they give mathematicians a consistent way of comparing the "sizes" of collections of numbers (or M&Ms). There are some trippy ideas that result from this like the idea that there are just as many whole numbers as there are rational numbers (fractions), but that there are more irrational numbers than there are rational ones! Theorems like these rely on less intuitive reasoning than thinking about rubber bands (at least less intuitive for me).

ELI5 Why is 12 hour time even taught? Wouldn’t it just be easier to remember 13:00 instead of 1:00pm?

12 hour time is a *very* ancient system that traces back to the Mesopotamian empires.

They had a cultural fixation on the number 12, used a base-12 numerical system, and divided up most things into 12ths whenever possible - including day and night.

The 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night system spread throughout Europe and the Middle East and has defied multiple attempts to change it over the centuries.
Dividing the 24-hour clock into two periods came about because of sundials. For a couple thousand years, sundials were the main method of timekeeping, so you could only keep accurate time during half the day. The changeover happened at noon (at the sun's highest point) because it's an observable, universal frame of reference.

Mechanical clocks kept the division because it's simpler to make a 12-hour clock than a 24-hour one. Obviously the system is obsolete in the age of electronic timekeeping, but it's still a well-established system that most people are familiar with.
[removed]
[removed]
Clocks, for about 600 years, were principally mechanical and had what amounts to an analog display: a circular dial.

Making clocks which cycled through in twelve hours was easier, the twelve-hour dial was easier to read, and everyone *knew* whether it was morning or night so there was really no difficulty with them.

There were, from time to time, other sorts of clocks built: some which had 24-hour dials, some of which showed weekdays, some of which ran counterclockwise.  But most clocks worked the same way.

Now that it is cheaper - at least in the sorts of quantities we produce - to make electronic clocks with character-based displays, the twelve-hour format may well die out.

Give it another hundred years.  We'll see.
Most of the world does use 24 hour time (at least when writing down times). 12 hour time has some advantages (quicker to say, can be more easily shown on an analog clock face), but it's probably mostly historic reasons, just like how the US still uses imperial units.

Analogue clocks only have 12 hours on them in most circumstances, and teaching them is a good way to introduce the concept of dividing hours into 60 minutes.

Hi Everyone,

I'm locking this post, I understand that this is pretty much always an unpopular decision. This question, which is fundamentally 'why is the 12 hour time system used, and how does it compare to 24 hour systems", has drawn an enormous number of rule breaking responses in addition to a few well thought out and well phrased ones.

Particularly we don't allow opinion based answers (rule 5) and anecdotal answers (rule 3), so any top level comment either (solely) sharing an opinion on the systems, or sharing an anecdote of how x country, or your experience with y system made you feel unfortunately needs to be removed.

Rather than continuously remove 95% of the comments as per the rules I'm opting to lock the post so that you can still see the answers and gain the knowledge, but won't break the rules yourself sharing your experience (we know we are strict).

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope you still get a good dose of education from the discussion remaining.
Why is 12 hour time taught?

Why do the British and Americans use Imperial and not metric?

Answer - habit and resistance to change.

I think 12 was easier to put in analog clocks than 24. In digital age, 12 mostly feels redundant
[removed]
my problem with the 12h system is when its 12:00 or 0:00. Its not intuitive. 12pm and 12am could both be 12:00 or 0:00 and it would make sense either way.
[removed]
One reason is because it is only very recently that we started carrying phones, or even digital watches to tell time.  Until a few decades ago, if you wanted to know the time, you had to have an analog watch or clock, and it's much easier to tell the time on a clock face with only 12 divisions than it is on one with 24 divisions.  Then if you are confused with whether it is 6:00 PM or 6:00 AM you just look out the window.
Here in America, we're 100% used to it with starting over after 12 each time. 

So in my mind, every time I hear something like 21:00 hundred hours, I have to translate back to my base. 

Then, I have to think it through to be sure I translated correctly.

Is that a reason to keep it this way?

Not at all. 

I'd say we'd adapt pretty quickly, but it's hard to reset people's day to day use of language.
[removed]
[removed]
Not necessarily. If you're not used to the 24-hour system, you might not instantly recognize that 16:00 is 4PM and 21:00 is 9PM. We divide a day in two 12 hours segments because it is the "default" amount of time day and night last during an equinox. This practice subsisted for a while since it is easier to display time on a mechanical clock with 12 numbers on it instead of 24. The 24 hour system is quite recent and often referred to as "military time".

Both systems are viable, it just depends which one you're used to.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
Because it's not worth investing the time and effort into fixing something that almost never causes significant issues. 

This is basically the same as the metric/imperial argument. It simply isn't worth the trouble it would cause in the short term. Would it make things (slightly) easier for everyone in the long term? Yes. Would it cause a massive pain in the ass now? Also yes.
[removed]
No, it’s way harder for me to subtract 12 from every time after 12 to know the time, tbh. But tbf, I didn’t learn the 24 hour thing. I also don’t like 24:00 and 00:00 being the same time. Am and pm is plenty simple.
I love 24-hour format. It allows me to look at the time and say nerd things.  
  
for examples,  
13:37  = 1337 = Leet o'clock  
17:01 = Star Trek o'clock  
etc.
Wouldn't only remembering 12 numbers be easier than 24?
Because we still use 12 hour time. We can't stop teaching kids something that is still commonly used. It's not only part of many languages (you don't say 15 o clock, you say it's 3 o clock), but it's also part of analog clocks. You don't want you kids to not understand how an analog clock works, do you?
Because analogue clocks are still very fashionable and 24 hour analogue clock faces are terrible. You either have a clock that is running at half speed and 6oclock looks like 3oclock or you need to somehow indicate that this is the second time round for the day, both solutions not being very stylish.
Analogue clocks only have 12 hours on them. While digital clocks are more prevalent these days, there are still enough analogue clocks and watches around that being able to read them is handy.

ELI5: Military officers swear to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the President
Can the military overthrow the President if there is a direct order that may harm civilians?
A lot of the Constitution is set up to protect the peaceful transfer of power. Basically, the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections.

So while the armed forces swear to the Constitution, not the president, the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods (impeachment and the 25th amendment) by which a bad, crazy, sick etc. president can be removed and replaced. Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.

Having the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief. One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally. His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens.

This fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome, when (for example) Julius Caesar was able to become ~~emperor~~ dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally, rather than to the Roman Republic. 

*Edit:* Thank you for the gold! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history. This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes.

In theory, military commanders are supposed to disobey an order that is unconstitutional: no need for a coup.

In theory. Of course, if said commanders back the President anyway, that won't make any difference -- and it's not as if there's anyone else in a position to stop the military. This is the problem with a standing army, one which the US, in its early history, actively tried to avoid (hence the Second Amendment, which speaks of the need for a "well-regulated militia"). You should probably cross your fingers and hope we never have to find out.

Suppose the President suddenly announces that all presidential elections are cancelled, and that he is President for life. A blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act. What could happen?

Well, if things work correctly, either Congress or the Supreme Court, or both, will put a stop to that. For example, Congress could impeach the President -- effectively putting him on trial, and if found guilty, removing him from office. But what if things go really, horribly wrong. Perhaps Congress refuses to impeach. Maybe the President and those around him have been using personal and direct threats against Congressmen and their families (Hitler did something similar to ensure his rise to the top). For whatever reason, that mechanism has broken down, and those few brave souls who dare speak out are silenced, perhaps arrested or simply dismissed. Can the military stage a coup?

To be honest, if things have got to that stage, then the rule of law has irretrievably broken down anyhow: doing nothing at all would simply allow the totalitarian dictatorship to establish itself. And I would imagine an awful lot of civil unrest, as civilians opposed to the President protest and are met with those sympathetic to him, and that might be serious enough for the military to impose martial law, simply to restore some kind of order.

But here we're talking about a military coup, and military coups are not often good news. If you're lucky, a military coup might succeed in removing the dictatorship, and returning the country to civilian rule as quickly and painlessly as possible. If you're unlucky, a military coup simply replaces a civilian dictatorship with a military dictatorship.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold.
US Army Officer here.

It's as simple as it sounds, but at the same time quite brilliant. Our oath is different than the enlisted soldiers (the actual fighters) in that obeying orders is not part of our oath. We are only required to use the Constitution and our principles as a guide when deciding if we should follow an order. 

By virtue of how the oath is written, we swear to place the Constitution above the President. This is designed to prevent the President from being able to subvert the Constitution via the military. The reality that an order may not be followed by subordinate officers is a form of checks and balances that is designed to prevent tyrannical, unethical, or just plain dumb efforts from getting off the ground. 

What makes it brilliant is that the US military learned long ago that decentralized execution, meaning empowering subordinates to make decisions, works very well in combat situations as well as operational design and our central leaders are willing to accept the risk that comes along with that approach.

Of note, enlisted soldiers have an obligation not to obey unlawful orders which makes them accountable for their actions. But officers have an obligation to disobey even those that could be classified as a lawful orders if it violates the aforementioned criteria.
Most people who have never served in the armed forces (the vast majority of the present population of adult Americans) have no idea how strongly our veterans feel about the oath of enlistment or oath of commission that they took when they joined our armed forces.

I am 66 years old.  When I was a boy, virtually all adult men were veterans of WWII or the Korean War.  Those veterans all shared a common military experience.  They were patriotic, and they expected certain behavior and attitudes out of other adults.  With the upheavals associated with the Vietnam War, and the cessation of the Draft in 1972, this is no longer the case.  Most adults today do not consider our armed forces to be "part and parcel" of the civilian population, and have never served as a soldier.  They do not understand, because they never experienced military boot camp and training, that our servicemen and servicewomen are taught that they are to *defend the Constitution.*  Most of us cannot imagine a situation where a tyrant might attempt to seize control of the United States.  Conditioned by a recent history of presidents who attempt to do as they please through Executive Orders, many people believe the power of the president is not checked by Congress or the Supreme Court.  This is not the case, and don't think for a second that the men and women of our armed forces are not acutely aware of this fact.  As a young Marine sergeant, I saw teen-aged Marines outraged and offended when they believed General Haig (the Secretary of State at that time) was trying to take control of the government when President Ronald Reagan was shot.  They were shouting, "He's not next in the line of succession!  It's the VICE-PRESIDENT!"  Haig later apologized, but as a general officer and the *Secretary of State,* for pete's sake, he should have known better.

This little story is *exactly* why we need to continue to teach Civics and Government in high school.

Americans should trust their armed forces more.  Soldiers are CITIZENS, not robots.  In my opinion, the Republic is in no danger from its armed forces.  (Plus, the civilian population is armed to the teeth with 300 million firearms.)
If you look at it objectively, the military could easily overthrow the civilian government and install its own leader.  We have the monopoly on weaponry.  It happens in other countries.

However, our democracy is safeguarded from this by several things:

Some folks may not realize this but one of the reasons we have ROTC on college campuses is to ensure that future military leaders will always have a connection to the general public.  This is to balance the effects of a dedicated military academy, by its makeup, tends to lean more tribal.

Also, we also have another safeguard by maintaining separate branches of the Armed Forces instead of having a unified military command.  In the third world, it is quite common to have one branch side with the government while another sides with the rebels.  Checks and balances, if you will.

As a former service member with a conscience, I would not follow an order if I thought it would be against my moral compass. We had discussions about how we would react if ordered to act against our own counties people and 10/10 people I spoke with would not entertain the thought of helping with a strike against civilians. 


The people on this thread have explained the legal situation of this question pretty well, but, historically, governments that come from a military coup are ALWAYS worse than the one they replace, so I wouldn't suggest hoping for this situation to occur. 
There is no constitutional allowance for the military overthrowing the President.  Doing this would be an illegal coup.

The military is bound to disobey illegal orders, however.  Disobeying an illegal order is not illegal.
I don't know about OCS, but other routes to a commission as an officer include plenty of ethics and morals classes in which they discuss this exact topic, among many other moral obligations. A large part of the answer lies within the exhilarating and suspenseful "Naval Officer's Guide", but I'll spare you those details as it's not quite as exhilarating as I may have talked it up to be. In short: an officer serves his/her crew and superiors, as well as the constitution. If they receive an unlawful, and/or immoral order by their standards, they're *morally obligated* to follow up on it/question it rather than blindly follow, for the sake of their crew's safety and the upholding of the constitution; albeit, you better be more sure of the immorality of that order than you've ever been before because the UCMJ does not take disobeying orders lightly.

This is the oath a soldier takes when they enlist.

So help me God." (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).

This is the oath an officer takes when he becomes an officer.

> "I, _____ (SSAN), having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God." (DA Form 71, 1 August 1959, for officers.)

On careful reading, you will notice that true faith and allegiance are sworn to the Constitution and not any particular government office. The only mention of obeying orders (or the President for that matter) is in the enlistment oath, and that it is specifically subject to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So any order in conflict with the Constitution, regulations or the UCMJ is invalid and must not be followed.

There is no provision for overthrowing the President in there. By my understanding the correct course of action when presented with an unconstitutional order is just not to follow it. Dealing with a rogue President is the job of Congress and the Supreme Court, not the army.

This is probably a good move, because they are both a lot better at avoiding collateral damage than the army is.
There are much better ways to replace the President than the military doing it. Trust me, you don't want us doing it, it sets an awful precedent and the Constitution already provides methods for legally removing the President.

Can overthrow the government: Yes, the ability to do so is present.

Will based upon an "unlawful" order? Likely not.

The president does not usually control the military via direct order, although they do have the authority to do so. Instead the president confers with military leaders (Join Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense) to find solutions that meet the goal of the president. These military leaders are in a way a check on the president's authority itself, because typically they would not suggest something illegal. These members could also refuse the order although at that point they could potentially be subject to arrest and prosecution so it would be paramount that the order was obviously unlawful.

For example, the president might want to shut down a riot. Assuming local police can not or will not do it, the military could be used. The president wouldn't tell the JCS to "kill everyone who disobeys the order to leave the area", and they wouldn't suggest it. Instead the level of force used would be just enough (hopefully) to gain compliance. Although individual soldiers might exceed the necessary force required and use lethal force.

Obviously President Trump inspires questions like these in some portion of the population, to put it plainly, a military coup is very very unlikely. The vast majority of enlisted soldiers (which make up the bulk of the armed forces) like and support Trump something to the tune of 7/10 enlisted. In order to convince the military at large that force was required to dispose the president he would have to do something so extreme that I can barely think of a few examples. Shy of dropping a nuke on the states, a military coup is unlikely. 

Similarly people wonder why the military didn't rebel when Adolf Hitler started ordering the extermination of Jews and various other minority groups. First, most soldiers were unaware. Given todays internet and streaming video it seems unlikely something like an extermination camp would go unnoticed. Second the soldiers were trained to see those people as "the enemy". Killing a person isn't easy and there are a lot of coping mechanisms, granted it is easier if they are shooting at you, and much harder if it is innocent civilians in particular your fellow countryman. Third the soldiers don't generally make a decision on whether or not to do something. If all of the superior officers sent an order, it becomes easy for the soldier to rationalize the order as "a necessary evil".
As a prior enlisted Marine, the President is your boss, officer or not.  He has direct authority over Marines and can send us anywhere for a limited time without approval from congress.  That's the first part.  

Second part, think of overthrowing him as the same thing as mutiny on a ship or secession from the US.  If you're gonna do it, you better be right and you better have the power to do so.  It would be the equivalent of fighting England for Independence.  Win and be right and it's gravy.  Lose and you're spam. 
While everyone answers are correct, in practice it is murkier. Laws are based on interpretation and what courts deem to be legal. If this interpretation hasn't happened you get a gray area. Many people find the orders of the President justified while some do not. Ultimately rank will decide action.

When British troops shot civilians in the Boston Massacre, it wasn't an order to "kill civilians". They were staged there to prevent and insurrection. The British soldiers were heckled, harassed, before rocks started being thrown. Next thing you know a fight breaks out, a someone discharges his weapon, but nobody knows who, and now a British Officer gives the order to launch a volley into the crowd. 

That's how it plays out in real life. 
throughout most of our nations history our military has been capable of staging a coup... but it never has... even when Truman relieved MacArthur during the Korean conflict... not even a whisper of rebellion.

I think that in the age of scandal, too many of us fail to respect the fact that professional, moral, ethical SELFLESS service is the norm in our military.

The vast majority of our military would not follow an illegal order no matter the personal cost or their political leanings.  Do you remember in 2006 when the senior lawyers of each branch signed a joint statement rebutting John Yoo's torture memo and recommending to all military to refuse orders to engage in those techniques?  Yoo freakedand labeled their statement disloyal and tried to get himself appointed as supervisor of the military lawyers (he was rejected).

One more thing... it is the power of the American military that makes the President a world leader.  They do not need to, nor would they, stage a coup.  They simply (and properly) refuse to obey unconstitutional and illegal orders.  If the US military refuses to get involved, the President is reduced to a guy with a soap box and less physical power at his command than the Governor of South Dakota (or any of his 49 peers)

They also promise to obey lawful orders of those above them, which includes the President, so if the military decides to disobey him, there would be a discussion on the legality of the orders.

It sort of becomes a he-said-she-said, but for the most part, all military are taught to believe in the structure and hierarchy, so it would probably take a lot for the military to say "no". 

 There's also the reality of losing your paycheck (not to mention becoming an enemy of the administration!), and many military people I have met fall into two main camps - the first ones wanting a wife and family who go into that American debt cage - so your badass soldier is actually tied into the same life as many civilians - dependent on a paycheck and maxed out on debt.  And the risk of putting your family in danger.

Then there's this other large group of younger single soldiers without a financial care in the world (expenses like rent, food, clothing are covered from the start so you end up losing the need to budget your money - you can be broke and still eat, and sleep.)  I saw these guys also always go broke each month, because they bought brand new Camaros and Playstations, they drink like fish on the weekends and party hard at strip clubs.  Just as dependent on that next paycheck as the family guy.

So a lot of Soldiers are not the battle-hardened warriors that care only about saving the American people, rather they are quite motivated by that paycheck and what is perceived as a "warrior" lifestyle.  I don't think they would disobey orders from the very top, unless their immediate supervisors were also encouraging insurrection.

No, and it would be a really scary government if it could.  See Syria, Turkey, and Libya.  

If the president gives an unlawful order, the officers responsible for carrying it out could simply refuse, as they salute the constitution before the president.  

However, this is like killing someone in self defense.  Even if you are in the right, you are probably going to spend some quality time in jail until the lawyers sort things out.  

With all of that said, technically the military is a bunch of guys with guns and a chain of command.  They *could* just storm the white house and assume command.  However, the instant they go traitor, they are no longer members of the US military and are rebel insurgents attempting a coup.  

While their actions would be bold and arguably just, they will have started an open rebellion.  If they win, we are getting a rewrite the constitution overhaul.  If they lose, almost all will surely be executed on treason.  
The constitution is what gives the President power and us the power to elect a President. Thus the Constitution is more important than the president. 
I scanned but admittedly didn't read every comment, so perhaps I'll get downvoted, but I haven't heard any mention of article 88 of the UCMJ. This applies to not only active duty, but retired as well.

10 U.S. Code § 888 - Art. 88. Contempt toward officials
Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.
If everyone remembers correctly, Obama stacked the deck in his favor by firing military leaders/generals etc who he didn't think aligned with him. General Mattis was one of those Generals. 
I'm sure Trump will do the same and let the generals Obama favored go. 

Given that situation, it would be very very unlikely that any military officers would try what would be considered an act of treason or sedition. 

Additionally, the US military overwhelmingly supports Trump, unlike Obama whom they only had tepid support for. Therefore the scenario in OP's question was more likely to play out under Obama than it would under Trump
The military can stage a coup but honestly the President has far less involvement in the military than one might think. In fact Congress makes more decisions than the President does and they do a lot to road block our Generals. One of the many hats the Commandant of the Marine Corps wears, is professional Bullshitter and it's not a job he likes. Hardly any war dog enjoys having to fondle the balls of Congressmen and women. If given their way, they would depend on actual strategists and research without the approval of salty politicians. 

The military will of course harm civilians as a side effect of war, we all know that, but the president is not likely to order us to shoot a child in the head and rape their mother for kicks. Commander in Chief is mainly just a title. 
[removed]
That would be called a military coup. Happens a lot in 3rd world counties. 

What would happen here?

You've got a sizable percentage of the populace that believes in the president. And we're also one of the most heavily armed countries on earth. Only way peace is being kept after that is a prolonged period of martial law. So we'd basically end up extinguishing freedom altogether in order to "protect" it. 

Kind of perverse, no?
The president is the Commander in Chief of the military.  When you swear in to the  military, you also swear "that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice."

So, no, they can not legally overthrow the president.  But, they are also legally obligated to not follow orders that would be considered "unlawful"

*edit* OK, I get it - I quoted the wrong oath.  I will drop and give myself 50....  But, even with officers, trying to overthrow the CIC would be punishable by law and UCMJ
[removed]
Technically, yes.

Reality would play out differently though. 

The only way I see the military removing the president from power would come after the president uses other means (other agencies or PMCs) to carry out an aggressive maneuver on dissenting citizens. 
This would most likely result in commissioned officers resigning and enlisted folk refusing orders. That is until only the most dedicated are still left in, at which point the military would probably start enforcing those orders, even on their former unit members.

In a legal matter, military personnel could use Article 104 (aiding the enemy) as a justification for not following orders and overthrowing the prez if the actions and orders by the prez could be considered unlawful and actually be seen as an attack on the constitution (which supersedes the prez's orders) or its people.
To get to that point though, I feel, a lot of things had to have happened that would have already been addressed. 

The National Guard is a different story. Those Nasty Girls (seems to have a different menacing these days) have pulled the trigger multiple times on citizens, even other veterans. Those are the fuckers to watch out for as they have oaths that put more authority into the prez and govs hands.

While I'm not comfortable with the current prez, his Sec of Def is one bad mother who would slap the orange off the prez's face if such orders were to be given.
Mattis is a force of nature with a lot of respect for life, as long as you aren't trying to kill him.
We have the second amendment, the right to possess and use firearms. Our country is designed to allow the PEOPLE to overthrow the government, not the military. That is the entire point of 2A (second amendment). 


If the military were the only option of overthrowing government, it would be hard to overthrow the military when they inevitably become tyrannical. There are no checks and balances for a military dictatorship, thus a military coup would be an unfavorable option for the people.


That's the best ELI5 response you'll get in this thread.

My brother is an officer in the Army.  Many of my friends are veterans. Donald Trump winning the election could not have been a bigger excitement to everyone I know who is in the military or has served. 

After 8 years of being neglected and having their hands tied by Obama, the military is super excited and proud to have Trump as their commander in chief.  

If you were asking this question to see if the military would start a coup of the Trump administration, you'll be very dissapointed.
I never swore to the officers appointed over me or the president of the United States; I only swore to defend the constitution of the United States against both enemies foreign and domestic.

Where did you get harm civilians from?  Are you saying that the military should have overthrown Truman after Hiroshima?  We've nuked civilians, napalmed civilians, cluster bombed civilians, scorched civilians from the earth with chemical weapons, and tortured civilians to death.  It doesn't say shit in the constitution about harming civilians, from our own country or any other.  Use ctrl+f on the text of the constitution, see what you find!
Also, the UCMJ requires that military personal follow LAWFUL orders only. The excuse, "I was only following orders" is no excuse for violating the law in the execution of an order. Along with removing an excuse for following an illegal order, this law also gives a soldier the freedom (and, indeed, the duty) to refuse to follow such an order in the first place. 

The UCMJ may come in handy when national guard troops are ordered to fire on protestors, something I fully expect to happen in the near future.
Not just officers, but every member of the military (including enlisted)

Technically, we have a duty to disobey orders that go against certain things (Geneva convention etc)

For instance, if a senior officer ordered us to murder people, and we knew it would be murder, then we should refuse. Of course, it's a very grey area between doing what's right/treason.

We could overthrow the government, but it would be considered treason by the government in any case. So if you plan something like that, you'd better hope you succeed. We don't really have the authority to do so, just the firepower.

Refuse orders, yes. 

Overthrow the president, no. 

However, there is a constitutional way to remove the president under the 25th Amendment if the president is unfit for office. So if the president have a batshit crazy order (like a first strike nuke attack for no reason), that could be invoked. The military doesn't have a direct role in that, it involves the VP and cabinet. But the military would probably have a lot of sway with th cabinet. Similar for impeachment, which is instigated by congress. 
[removed]
Military personnel are trained to disobey orders that are illegal. Such as exterminating a village of non combatants in Afghanistan. 
No, but they would be expected to refuse the order. Only Congress can remove the President from office, and only after an impeachment.
The last 44th President had the lowest approval rating of the current Armed Forces enlisted and officer ranks of any in modern History. Just keep that in mind when you attempt to use the military for bashing the 45th
>Can the military overthrow the President if there is a direct order that may harm civilians?

No, they cannot. If the Courts of the US were to decide that a President cound no longer serve, they would use the legal system to enforce that order through the impeachment process. The President, if he tried to ignore the impeachment, would be arrested, not overthrown.

But, they can refuse to carry out an illegal order.
The idea is that you're serving the country and not a particular person, although that person (i.e. the President) may have a lot of power over you. 

However, when there is a conflict of interest between the Constitution and the President, e.g. the President ordered you to carpet bomb LA for his or her own amusement, you would be able to refuse to obey that order as it would be illegal, because the law doesn't allow mass-murdering people for shits and giggles. 


Take the German Wehrmacht during the Nazi period: they had to swear an oath to Adolf Hitler himself, not the German constitution or some other book of law. From that vantage point they would have had to comply to any order given by Hitler, regardless if that order was lawful or not.

I commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the USMC through a naval ROTC program. It was not only specified, but emphasized, that the oath military officers take does not mention swearing allegiance to the POTUS.

Officers are intended to be conduits of commanders intent, only if it is legal.
Maybe a little bit on the side, but I think that an american soldier always has a responsibility to act in accordance with e.g. the Geneva conventions and "the rules of war" in armed conflict - so obedience goes only so far in certain situations.  The US has signed all but Protocol II. (As Chancellor Merkel reminded Pres. Trump the other day regarding protection of victims of war). Ever since the Nuremberg trials a certain amount of responsibility has been placed on individuals even if under orders from higher up.  I guess for US military that at least pertains to situations of international  armed conflict, although it has been tried to blur the lines between outright warfare and "unlawful combatants" etc. Protocol II is to regulate internal armed conflict, and would cover situations with your own citizens and their treatment in that situation. The US, Iraq, Pakistan, Israel and Turkey have not signed this, so I guess your constitution and the US legal system rules more or less alone here.  

Not sure about international laws regarding possible threats to your own people as it seems that the US has withdrawn its signature to the International Crime Court/ICC in the Hague.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court

This court is meant to cover Crimes against humanity (like torture, deportations, apartheid, sexual violence etc etc on a large scale) and genocide, and areas outside conventional international wars, to protect people also from their governments. These are extremes of course, but the discussion made me think of this - national and international law, and the responsibilities and dilemmas military face. 

Anyhoo, the Nuremberg legacy, stolen off Wikipedia: 

The Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that "[c]rimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced." 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials#Legacy 
Atleast as a Naval Officer, we were taught the "Constitutional paradigm,"
Which establishes the order of precedence like this:

1) Constitution
2) Mission
3)"ship" (meaning your unit, squadron, etc)
4)"shipmate" (another person in your unit)
5) self

If there is a conflict at one level, the next highest level takes priority. 

Along with the constitutional paradigm, we're taught how and when to disobey an order.

1) If an order is unjust, you should first attempt to resolve this issue with the next highest level. If the issue goes all the way to the top and you still don't agree with the answer you should move on to:

2) Resign your commission/step down from whatever position you've been appointed to. If doing so would not solve the problem/make the problem worse, and you are without a shadow of a doubt convinced that you're morally right:

3) Make your decision to dissent/not carry out the order clear (I.e. in writing) and justify your reason for doing so. The people under your command should be notified of your decision, and it should be made clear to them that you are planning to disobey the order, giving them the opportunity to not follow you.

4) Accept the consequences. You may be relieved. You may be court martialed. You may be imprisoned. This is why you *need* to know, without any doubt, that you are justified in your actions. It will make it easier to accept the consequences.

Hopefully this answers your question.

Yes, but they would have to agree that "would harm citizens" is an objective truth, and not mass hysteria from the ill informed masses, as we are seeing with the protests of our current president. Now, however, if those protesters were to, say, start firebombing Washington and deemed enemies of democracy (which they would be), the military could rightfully stop them.

Because a country isn't defined at all by its leader; rather by its rules and laws.

That being said, you could always have a "The Rock" scenario where a bunch of elite soldiers goes rogue and tries to mess with the government.

In the United States Military, an enlisted soldier cannot be punished for refusing to obey an unlawful order from an officer of any rank. As a former Lance Corporal in the USMC, I had to follow ridiculous orders from Second Lieutenants to pick up cigarette butts or paint things and the like. But that is much different from him telling me to shoot unarmed civilians which I would never do and I cannot be reprimanded for refusing to follow that order. Getting to the question at hand. The military could never overthrow the President in practical terms because in addition to its illegality,there are built in measures to prevent this from happening. First, all military personnel change duty stations frequently. You only stay on one base for 3 or 4 years at the most. This prevents you from developing close personal relationships with other military members. Secondly, officers and enlisted cannot be real friends. This is called fraternization and it is a punishable offense under the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice). The net result is that you interact with strangers for the most part and know them really only by their rank and job description. Good luck trying to organize a coup with people you don't really know and risk a long prison sentence for mutiny by taking part in the overthrow of the President. It will never happen here, ever.
Not only CAN they, they are obligated and bound by oath to do so.  Every single member of the military takes this oath, regardless of rank.
[removed]
It stops them from marching on Washington themselves if Washington hasn't been blatantly breaking the constitution.
sidestepping your question, the oath to the constitution is a simple practical matter. the president changes all the time. potentially every 4 years. by swearing the oath to the Constitution instead of the president, it guarantees chain of command doesn't break down every time the office holder changes. it means the president has no legal standing to declare martial law post-elections, and that the enlisted can't legally abandon when the president changes.  
it doesn't matter if you joined under obama or trump. your oath is to America, not the President.  
[removed]
US Civil Servants also have to take a pledge as well, although in our case it is to "support and defend the Constitution."  As for how I view it, all levels of government are supposed to follow the Constitution, even the President, therefore we swear to support and defend it, rather than a specific administration.

Source: Am Civil Servant
No, that would be a violation of the constitution they swore to protect. The military is not allowed to make unilateral decisions like that, if the President was lawfully impeached by Congress and refused to leave then there might be potential there, but that likely won't ever happen in our time at least.

No, they are allowed to ignore the order. Any soldier in the military is allowed to ignore an order given by a superior if they feel it is an unlawful order.
No.  The military has a duty to follow lawful orders by the Commander in Chief.  The military is not to get involved with petty politics.   
Has anyone here actually considered how much damage America's enemies could immediately inflict on the US if armed impeachement or civil war on any scale broke out?

The US President knows it. The legislators and judiciaries know it. The top brass also know it.
The oath of office for the President is the same oath as I took as a Marine Officer.  Well, it sure as hell sounded the same. 
I actually talked to a girl who is in the military recently and presented her this same scenario. She pretty much said that she would still carry out orders even if it meant carrying out orders against her fellow American. She said it would deeply hurt her but she would do it. Obviously that was not the response I was hoping to hear. 
So my related question is. How effective is Trump/Bannon's message that Islam is not a religion and does not deserve protections. And their message of fear on the members of the military?

Can the Trump fear machine cause the military to side with the President and not the Constitution? Say if Trump convinces the military leaders that they are protecting the country by supporting his message of demonizing a whole segment of the country based on their religious beliefs and culture? First step, limit the rights of Muslims to travel. Limit their rights to jobs...

I'm happy to hear that many answers here are logical and explain how things are "supposed to work" with regards to the constitution and all that. But as we have seen from the election, logic was thrown out the window and fear/Alt-Right/Alt-News/Bannon won the day. Trump's twitter army has blown away the obstacles that would have torpedoed his run for higher office. The people have gone along and lowered their bar because they excuse his rants as "locker room talk".
ELI5 remembers u/bossgalaga
Hi Everyone,

We have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:

[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)

[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)

We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.

Additionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, "...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored." This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)

Thank you all for the kind words thus far. u/bossgalaga's friends and family certainly will appreciate them.
Anyone who would like to post a nice message may do so. We will manually approve any that pass rule 1 and are in good faith/on topic. You will still get a removal message it will go back up shortly (we cannot disable that feature for a single post)
RIP. This sub was one of the first I started reading on reddit way back when. He came up with a great idea that really showed how cool this website could be.
Anyone who has spent time on this sub knows that it can be one of the best on Reddit when it comes to fostering learning, and we wouldn't have that without /u/bossgalaga. I hope that we as a community can continue to keep that spirit alive and make this sub the best it can be, and hope that /u/bossgalaga will be proud of it.
RIP, u/bossgalaga, your subreddit has made me less stupid than I used to be <3
I've been a mod of ELI5 for 8 years, and have around since nearly the beginning.  I didn't interact a ton with bossgalaga, but when I did he was always excited about how the sub had progressed, and was happy that what he had started was a place where people could expect civility.  That's why our #1 rule has always been "Be Nice" and I think it makes for a great community.

I appreciate everyone who's contributed questions, explanations, or helped in maintaining the community every year, and I'm thankful that a community with this vision was created so we could all enjoy it.

RIP boss!  We'll keep the lights on here.
I remember finding this sub and thinking "Fuck, that's a really good idea, actually, this is EXACTLY what the internet should be for"

I've learned a shit-ton over the years here, and my life is more interesting and vibrant for it.

So, if u/bossgalaga 's family is reading, know that his life legacy included making one random dude in DC's life a little bit nicer and more fun.

That doesn't suck, at all.
Great post, great subreddit, great dude. Can we get this legend referenced in the ELI5 banner or something? 
Lest we forget
I started an ELI5 chatroom in our company chat where the employees can ask questions about things they want to know without being judged it feeling dumb, based on this subreddit. u/bossgalaga may not have invented the idea, but it's where I learned about it and it's made us an organization with better trained people as a result. You're leaving behind a great legacy, friend. RIP.
RIP u/bossgalaga. With almost 20MM members, at least his legacy lives on. Love the sub
Poor mate, terribly sad news. I still remember the thread where someone suggested it and bossgalaga made it happen. See you in Valhalla bud.
[It's crazy that he's passed, and we're receiving this news, exactly 10 years, and one day after the sub was founded.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/) 

Sorry to hear of his passing.
Wow... I didn't know /u/bossgalaga, but ELI5 has become a vital part of what I consider Reddit to be. They may be gone, but their contribution will live on.
RIP man. I love this sub. I was unable to follow my dream of being a teacher, and it allows me to scratch that itch while helping people out.
RIP. Truly gives my condolences to family and friends. I have learned many things here easily due to my circumstances. Very grateful for this community.
We are all smarter for having this sub available. Thank you
To their family my condolences, this subreddit has made myself, my wife, and our children smarter, and better for it. Not only that but it has also taught me how to think about my language and how to explain things in more layman terms while not being condescending.  


Thank You for one of the best subreddits.

Damn, that's awful. Rest in peace.
The best part of reddit, hands down. A community based in learning and kindness, what a legacy. You will be missed, but not forgotten.
I did not interact with this person, but have been in this sub for some years now. I can appreciate their contribution to the world and to this community, and express my condolences to all.
Eventhough this Post will probably go unread: But thank you u/bossgalaga for creating a safe environment for simple questions many haven’t the courage to ask!

I really hope you can Rest In Peace now! Pretty sad 10th anniversary for this sub.
Wonders of mystery

explained in simple terms

It has now become a phrase

u/bossgalaga is now gone

And we are all in a daze.

Victims of Immune deficiency are haunted

So please hear their cry

That's what U/bossgalaga would have wanted

Just something to remember him by.
Personally, I don't know the guy but an online diplomacy player told me to join reddit using this sub as an example. Kudos!
This is awful, I'm so sorry to hear about this! This sub was one of the main reason I got on Reddit to begin with! Really sorry to hear this, u/bossgalaga made learning on the internet fun for everyone! Thank you and RIP!
This is one if my favourite sub-reddits so my thanks and thoughts are with the family
Rest in peace, as long as r/explainlikeimfive exists to make the difficult concepts simple his legacy will live on :)
ELI5: The afterlife.  Rest in Peace, one of the best subs on Reddit.
The whole reason I started on reddit was this sub, meaning that not only do I owe them a debt of gratitude for the amazing and humanizing place to learn from each other, but for my whole reddit experience! Rip, and my thoughts are with their family.
The amount I've learned and shared with people from this sub is remarkable. Thank you for creating a space the internet can be proud of, rest easy.
RIP u/bossgalaga my brain would have less wrinkles if it wasn't for you
Dear u/bossgalaga,
I never knew you, and you never knew me. I only joined Reddit last year, but within that time, ELI5 has helped me understand topics I never thought I could. With that being said, thank you.

Sincerely,
u/JRatMain16
I might not be part of the subreddit, but I enjoy scrolling through it sometimes and learning something new. They created a wonderful subreddit for all to learn, and I will forever thank them, and my thoughts and prayers go to the family and friends
I’ve learned so much from this sub. 
RIP u/bossgalaga.
Rest in Peace bro. I was briefly a mod of ELI5 years and years ago because I got so involved in the sub. I am pretty sure the person involved was BossGalaga. He was a fair and level headed dude and his presence will be sorely missed. My condolences to his friends and family and to the mod team.
RIP. Thank you for all you've done for reddit. Some of these other comments are rather touching...I wonder if the mods might be able to share our collective condolences with the family. 

u/bossgalaga, you created something wonderful. Thank you.
This is honestly my favourite subreddit, I've had so many great experiences with other people and I learned so many interesting things. 

Even though u/bossgalaga is gone, this subreddit will live on and grow even more. I think this is one of the best things that can happen when someone is no more. To create something that goes past themselves. Thanks for creating this subreddit and

Rest In Peace u/bossgalaga.
Never even occurred to me that ELI5 was someone's idea. Like all great ideas it seems like something that just should have always been there. I'm sure there was more to this person than just one good Reddit idea, but for whatever it's worth, thank you u/bossgalaga.
Pretty sure that 10 years of this sub existing means a lot of people who learned more about some cool stuff in a simpler way than 10 years in school. In fact, reading through this very thread I learned something new in a ELI5 format.

Like someone already wrote - this is what internet should be all about.
Through all of the changes that have taken place on Reddit over the many years as our has grown - some good and many not so good - ELI5 has always been a shining example of how good Reddit can be. 

RIP to u/bossgalaga. I did not know you or your help moderators, but thanks to all of you for creating and maintaining one of the best places to learn new things on the web.

Thank you!
RIP in peace

I learned so much about things I never knew I wanted to know or was afraid to ask thanks to u/BossGalaga
RIP u/bossgalaga, I may be pretty new to Reddit compared to some of the other people here, but your subreddit saved me more times than I can count. Thanks for everything
Dang. RIP to a reddit OG. This sub has helped me learn or understand several things better
ELI5 make some really interesting reading. This is a community loss, not just for this subreddit but Reddit as a whole. May they find peace.
Rest in peace
RIP to the baddest bastard to walk this green Earth. You were a real one /u/bossgalaga
RIP dude. You truly did something cool and good for the world.
RIP
This has become one of my favorite subs to browse and is a shining example of how good Reddit can be.
Rest in Peace "bosmang".
Seems like u/bossgalaga has managed to acquire a small measure of immortality. RIP
Every Wikipedia page needs an Eli5 section!

Rest in peace u/bossgalaga, your contribution to many redditors lives is immeasurable.  You have helped me grasp complex ideas in the simplest possible terms. Explanations abound in forms longer than the automod will remove!
It's always a shame to hear of someone's passing, whether it's a celebrity or a common person. I appreciate that he created a sub where everyone can learn something without being shot down for not knowing how something works.
RIP dude, this sub is one of the very best.
This sub has helped me learn so much that I otherwise would of never understood or thought to have learned about, and it has increased my interest in learning so much more. Wouldn't of been possible without /u/bossgalaga may you Rest In Peace.
One of the most underrated subreddits, with one of the hardest working mod teams. He wont be forgotten may he rest in peace
R.I.P.
RIP dude. I've learned so much from this sub, and I've tried to pass that knowledge on to my family too. Truly one of the best parts of Reddit.
Rip
Wow, hope he passed peacefully. He created a subreddit that educated thousands.
RIP
RIP. I do not know him personally but the creation of this subreddit is definitely one of the best thing on the web. It brings experts together to explain things easily to everyone. 

May he be in peace and know that many of us will continue his legacy of finding simple ways to explain topics to everyone.
Rest in peace. My heart goes out to his loved ones. ❤️
damn... rip to the main man
Damn. I've learned so much from this sub thanks him (and other's that answer of course). I'll never be able to express my gratitude for what he has created here.
This sub is like a Wikipedia that responds to questions instead of word inquiries. I and many many others have learned so much from this. Thank you and rest in peace good sir.
R.I.P. u/bossgalaga! You helped twenty million people learn, and thus be better people in a better place. Love and education is a spark of light in an otherwise cold and dark world, and your actions will continue to illuminate!
RIP u/bossgalaga your subreddit has made me smile so many times
I never even thought of finding out who created this sub. It‘s such an integral part of reddit for me that I guess I assumed it was admin-made.

Rest in peace.
RIP
RIP.
ELI5 has been easily my favorite sub since I started using Reddit. I have this community to thank for greater understanding in a whole host of subjects.  

The community u/bossgalaga founded and helped nurture is an incredible resource. The world is certainly diminished by their passing.  

Thank you, u/bossgalaga. Rest in peace.
RIP Thank you u/bossgalaga, and  thank you mods in this sub, for creating and moderating it(which was one of the first I joined after leaving FB). It has helped me understand so much I didnt dare ask myself, and also helped the way to explain stuff to my actual toddlers. Hugs
RIP, the community they founded has helped me personally and tens of millions of people. Such a great contribution to humanity.
This person had one of the best ideas in the world. A place where idiots like me can understand stuff easily. Hope they found peace.
RIP u/bossgalaga. This sub is the Reditt version of  Dad How Do I.
This is hands-down one of my favorite subreddits, and a big reason I’m still here. Very inspiring. Helluva legacy, gotta say that.  See ya soon…
This sub has been my fav sub since I join reddit and I could say it's one of the best. Thank you and rest in peace u/bossgalaga
Rest in peace. You will be missed.
This sub's helped so many people thanks to him, and will definitely help many more for years to come.
Rest in peace u/bossgalaga, this was one of the first subreddits I joined. You made this website a better place
I've always enjoyed this sub. I don't remember when I first joined, but it's been a while. I enjoyed the creative explanations for the topics that come up by necessity, and I'm happy that I found this sub. It's given me a good baseline understanding of a few topics

RIP u/bossgalaga, and thank you
The eli5 concept has been sort of a guiding principle for me when I tutored biologie or when my parents ask about my work/study.

This sub is amazing and u/bossgalaga ‘s legacy will remain! Hope the other mods are alright too, some mod teams are really close <3
RIP. We all are grateful for the awesome sub here. Condolences to his family.
Wherever he is, may he rest in peace knowing that millions of people, including myself have learned so much from this sub. In his honor, I will keep on learning everyday til my last day. Thank you.
RIP, this is definitely the most informative subreddits that I actually browse on often.
rip. this subreddit is super cool and i'm glad it was created, so that even the common person could understand complex topics respectfully. it's inspired me a lot to always look stuff up and learn little facts throughout the day.
This is really sweet of you. Thank you for letting people know. :)
Rest in peace and condolences to his family. This is a fantastic sub.
This sub was what got me started with reddit. Reading questions and answers on here is still fun years later for me. Thank you u/bossgalaga
Awful news. Rest in peace, Boss.
R.I.P
Condolences, especially to his friends and family.
That's sad...he created a fantastic sub, must have been an awesome person
RIP, this was one of the first subs I joined. Weird question, but possibly relevant, does Reddit do anything to handle confirmed user deaths? Facebook will archive accounts of deceased people and their profile page becomes a memorial page. Does Reddit do anything similar?
Rest in peace. Hope you're peaceful and happy now, wherever you may be.
A subreddit that actually made an amazing positive impact on humanity. Thank you
This is a good sub.  RIP bud.
RIP. Thank you for creating a wonderful and amazing sub!
I'm very sorry for the community's loss. This is one of the most sincere and helpful subreddits i have ever had the privilege to be a (very minor) part of.

My condolences.
Pretty crazy how much knowledge has been gained because of him. RIP
Rest In Peace.
RIP to one of the few users on this site who I can recognize. I remember when this sub was founded, and the idea was a stroke of genius. I have a distinct memory of telling my mom when I found it, thinking she'd appreciate it as well.

Bossgalaga did a great thing.
This is very sad to hear. I think about this sub daily for questions from the very simple to the overly complicated. It has also been a great resource to read other people's questions and explanations.


It is great to know that I am not the only one out there that needs things broken down for them... like a five year old...


RIP 😞
Absolute legend, u/bossgalaga shall walk in the halls of Valhalla
RIP. I ask people in the professional world to explain their jargon, processes, etc like I'm five when needed and they get a kick out of it and oblige.

Spreading u/bossgalaga s memory without realizing.
Brilliant sub and I'm sure a brilliant creator. I never knew the guy, but I have a weird sadness knowing he's not with us anymore.
That’s so sad. ELI5 has always been one of my favorite subs, and is a massive part of the reason I signed up for Reddit in the first place.

Rest In Peace, thank you for spreading knowledge to those who hunger for it.
That's so sad! I love this sub, I browse it when bored, and end up learning so much! RIP dude, you started a great thing, and hopefully it'll carry on helping people learn.
:(
Rest in peace. Reddit may be a shithole sometimes, but this sub is consistently one of great quality, and it promotes asking questions without fear of being called an idiot, which is something people should do more often.
To u/bossgalaga you were real good son, maybe even the best. 10 years ago you have us a gift. Though some may not know it, they owe you. Find peace on the other side
Wow. This hits hard. Such a great idea has made living on this planet so much better. Rest in power
RIP. Thank you for creating this sub, I learned so much from it <3
Ugh. I hope he got that french onion soup he was craving. RIP.
Never knew who you were, but I'm grateful for the things I've learned from your sub. Rest well
Thanks for all you did. I hope you are resting well and your family and friends are in good health.
RIP bossgalaga! This sub is truely one of my favorites. I learned and most importantly understood so many things that were never explained to me in the most simple way.
I just joined recently and I must say I’ve loved it. I learn so much more and my understanding of the world has greatly increased. Thank you bossgalaga for  creating a safe space for people to learn and teach.
This is one of my favorite subs! Bossgalaga has left an incredible legacy behind that has helped so many to understand our world a little bit more. I’m so so sorry to hear of his passing.
I don't  know who he was , but he has surely touched my life and in a way I know him now.
ELI5 has been a staple of my redditry since damn near day one. 

So long, and thanks for all the fish, u/bossgalaga 🖤
RIP

Btw, how can I find old top posts from 5-10yrs ago? It seems showing top of all times only shows from last 2 years or so
RIP. Every so often I will come across a question asked here and realise that I’ve often wondered that myself. Then go on to have my curiosity satisfied without the need to do a deep dive into the subject matter. Quite often I leave here more,curious than I arrived. I’m very grateful this sub exists and saddened by it’s founders passing.
It's inspiring to think how something as simple as creating a subreddit has undoubtedly spread so much knowledge. Rest in peace.
One of the best subs of all time. 
RIP u/bossgalaga
ELI5 was one of the primary subs that brought me here. It's actually why my username is what it is. 

RIP u/bossgalaga
The boss is gone but not forgotten.
This was the sub that got me hooked on Reddit. Sad news, rest easy.
RIP, this is a Reddit highlight for me. His legacy will educate and inform into the future.  Thanks for the knowledge.
RIP, your creation will survive forever in your name.
Super wholesome person and they have helped a lot of people feel less stupid. 👏🏻
So sorry to see this news.  It's always sad when someone dies wheter they are a well known actor or just a somebody who made a cool reddit sub.

My heart goes out to the fallen wherever they may be, hopefully in heaven with our father.
Jeez.... Sorry to hear about this. Hoping the best for his friends, family and everyone close to him. I haven't been here long and don't know anyone personally but I'd like to extend sincere gratitude towards BossGalaga and everyone else keeping this sub running.
This is one of my favourite subreddits.  Such a positive contribution, and a wonderful idea. Thank you.
This sub found a way to help educate people without judgment and the typical reddit intellectual snobbery. RIP boss, you left behind a great community 🙏
Condolences 🙏This is one of the first subreddits I found and followed when I started using reddit. I was so grateful to have found a place where I could learn without being treated like I was dumb or stupid.
:(
Death comes for us all in the end, but most aren’t so lucky to truly make an impact and leave this world bettered. I hope for you at least heaven exists for there no doubt where your going. Thank you for all you’ve done you can rest now.
This sub has been so informative to the way I think of explaining middle school math to students. It has created so many cascading benefits. RIP
Wow I am so sorry to hear this. This sub is one of the first ones I found interest in once I learned how Reddit works. 

Condolences to all friends and family, unfortunately death is a reality of life and there’s only so much any one of us can do.
I’m the new mod around here so I don’t know people too well, but this sub is basically the only thing I do on Reddit. It’s been a great experience.
I usually enjoy the posts on this sub. Good thing OP created this sub which has been useful to so many people. RIP u/bossgalaga
"No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away, until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life is only the core of their actual existence."

U/bossgalaga, you'll live forever in all of the learning people have done here, thank you.
What a wonderful sub for the curious. Than you u/bossgalaga for providing the world with this space. Rest in peace.
Thank you for your contribution, /u/bossgalaga. As long as your legacy lives on, you will never truly be gone.
RIP, I enjoyed lurking this sub sad to see him gone.
The first reason why I joined Reddit is because I keep hearing about ELI5 to my colleagues when it comes to explaining. RIP u/bossgalaga
Rest in peace, bro! This sub already taught me tons of things! Your legacy will live on ❤
What a thoughtful way to include others. So many people are too nervous to ask questions for fear of feeling dumb. So sorry they passed, sounded lovely.
RIP u/bossgalaga

You single handedly broadened the knowledge of millions of people and made the world a better, smarter place. Thank you sir, you will be missed. God speed.
It's been an amazing place to learn things I didn't even know I needed to know, and I've been coming here regularly for my TIL moments.   I am sad that the guy who came up with it has passed,  but may he rest in peace knowing he has enlightened so many people out here with his idea.
What sad news. There's a lot of good and a lot of not-so-good on the internet, and r/explainlikeimfive  was one of the very good. Thank you, u/bossgalaga and RIP.
RIP u/bossgalaga. I have donated to the IDF in the past, and it is a great organization that helps with education and research. My son has CVID and we have worked closely with the IDF on many occasions of the years.
My condolences to his loved ones.  This sub has answered some questions I had very well and in an easy to understand way.
I always lurked this subreddit and have learned so much
Easily one of the most regularly informative subreddits. A great contribution to the internet overall, imo. RIP.
/u/bossgalaga, you changed Reddit for the better when you decided to create ELI5. Thank you. Rest easy and in peace now, my friend.
May he rest in peace. I applaud him for sticking to his idea even when he received negative reactions initially in the AskReddit thread. I'd probably backed down and cancelled the idea but he didn't and he ended up making one of the best and most useful subs on here. There's an amazing lesson to be learned from all of this.
It's really sad to hear this this is definitely one of my favourite subs. He leaves a great legacy.
This sub saved me some embarrassing moments. Thank you for this sub and the people who contribute to it. Long live u/bossgalaga and the brilliant idea of creating this!!
RIP u/bossgalaga. I don't know if I ever interacted with you directly, but I interact with this sub a lot and think it is one of the best and most useful on Reddit. Thanks.
Thank you so, so much for starting a community where I have learned directly from the world’s top minds, about subjects never before accessible to the average mind. We will never forget what you have done for this world.
Thank you for making knowledge easy to understand and available to all users!

Puts 💐 on the grave and walks away
RIP... Also does anyone remember that use who wrote like a pirate and was really helpful? He was posting very often then one day he just stopped. Combined with the fact that he mentioned he was quite old makes me only think of the worst...

I have his name on the tip of my tongue right now but can't quite recall it.
My coworkers and I use "ELI5" frequently in the office when we need a quick simple summary of a major issue that is going on.
This sub is one of the ones I think most people sub to when they start on Reddit. He left a legacy, for sure. RIP, u/bossgalaga. If you had the pleasure of knowing him IRL, then feel blessed knowing you knew a person who fostered a lot of people’s curiosity and love of learning.
I love this sub. I'm sad to read of u/bossgalaga passing, but I know that the sub will continue to honor his memory by simply doing what he created it to do: helping everybody to share their knowledge and learn together.

u/bossgalaga may have gone on, but it is now up to us to ensure that his legacy endures far into the future.
There are two really bad things about not knowing something everyone else knows, 1) you are ignorant, and 2) you are embarrassed. Hope u/bogggalaga knew how much better a lot of us felt being less embarrassed. I can, on occassion anyway, come off smart and a lot of that is due to this sub. When you stop feeling stupid and start feeling smart the gains are exponential. I cant thank him enough.
Poor guy, hope he is experience peace now if there is an after life

Last post was, "Seriously, where was the NSFL tag???" which is... Kind of appropriate in a sense

Hope any family and friends of his are holding out ok
ELI5 is an example of how reddit, the internet and the world can work together. This sub is visionary, and we can all learn from this example of giving. RIP
This is probably the hardest a random stranger's death has hit me. May he rest in peace, the world today lost a legend. Also, I'm not entirely sure but it seems like he died of cancer, just like someone who was very close to me. Fuck Cancer, it has taken away so many innocent lives.
One of the first subs I was ever a part of. RIP u/bossGalaga thank you for your contributions
What a great legacy to leave us all. RIP and condolences to his family and friends.
Rest in peace. 💕
Thanks... For me, ELI5 is awesome breaking down the misunderstanding of so much garbage that its really made it useful for explaining things in every day life.

Legendary sub creator.
RIP u/bossgalaga maybe now you are in a place where you can truly learn everything there is to know to ELI5
This sub has easily been one of the most educational and entertaining subreddit I interact with across all my accounts. It’s sometimes the center of the most creative individuals focused on explaining things in different or even strange ways to teach those who have questions. 

Thank you, BossGalaga. I can’t say someone else wouldn’t have eventually had this subreddit idea, but I’m glad it was around already when I started.
R.I.P u/bossgalaga. 

I'm really sorry for always asking questions that end up removed. I'm trying my best. 

Your creation has been useful to many, and we will cherish it even if you're not here to witness it anymore.

We'll miss you dearly. 

Farewell.

-KyrosTheWarrior
Every Wikipedia page needs an Eli5 section!
RIP. thank you for your work u/bossgalaga, I'm now twice as smart
The world need knowledges, this sub is a sanctuary for any person who is looking for it.
I do not know you, but I hope that you were proud of what you and so many people did.

Wish you a pleasant journey to your next destination.
Eli5 - What is passing away?

Rest in peace...
Thank you.
RIP
Rip. This sub was a great idea and is a great place to learn.
This sub has provided so much positivity and information to the world. Thank you u/bossgalaga for making knowledge more accessible to everyone.
Rest in peace
This sub is what I look forward whenever I logged in to Reddit and it is and will always be a great source of general knowledge for me. It is with great sadness that I came to know the passing of the founder of this sub. My heartfelt condolences to the families (IRL) of  /u/bossgalaga as well as his online family here in ELI5. May you rest in peace! You made us smarter than we're five in every way..
He did something that so many of us strive for. He made himself, or at least just partly, immortal. Through this place he will live forever. RIP you magnificent specime of humanity.
RIP: from a guy sorting on r/all, I loved this idea, it was really wholesome!
Rip
[this is the best explanation of how the sub runs!](https://imgur.com/gallery/YLJhniY)
<3

This is one of the few subs on reddit where people can come and learn something without being embarrassed about not having high level knowledge or ability.

I know it sounds weird to say it because this is reddit, but his creation of this sub did a great service to education, knowledge, and humanity.
Awww he contributed to entertaining and educating a lot of people.

Good contribution to society. Rest well dude.
RIP.
Rest in peace u/bossgalaga.
Thanks and Rest in Peace.
is sub is and was a great idea and shows what the internet can enable us to do. To help eachother learn new things everyday. Rest in peace u/bossgalaga and thank you!
Never heard of u/bossgalaga until this very moment, yet I feel the loss with the rest of the sub.

RIP and let learning long be a part of your legacy.
Rest In Paradise my friend.  Excelsior <3
This is rather unfortunate. This sub has been so great for so many reasons, and I do owe him the courage to give us a place to ask freely. RIP.
I'm not a very good explainer, but ELI5 has challenged me to be a better communicator. It serves to show me that many things in life can be communicated simply and effectively.

I was always troubled when I had to communicate with students and executives. The students don't know jack, and the execs have only time for a paragraph.

I don't talk much here, but I use inspiration from this room to talk in my real life. I am a lecturer, and communication is important.
This is a beautifully crafted sub,& I, for one, appreciate it's simplicity in explaining without a condescending way. Thank you u/bossgalaga .
This is my absolute favorite subreddit. I have a lot of dumb questions, and an endless desire to learn, and r/explainlikeimfive has selflessly indulged me every single time. Thank you, u/bossgalaga, for creating this paradise for me and all the other curious five year olds out there. Rest well knowing the legacy you've left behind is invaluable.
Thank you for helping to enrich and enlighten one thread and comment at a time. 

Your legacy lives on in every Redditor who asks someone to ELI5 and/or someone who decides to do the explaining. 

Rest easy.
Thank you u/bossgalaga the world is a harsh place but you made a place for those to get the help they needed without being ridiculed
RIP. I recently discovered this sub, but I feel like it's made me smarter.
Rest in peace brother 🙏
Thanks u/bossgalaga for changing my experience on the internet for the better. I can't picture reddit without this.

My one popular post was in this sub. Without that post I'd never remember how old my dog is. And for that, my 6-year-old dog also thanks you.
RIP. This sub is a wonderful place for learning things.
This sub is honestly one of the most educational subs on reddit, and was one of the main reasons i made an actual account. Its taught me so much and i really appreciate that the creator was able to make something of it. Hope he's resting peacefully.
Jesus the replies in his thread announcing it were so cynical. Few people anticipated how creative the format would nudge people to be.

And it may be too soon, but how's this for a person's last ever comment?

> Seriously, where was the NSFL tag???
He has created quite the legacy on Reddit
2 things I love the most from this sub: wholesome learning and absence of condescension. Thank you, u/bossgalaga. This is exactly the kind of atmosphere I wish to be spread around the internet.
On Shanti. I learnt a lot from this sub. Respect to the dude
rest well u/bossgalaga
RIP u/bossgalaga this sub has taught me so much and I'm so grateful it was created. Lots of love and well wishes from this internet stranger to their family
Didn't know him, but love the sub and noticed he was often in the SD and Padres subs. RIP and FTD man
Sad news, can you guys ELI5 the circumstances of his passing?
Thanks for creating one of the few chill and useful corners of the internet.  RIP
May you find peace and tranquility in the void, good sir. You may not be among us any more, but your legacy shall endure so long as this subreddit lasts. If you had any family, I hope they are able to remember your life and smile at all the good times you had together.
This was one of the few subreddits I kept from all the ones that were included in the autofill front page when I made my account. I've learned tons from this subreddit over the years, and will continue to do so. RIP u/bossgalaga your legacy lives on.
Sorry if this inappropriate to say, I find it haunting that his last post was merely a few weeks ago.
May he rest in peace.
Edit: grammar
ah thats sad.

may he rest in peace
I'm familiar with IDF since I have an immune deficiency myself. It's a bitch. If he suffered as well it certainly could have been a factor. Wishing his loved ones comfort
RIP. You will be missed, regardless of if we know your real identity or not.
I don’t have personal anecdotes about u/bossgalaga myself, but since I found the sub have enjoyed it above most other reddit content. It’s often really interesting information as well as being modded really well. 
  
RIP and thanks for the contribution to making the internet a less dumb place.
I didn't know him but I hope he rests in peace
RIP to a legend with a good idea that benefitted countless people.
Rest in peace, /u/bossgalaga
rip
Hello am new I hope am welcomed
R.I.P I joined Reddit because of the existence of subreddits like this. Thank you!
One of my favorite subs. So sad.
RIP Boss
RIP the Boss, and my condolences to his family
RIP, one of the greatest subreddits ever.
Rip bossgalaga this sub has shone light on many a darkness. Long may your dream live on 😇🙏
Your sub has taught me more than I’d like to admit, bossgalaga. You will be missed, while your influence lives on.
RIP u/bossgalaga
Rip u/bossgalaga this sub taught me so much and was and still is a fun sub to browse 
Thank you
What a hero. He created a civil and helpful sub that promotes education and better understanding. This is exactly what the internet should be about.
My heartfelt condolences. I do not know him personally but I am grateful that he came up with this idea of creating a sub that answers seemingly simple questions. We all could use a bit of explaining no matter what our age is.
rip /u/bossgalaga thankful for the legend that put this sub together and saved us all from asking some potentially embarrassing questions
Rip king
Rip. o7
Rip
A legend in Reddit world. RIP Boss
Rip u/bossgalaga 😔 🙏🏼
RIP to a legend.
Rest in peace, this is one of my favorite subs on the site and I thank him for making it.

Is it known what happened to him, or is that being kept private? Sorry if I sound insensitive
Rip u/bossgalaga. May you be in a far better location than this world.
Thanks u/bossgalaga. Rest in bliss knowing you've helped countless people to learn things they might not have without this platform.
rip, this subreddit is a godsend for learning things
My sincerest condolences to his family. This is one of the nicer parts of Reddit. I love to learn stuff and this subreddit is a great place to do that.
It is funny how much I have learned from this thread. I will be forever thankful for a subreddit that allows questions that other might think is dumb. Without asking the question free of judgement, we often are too scared to learn what we need to know. 

Thank you one last time U/bossgalaga
This was one of the first subs that for me interested in Reddit. It was super useful and unique in its tone. I love reading that u/bossgalaga pushed for non judgemental responses. Almost seems like an unbelievably huge request now but it worked! Thanks boss for a wonderful sub and all your hard work. RIP good man/woman.
Wow. R.i.p, you created something extraordinary!
Rest well and thank you for creating such an iconic, cool, and wholesome space.
Genuinely one of the best subs
They say you're not really gone until there's no one left who remembers your name, and certainly we'll remember the person who created a place as useful and sorely needed as this for a long time to come.  I don't usually post here, but I've lurked for quite a number of years enjoying the huge breadth of knowledge that ELI5 has to offer.  It's been a huge help to me and, I know, to lots of other people around the world.

Thank you and rest in peace, /u/bossgalaga.
Such an absolutely awesome and altruistic idea that idea was, and look where this sub is now. So wholesome. Imagine if everyone could try and help as much as he did, the world would truly be a better place.
RIP.  Sorry to hear the news.  I'm relatively new to reddit, but I get a lot of value from this sub.
I came to Reddit because of the diversity of communities. Now I'm part of over 100 of them, and check out others occasionally. This is one of the subs I spend the most time in. It's always interesting, and I almost always always learn something. 

Thanks, u/bossgalaga. Rest well.
This subreddit has done so much good for me and my students. Forever indebted. May you find peace and eli5 how heaven looks like u/bossgalaga
This sub has been a lifeline for my stupidity. Rest in peace, utterly heartbreaking
R.I.P. Boss.
RIP u/bossgalaga such sad news. Didn’t know him personally but just wanted to pay my respects here and say that ELIF is my daily bedtime sub read and has been for a long time as a user. Always something interesting here and for me his legacy will live on. 

Knowledge is at its most powerful when it is passed on freely and without want in return.
RIP, what a legend.
Man, RIP. 

ELI5 is awesome, hands down. I’ve answered a few questions, asked a few questions, but mostly I see someone else’s submission and think “That’s a friggin awesome question, now I kind of need to know the answer.”

As much as a trawl Reddit for laughs, I absolutely love the things one can learn on this site.
I don't post here a lot but I do lurk because the questions and answers are truly fascinating at times. It's extremely humbling to see how one man made a giant impact on the world, I hope he realised this before his passing.
only sub that was never toxic
This is one of the greatest subs on Reddit for me. Everyday I learn something new, or expand my knowledge about something I already knew. Thanks you all for this amazing community.  

RIP u/bossgalaga, and thanks for starting this.
As most know, trying to interact with reddit for the first time can be nerve wracking. ELI5 was and still is the one place I go to often and feel like it's okay to ask dumb questions. I always come here first, get my bearings and say to myself, hey, I too needed this explained to me like a 5yr old.

This sub made me feel normal. Im so sad to hear the one who created this awesome sub is gone. He helped connect so many people via this sub...and help the rest of us feel a little less dumb. My heart goes out to the family and friends ❤️ Godspeed.
May they rest in peace. Thanks for having a crrative idea and actually realizing it. Thanks for creating this subreddit. You will forever be a part of its legacy!
RIP 
This was one of the first group suggested to me when I wanted to get involved in Reddit 
And since then ,one of the most knowledgeable.

In a world with compete stupidity, groups like this deserve all the praise.

We shall keep your memory alive
This has helped me understand many concepts as a dumbass, he was doing amazing work and I hope we continue his legacy and that he rests wrll
This sub is one of my favorites and has led me to learning some things I never would have otherwise.

RIP u/bossgalaga
This person not only created a very popular subreddit, but something that is widely known and is understood outside of this little place we call Reddit. Reddit has many foundations in memes and there is a popular notion of it being a picture with words, but there is also the definition that it is a unit of cultural information.

ELI5 is exactly that. A unit of cultural information that has made waves on Reddit, but also ripples across the world. What a testament to u/bossgalaga for creating something that is so special and prolific *and positive*.
Damn. Deep condolences to him/her and their family.  I hope they know what a great thing he/she created and how many folks he enlightened.
May he Rest in Peace.
Rest in peace, man. Reddit wouldn't be the place we know and love without you, and the site is poorer for your passing.

Now start taking notes, because when I die, I'm gonn have some questions.
That’s very sad but at least his idea will live on for a long time. Love this subreddit
> I'm calling it r/explainlikeimfive.

Goddamn... Little did he know that 10 years later, his creation would be one of the pinnacle subs in all of Reddit.

Sad news indeed. This is one of my favourite subs. RIP.
Awful news, this is always one of the first subreddits I visit and I've learnt so much from it over the years. Thank you for creating it. Condolences to your family, RIP boss!
He created a rare safe space on reddit. My deepest condolences to his friends and family.
Eli5 is like Wikipedia for me, but information on random topics, I love it. Sad to hear of the passing. RIP
I remember that post, starting this subreddi.t
I'm new here and within the past few months learns of ELI5. I've spent my whole life thus far on a quest to gain knowledge. This sub has been a big help and a huge inspiration. RIP, and thank you for making this place
Dang. I've never posted here but I remember when this sub appeared and how it caused a flurry of excitement among various friends who were just learning any and everything here. I've come here for research, for just plain old learning, and sometimes because seeing people kindly and patiently explain things reminds me of some people who educated me irl. It must be a painful loss for their family and friends, and I'm so sorry. It's beautiful that the legacy u/bossgalaga is leaving behind is one of kindness, patience, and education.
Rest in peace, mate. Thanks so much for creating the subreddit.
thank you u/bossgalaga for creating this subreddit and rest in peace <3 we all learn something new everyday because of you
I have learned a lot from this sub and I'm really grateful for its creation. Hope u/bossgalagas' memory is well served by its continuation.
Rip💐
Still one if my favorite subs to learn fun snippets on. He really created something simple yet wonderful. RIP
How great it is, to be an individual with an idea on the internet and create a place that has helped so many. Rest in peace.
Now i feel sad :(
It's been one hell of a decade from inception, I don't think I ever interacted with him myself but may he rest in peace. He fostered one hell of a shining star subreddit for it to last this long as a default and still maintain quality.
I really appreciate this sub. I’m recovering from a brain injury. ELI5 is super helpful to me, it’s one of my favorite subs.
Rest In Peace, u/bossgalaga - such a simple idea of a sub that has had a genuine impact on not only my life but several others as well. The ability to ask the bigger questions without possessing the knowledge to understand it outright is extremely valuable. Thank you for your contribution
This was my first go-to subreddit and one I really read extensively and have even had questions answered myself. Sorry to see that a great community founder has passed. RIP
This is one of the few places that earnestly bends over backwards for novices to make something more accessible and less pedantic. Rest In Peace, and thank you.
Damn.

may u/bossgalaga rest in peace, and may he not be forgotten
Rest In Peace, u/bossgalaga, and thank you for your contributions.  ❤️
Sadness.  This is the only place where you can ask easily goggleable questions without being laughed  at.  Learned a bunch of random facts here.
RIP to the founder of such an informative and interesting sub, I have learned many things on here and hope to continue doing so. 

u/bossgalaga you are gone but not forgotten, sleep easy and rest assured we will continue learning in your legacy🙏🏼
RIP Legend. Thank you for making one of my favourite subs to visit for glorious knowledge!
That's sad to hear. Hopefully they've gone to something better.
I've learned so much cool stuff from this sub. His legacy shines on not only on Reddit but in the minds of many, many people.
This sub has been a complete and wonderful joy to me. So many questions I always wanted to ask but was too scared.
RIP been an ELI5 fan for a long time. I love how this format has leaked into other responses on subs as well.
Awe man, that original thread was one of the first things I remember from when I created my account here. I think this might be the first non-default sub I joined. RIP.
RIP u/bossgalaga for teaching me how lifelong learning is for all of us if we just work together and be nice. What an amazing legacy, thanks from Australia and hugs to his family xox
I feel for the friends and family of u/bossgalaga, and for the moderators who worked with him. It's hard to know that good mods, good people are taken from us before we could ever fathom.

I never knew this man, but I recognise his impact on this site, and in the wider world. Truly a man who changed something in the world for the better. May his legacy live on, and those who mourn him most take comfort in the knowledge that he really was special, even if he wasn't known by those who are newer to the site. Rest in Peace u/bossgalaga.
RIP. K.I.S.S is best and fits this group perfectly.
Rip, u/bossgalaga
<3
I’m thankful to the creator as well as the MOD team and all the members that keep this place alive and well!

Thank you u/bossgalaga and may you Rest In Peace!
RIP. I didn't know him, but I love the subreddit that he created. His legacy will live on through /r/ExplainLikeImFive.
Even though he’s passed he’ll be around forever with this subreddit. A true safe space where there are no dumb questions. Thanks u/bossgalaga
rip :(
I'm honouring in the only way I know, through memes:

https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ou976b/its\_a\_sad\_day\_for\_knowledge/
Gotta give respect to u/bossgalaga

He founded one of the best subreddits I've ever come across, great concept and glad to see it still working great today.
R.I.P. love this place
This is the sub that got me to join Reddit. RIP u/bossgalaga and thank you for bringing this community into my life.
May you find peace.
Wow — I totally liked this initial post for the sub idea and wow I’ve been on Reddit for way too long!
I heard about this thru a meme, and i wanted to give my sincerest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased, i hope they are all holding up ok in this sad time
My sincere condolences to his friends and family.
Rest in piece man, I struggle with an immune deficiency too, and have way too many friends and family that have passed away from complications due to PI. Thank you for spreading the knowledge of the IDF, and of course, creating a community that has helped me learn things in a much simpler, and easier way.
RIP! Thanks to everyone involved in the sub and more.
Fuck this hits deep
ELI5 was my gateway drug to the rest of reddit.

Rest easy u/Bossgalaga, and thanks.
You should some how make this post available for all time.
RIP, u/bossgalaga, I'm smarter than most 5 year olds due to you.
RIP. Learnt a lot using this sub. A work well and and will be always remembered for. The legacy will live on.
Much the same as everyone else, this sub has helped me understand so many subjects that just went right over my head. This is the only subreddit where I don't down-vote posts, as every one is interesting and everyone is nice. That's a feat in and of itself. In making 'be nice' the number one rule, you also remind me with each post that not everyone on Reddit is a jerk. 

I believe education is the key to solving the world's problems, and it is always sad to lose a force of good in the world, but man if you didn't have an excellent impact! I can only hope to bring knowledge to as many people as you - but I will try.

Thank you, and may you rest in peace u/bossgalaga.
I’ve never asked a question in this sub but often see posts of questions that are relevant to things I often have wondered about. The answers from the community are on point and usually better than anything I could ask for otherwise by asking people I know or through search engines, etc. I rarely ask things IRL for fear of coming off as stupid for not knowing common knowledge or for the fear of not understanding “easy” explanations. I am a chick, have ADHD (that auditory processing time can be a bitch along with shit focus), and I have tried to shed the “ditzy Barbie” stereotype that often clings to folks like myself. This sub and others like it are a godsend to me and my self-esteem. 

RIP u/bossgalaga. Your legacy will live on. My thoughts are with your family and friends.
ELI5 has become part of the vernacular. Folks say it at work all the time. Kind of a cool legacy. Rest In Peace.
It’s a fun sub. Interesting and informative. So I’m sure he brought more important things to the world, but he also brought this one, and he helped a bunch of us learn things, which is pretty cool.
I know I've definitely been able to better understand many things thanks to this subreddit, and sincerely appreciate those who've had just the right ways of explaining or illustrating many concepts I struggled to grasp previously. This is a great example of a community-driven learning environment, and I'm glad u/bossgalaga had the initiative to create it and the drive to help maintain it.
Thank you for creating a wonderful and fun sub!
Rest In Peace, sir. My condolences to his friends, family and children
ELI5 is the TIL we never knew we needed. Thanks buddy.
RIP. Good sub.
My highest upvoted comment was an Eli5 post that explains how the internet works.  Posts like this have educated redditors for the past decade. 

Thanks boss Galaga for making the world a better place. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/539y59/z/d7rcm7k
Thank you for the creation and movement for this sub. I've had laughs from some of the ELI5 answers that have also been the best explanations, and others are truely unique.

Rest well, and best wishes to your loved ones and family.
Ah that's so sad :(

Good job for this post, we didn't personally know then but I'm sure we are all thankful for the creation of this subreddit x
This is one of my favorite subs. Thank you u/bossgalaga for creating this space of the internet. We will continue to make posts and comments in your honor here.
I can’t believe how much I’ve learned as a direct result of this one person’s actions. 

RIP internet stranger and thank you for your contribution.
Didn't know the user but thank you for making Reddit a better place. Peace be with you.
I feel great gratitude for him making a place where you can learn. No matter the barrier. Even though I don't often this sub, even just browsing always gave a new idea. It was like a thorough fun fact every day I read here. The man made a good idea. I'm thankful for the man and may he R.I.P. As a side note, do we know at what age he dies? We somehow know that he died and that seems to be the only information? Just curious.
I learned a lot because of you, thank you. I hope you find peace and know that you left the world better than you found it.


Thank you.
Rest In Peace. This was the subreddit that brought me to Reddit. Condolences to his family.
The Padres and Chargers lost a great fan.. right in the middle of a amazing season. May he watch over the fields and this subreddit wherever he is.
I recently rediscovered this sub. Every day it seems like I find a question that I've never asked, with a helpful answer that makes me feel a little bit more informed
ELI5 has inspired me and reminded me to take time to explain the obvious to the high school kids I mentor. Today I showed 20 kids how to use a drill to screw together 2 pieces of wood. Super simple, but it really made an impact to kids that had never held a drill and had no idea how important a pilot hole is. We all begin life ignorant, and learn in many different ways. It’s so easy to forget that others don’t share our experiences and knowledge and may not know things obvious to us.
Great sub, sir. RIP.
I didn’t even know he was, but his impact on my life is now known. Rest In Peace.
Rest in peace. Thank you for this sub. It's continued to produce quality, and easily digestable posts from experts to layfolk.

I hope this community stays the course. Again, thank you and may you rest well.
Gone but never forgotten, RIP u/bossgalaga. 

I lurk this sub pretty much all the time, id be lying if I said I didn't learn a few things. One of the first subs I've followed and enjoyed my time.

Wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. Thank you.
RIP. Your contributions got me through some tough spots in college, and even up to today. Thank you very much!
Taught me to say “explain to me like I’m five” as opposed to the forever self deprecating downer of “explain to me like I’m stupid” …. Thanks Bossgalaga.
I love this sub because I think it encourages the most basic instinct: curiosity. We came out of the cave and looked around and were filled with wonder. In this day and age, we are unexpectedly burdened with too much knowledge. So much so that if we ask questions, people tell you to look it up. That doesn’t mean you necessarily learn anything. We simply learn the answer, but not the why or how. That is the beauty of this sub. We learn the why. The how. We learn the basics that explain the complex. So, thank you.
Rip. I actually Recognize his username from the taco bell sub reddits I had no idea he created this sub. May he always be remembered through ELI5
Condolences to all who knew and loved bossgalaga. He gave us as a gift and we are grateful to him. May we perpetuate his memory and keep it alive.
RIP u/bossgalaga I think we all gained at least a little bit of knowledge from what you've made. You've truly created something beautiful and should be proud of it.
it's pretty cool that some random dude started a community on the internet a decade ago. as a result, millions of people from all around the world learnt about all kinds of stuff. and now people from all around the world are acknowledging his passing despite having never met him. thank you, internet. thank you, /u/bossgalaga
RIP. While I don't think that I ever interacted with him directly, but what he created has helped me understand and learn a good chunk of the more complicated topics that I know!

A personal friend of u/bossgalaga (Brandon) has set up a go fund me for his funeral expenses.

Edit: a word
This is overwhelming. It was one of the first followings when I started on reedit (from a different account). He must have been a wonderful soul to create something like this. May he rest in peace.
It’s interesting to see all the top comments on the post that started this sub all doubting the idea. Rest easy, u/bossgalaga.
RIP
