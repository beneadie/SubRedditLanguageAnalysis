Join the Battle for Net Neutrality! Net neutrality will die in a month and will affect Dota 2 and many other websites and services, unless we fight for it!

honestly what the fuck is happening in the USA...
This will hopefully be obvious to most people, but I feel obligated to add my 2 cents as a PhD economist who is somewhat known in this community.  The impact of a net neutrality repeal on online gaming, livestreaming, and esports would be dramatic and potentially irrevocable.  We cannot afford to take a wait and see attitude or to assume that this would be reversed under a different future political regime.  I know a lot of gamers do not want to hear about politics but PLEASE make your voice heard on this.
Talking on the phone is easily one of my least favorite things. It gives me inexplicable anxiety, and I'm not an anxious person. Just got off the phone with my congresswoman and would urge you to consider calling too friends. 
I'm more concerned about the porn.
USA land of the free LUL
1. US threatens to rollback net neutrality
2. Internet goes full pitchfork mode
3. US backs off
4. Repeat every year
geez, I feel like we have to do this every 3 months.

As of writing, there have only been 18k calls recorded on BattleForTheNet.com today, despite the significantly larger number of upvotes the various posts on Reddit have received. Now is your time to act, people: no one can make that call but you, and every single call counts!

edit: to those of you who don't want to call or have already called, have a look at https://resistbot.io/ , where you can send a fax/email/letter.

edit 2: for those of you not in the US, there would unfortunately seem to be very little that you can do in terms of direct protest (we have to flood our congressional representatives so that they understand that if they do not use the Congressional Review Act (1996) to shoot down the FCC's vote, that they will not have a job after the 2018 elections). That being said **THERE IS STILL SOMETHING YOU CAN DO!** Educate people, especially anyone you know in the United States that hasn't called/faxed/emailed yet, because this affects everyone.  **Educate, spread the word, make yourself heard. A staggering number of people in America don't even know that this is happening.**

This will happen every few months until they succeed or the US gets rid of ~~legalized bribery~~ lobbying

Is there anything a non-american citizen like myself can do besides sit back and hope for the best?
I sent messages to my representatives, which happen to be deep in Republican territory. They responded by thanking me for my message and that they know best and they support repealing Net Neutrality. They don't care and I do not have the money to make them care.
As somebody outside of the US: Can I even do anything?
Those fuckers have no idea what kind of storm is coming. Dear redditors, this is our final stand and we must prevail!
America is so fucked up right now.. damn.
I can't understand how people here can say that we would be fine in the EU. Almost all the big services come from the US. If one service can't penetrate the market because a more familiar one gets favored in the US, then we won't see this service in the EU or anywhere else. It's that simple. If you can't make it in the US, chances are high that you won't make it anywhere else.
NA worse than 3rd world countries LUL
I'm usually for complete freedom of speech, but this fucker in the lead of the FCC needs someone to tell him his opinion is wrong.
Not US citizen thank god
Wasn't this game specifically targeted by ISPs for throttling a few years back and the ISPs got sued? Something about throttling during a major tournament... Or maybe I'm thinking of another game, since I don't play this.
yes this is huge, if you think this doesn't affect you then you are either not a US citizen ( :) ) or you are ill-informed

but seriously, even for us non US ppl it's important, a lot of the internet infrastructure could be affected and we really don't want that
Second that! If you are in America call your representatives! Only the House can stop it now. 
I've been feeling like the battle for Net Neutrality is like the battle against depression. Suddenly it's a big deal, has the potential to ruin your life so you start fighting AND YOU FIGHT HARD. But it's depression. You make some progress, small, maybe your life gets better. For a few weeks you think you start having a better outlook. It stops being a "now" problem. You forget about it because you are so engaged in your day to day life, or at least try to be, that you don't think about it. You don't let it affect you. You think it goes away. Only, after a few months, suddenly you have a bad day and it comes back. In all it's crushing and debilitating glory. You have to fight again.
Australian checking in here, please keep fighting! 

&nbsp;

Ladies and Gents you might not yet know the ramifications of Net Neutrality or care about it but please keep fighting, I urge you to. Let me tell you what it's like to live **without** Net Neutrality and why you should care! In Australia, it's already an issue as we don't have it and if this gets repealed in the US I'm damn sure it'll get 100 times worse here.

&nbsp;

Currently it mainly affects music streaming, movie services and online television, as well as internet speeds (upload & download) and data caps which have been a thing here forever sadly. If you don't want to pay $5.99 a month extra for spotify because your ISP doesn't have a deal with them, or pay extortionate amounts for online movie and tv services because a rival ISP has exclusive rights, then please speak up and let your voice be heard.

&nbsp;

Can't afford to pay $80+ AUD a month for a good plan? Well then here, have our discount $50 a month plan but get terrible speeds that make dial up seem fast. Granted ADSL2 isn't much faster but there's already plans that have different prices that stipulate different speeds of your download/upload connection. No new technology, no fancy cables or anything, just the ISPs charging you more to fully access the network that's in the ground. Oh and when you go over your data cap, you basically can't access the internet unless you buy more data or upgrade your plan to a more expensive one, depending what's in your contract. Think it's easy to change contracts? Nope, think again. All ISPs work on 2 year lock in contracts with high exit penalties, often resulting in you paying out either some extortionate amount of money ($500+ AUD) or the rest of the contract and other bullshit exit fees.

&nbsp;

Keep fighting the good fight because this is just the tip of the iceberg and will only get worse for all of us if this gets passed.
This needs way more attention.
How does this impact online gaming for the average dude?
Elections have consequences. But hey at least we will get huge tax breaks on the next private jet we buy.
We didn't have net neutrality until 2015. How were online games affected by not having it before then?
Canadian users: Contact the Minister of Foreign Affairs to explain your displeasure and why pressure needs to be applied to kill this bill. Urge her to take action and bring that pressure to bear on her US counterparts!

For better or worse, the world currently runs on American internet in the US and so the rules for it don't hold ISP's as accountable.
Since when can /r/dota2 make posts with 40K votes wtf
Sorry for me being stupid(im russian and isnt familiar with na government or formal english), if i got everything right, some US boys want strict internet rules to see everything what im doing and control my movements, why do i need to make a call from a different part of the earth, isnt there a petition for this?
Everything in america that can be used to creating extra income will be used. Schools, hospitals, prisons, medicine, universities. Making money from inequality and over the backs of poor people is the backbone of america. Net neutrality is important, but it will certainly be dismissed at some point if america doesn't change it's core values. 
Is there anything we, non americans, can do?
Sopa Cabana, I remember still. Why americans must put this drama out every year?
Does this affect anyone outside the US? Anything we can do anyway because fuck that shit? 
I'm from russia, how to call your Congress to drop some cyka blyats?
this kills the dota.
I just wanna get back to the days when not everyone was a retard on internet, so I'm kinda down on this matter. 
Honestly I'm out of fucks to give for the US. If they want to repeal net neutrality, then let them do it and watch their economy burn down. Big companies like Valve and Amazon will simple move to Europe asap and the US will end up as a third world country if they keep this shit going. Your not the center of the World, so stop pretending to be it. You want net neutrality? Then move out of the fucking country until the fire is out.
Seriously, they're trying with this shit again..?
Didn't we fight it off again and again and again. How the fuck does this shit keep coming back. Stay Dead you piece of shit bill. 

I suddenly don’t want to live on this planet anymore...
Can someone give me a tl dr on consequences of no more net neutrality?
White wash the news..
as a not NA guy should i care ? I read some of this stuff and tbh it doesn't seem to affect europe at all
it doesn't matter lol

our representatives will do whatever they want regarding this.
NA net neutrality LUL
Pretty sure this only affects people in the U.S
Who cares about NA?
[deleted]
net neutrality is a nice little battlefield the internets has set up, but its mostly pointless.  the big ISPs are big and rich enough to get the deals they want anyway, and internet service (especially in the US where NN laws are at the forefront) is still shitty and expensive and underperform the rated speeds because they have a monopoly cuz what are you gonna do? not have internet, or go to that other guy that does the same shit.  so while they cant throttle except for premium sites, they can give everyone an equally shitty performance and fill your browsing with targeted ads

How will it affect dota2?
Funny how site-wide spamming is okay all of a sudden.  

free internet no bitching
Net neutrality is not a good thing, because it prevents people from doing legitimate things on the internet. Most people think net neutrality is simply a way of making sure that the internet is not censored. Rather, internet neutrality is a way of allowing internet providers to filter content that they think is illegal, or slow down content that they think is taking up too much space.

The FCC had previously attempted to enforce such rules illegally, but lost in the Comcast v FCC case. This time Verizon took them on, and FCC lost again! You see, back in the Clinton years, a bill passed with bipartisan support that freed the Internet from burdensome regulation. It was called the Telecommunications Act, and its specifically separated information services from telecommunications services, disallowing the FCC from imposing the same degree of regulations on Internet services that they can on the Phone company. This was important in the debate before the Open Internet order, because Net Neutrality had already been ruled illegal in the Comcast case. So the radical left had argued that the FCC should wave a magic wand and declare that Internet service providers are no longer information services, and are now phone companies, and so should be reclassified as such. Today’s decision in Verizon v FCC rests on the classification of ISPs as being information services, as envisioned by the Telecommunications Act, which again was passed by Newt Gingrich’s House and signed by Bill Clinton. That’s how much of a common-sense thing it used to be, to have a lightly-regulated Internet. Bottom line do you really want the Govt to control your use of the Information Super Highway? Net Neutrality does nothing but give immense power to the FCC.
I wished there was ways people outside of the US can support.  
Our countries would look at the US and might get funny ideas trying to emulate it not to mention that they might impose a tariff on websites outside of the US as well.

What can someone who is not a resident of the USA do?
How does affect other countries? How can I have an impact from other country?
I'm not an American, but I'll do my best to spread the awareness about this. Fuck all the greedy companies. 
can a non us resident vote for this?
So, this is NA only so far?
is this only in the US or ?
This only affects the US right? So as a European I will not be affected (Even tho I am supporting your fight!)?

Does that even matter for people outside EUA?
[deleted]
can I only vote when im US ?
This is even worse than LoL
[deleted]
anybody got a link to the actual text of the proposal?
Does anyone know if there are any Flyers that I can print off to put up in public places?
Someone brave enough should be pushibg for shit that makes it impossible for these legislations to happens. This is like the 5th time for this shit.
So, what can a non-US citizen or even a US citizen living abroad actually DO, outside of donating to ACLU and just plain hoping that your congressmen get their shit together?
US best country on the planet kappa5million 
Text "resist" to 504-09 to contact your representative. It's free.
Text resist to 504-09 and let resistbot guide you through sending faxes, calling, emailing, and snail mailing your words to your representatives. It’s free and is so freaking easy. Seriously, try it. Give your reps a fucking earful!
What can I do, being from Germany?
Is this for those from US only or does it applied to other countries too?
This may be a stupid question, but can't a new ISP come into business providing net neutrality, and then people can go with this ISP.
I totally support net neutrality. Just trying to understand how Comcast  and at&t have us at their mercy.

Those coming from /r/all

Dota 2 is a free to play game created by Valve Software based on the Warcraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients (DotA) which was released around 2003/2004. DotA is also a game that many other popular MOBAs took inspiration from (League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite). The game is a 5 vs 5 game in which each player chooses to play 1 of 112 unique Heroes, each having their own unique abilities and techniques. Dota 2 has a very strong Esports following, having numerous international tournaments throughout the year, the most recent one being Valve's Boston Major, which concluded a few hours ago.

Dota has had many patches over the years, starting from 0.95 to 3.XX, 4.XX and so on. The first 6.XX installment was released in 2005, more than a decade ago. All patches since then have followed the 6.XX numbering.

The last major gameplay update, 6.88, was April 25th this year.

Everyone has been eagerly awaiting this patch, as it also marks the addition of the first hero not present in the original Dota mod, Monkey King. We all expected the patch to be called 6.89 and shake up the game but **IT'S GOING TO BE FUCKING _7.00_. SO MUCH IS GOING TO CHANGE HOLY SHIT**

##**_GET HYPED_**

**If you are interested in learning how to play Dota 2, [go to this page on getting started!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_some_basic_tips_when_starting_to_play.3F)**

END OF AN ERA
/r/all in 5 minutes nice
Someone please hold me
WHAT A FUCKING GREAT DAY 
To think I've been playing this game since 6.27, and if I'm not wrong, that version came out in 2005, it's crazy that I've really have been playing this game for more than 10years now and never actually stopped playing it, most of my friends gave a time and came back, but I really never stopped playing Dota.

Even if we have terrible matches with bad teammates, or even if WE ourselves had a terrible game of constant feeding, there's just something in DOTA that makes you want to keep playing and trying to improve harder and harder.

I truly think DOTA is one, if not THE most complete competitive game out there, with so many different heroes, different strategies, different itemazations, different patches, it's just trully amazing.

I mean, you can easily play in a match as a simple hero like Wraith King who doesn't require that much of reflexes and micro, and then jump into the next match and play a heavy micro hero like Invoker,Meepo or Chen.

But the one thing that I like the most, is how ever time someone here mentions Icefrog, you can see that the majority of the community respects and loves him, unfortunately he doesn't talk to us that much, but we don't mind it as we can see through the game that he truly loves us and we love him just as much, every time I see someone thanking him after a great patch I just can't help but smile, it's awesome. 

Thank You Icefrog, for the beauty that Dota has become.
WOO IM HERE FROM /R/ALL I DONT KNOW WHATS HAPPENING

Hey /u/wykrhm,

They said a big patch was coming. Didn't expect 7.00 though! HL3 replacing dota 2 incoming
I don't play dota, but I gave this an upvote because I like it when subs get on the front page that normally aren't.
I cried
/r/all in 60 seconds LUL
MY BODY IS FUCKING READY 
WE DID IT BOYS

IM CRYING HOLY SHIT I LOVE THIS GAME
Do I have to play Dota 1-6 to understand Dota 7?
I'm fucking crying right now. DotA 6.xx has been in my life for ~10-11 years of my life now. I remembered playing DotA1 when everyone else was switching to League, HoN, Starcraft. It's amazing how far we've come. 

Thanks Valve

Thanks Kunkka & Artgerm (those loadscreens!)

Thanks DotA2 Community. 

Thanks Icefrog.

So... I think we'll have hit top of r/all by the time this is posted. So for those unaware:

dota 2 is a game that has gotten its last update that really stirred the game up in 25th of april 2016.

Everyone has been eagerly awaiting this patch, as it also marks the addition of the first hero not present in the original dota game, Monkey king.

The announcement of the patch also made after one of the best dota 2 series of matches in a while, during the boston major tournament.

TLDR: EVERYONE IS HYPE AF!! GO WITH IT!!

Edit: spelling & formatting

Note: Kind community people added a bunch of cool info down in the replies. Do show them some love <3
Good luck Purge.
I come from LoL, but I got bored. Should I try Dota with this new patch? Whats different from LoL?
Hi, /r/all, don't mind us.
DotA is one of the best and worst things that has ever happened to me. After six years off loving Runescape I wished for another game I could love. Nearly 5k hours (in game and ask) later, I can say I was hooked from the first time trying it.
DotA is an incredibly simple, yet evolves into one of the most complex games ever made. The fact it is a free game means everyone around the world gets to demonstrate their understanding of the game and their potential to outsmart you for an hour whenever you sit down.
The game is incredibly immersive, and when you play, nothing in the world matters for the next 40 minutes. It is a surreal bonding experience and truely deserves every ounce of credit the fame grants it.
it's been 5 minutes and this is front page of r/all already, holy shit

edit: in less than 10 minutes this is the top post on all, holy fuck
Born too late to explore the earth. Born too early to explore the universe. Born just in time to see patch 7.00!
Is now a good time to try and get into dota?
BUT GUYS CHRISTMAS ISN'T FOR 15 MORE DAYS! 
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME SO FUCKING MUCH

I know this comment will never get read since it's almost 3000 comments too late. But I haven't been this excited in a long time. 
https://twitter.com/icefrog

IceFrog has returned. He's tweeting!
DOTA 2 TO THE END! THE STORY GOES ON!

Edit: Did we just get shafted?

so it went from 6.84 back to 6.83d

Literally unwatchable

HOLY FUCK ITS HAPPENING BOYS!

I DONT UNDERSTAND SHIT BUT FUCK IT IM DOWNLOADING DOTA^^^again.
[deleted]
is anyone up for compiling every image that's in the teaser? or is there an employee at valve or PGL who would kindly just share the images?

i love this fucking game
that trailer hyped me. I never played a game of dota2.
I just had a bodily reaction.
Jebaited

*TL;DR: FUCK NO I AIN'T DOING A TL;DR! HYPEHYPEHYEEEP! Okay, I just did.*

Welp, I did not want to sleep anyways. It is 5am here, I felt like staying up to see the Boston Majors be concluded and now my plans to hit the bunk after one pub have been ruined by this reminder. I don't know if anyone cares to read any of this, but I would like to take this moment to let us think of how far we have came.

My time spent with DotA1 was brief, so I cannot say much about those historic times, but we are reaching the end of an era, my friends. To get myself in the mood to write this little rant and to think where we are about to head, I am listening on repeat to [this piece of OST](http://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=RDewfr_Y_5g#One_Piece_OST_-_I_m_Whitebeard_%5Bextended%5D) from the anime (trigger warning) version of *One Piece*. The video comments include spoilers about the series, so don't read them if you wish to avoid series spoilers. 

As many of you know better, this is the first whole-number update we have had in eleven years! Another commenter here reminded me that this is the first patch ever since the game being transitioned under the care of our dear IceFrog. Also the first completely new playable hero in I don't even know how many years. TI 6 and more recently the Boston Major made me realize how far this game has gotten. No longer are we just a tiny mod upheld by a couple of geeks, but an actual multi-million video game with some decent exposure. Sure, we may not be as popular as LoL or CS:GO, but for a game with far more humble roots than those two and untold other big name games and with far less exposure, we have gotten really far. I remember DotA1 being this fun little hipster thingy, only played by a few-ish dedicated people and never did I think about if it would grow into anything big. For those few of us (not me) still from Ye Olde times, the times when Aegis could be bought and shit, I cannot even think how some of you must be feeling right now.

So much has changed since then and while most of us will agree that not all has been good, the changes do not appear to have killed our game for now, unlike many doomsayers have said, as our game seems to be slowly growing. 

To think that IceFrog and his few companions kept up with the Wc3 mod and stuck with it through the ups and down. While some left for LoL and other such events happened to split the crew, The Frog has stuck with us (unless we have been tricked for years!) all without demanding any praise or rewards, as far as I can tell. The alliance with Valve proved very benefitial and look where it has lead us! To Monkey King and multi-million dollar tournaments! What started as a cheeky little mod to a far more popular game turned into a thing of its own ages ago and has been mostly growing ever since. We could have never had any of this without the Frog, his unknown amount of beta testers and out car-manufacturing overlords. So, mad respects to all of them. I have some disagreements with Valve and The Frog throughout the years, but now is not the time for those! Soon some unpredictable changes and a new hero to feed as, what a joy!

This probably made no sense, but whatever, it is 5am and I am hyped. Peace and love, friends.
DoTA2, Hmmmm...

It all started when I heard about it in 12th grade, then forgot about it. Then in College I saw some people play and I was like, cool game i'll also try it. Was very happy when I found out that it was free. Downloaded LoL and DoTA together, played LoL and DoTA, dumped LoL and stuck to DoTA and never looked back ever again.And 4 years later with lots of LP/reports because of shitty power going off, gettin flamed for bein a noob(initially) and being an Indian. Had my share of hopeless matches,very tough ones going for 90 mins, gg ez ones, and my god the comebacks were sweet(1rax left and enemy all structures in base intact) people next to me were wondering why suddenly i'm shouting in joy (i'm a quiet person). It has pushed me to be ruthless, skilled, non-flaming(not to assholes), DoTA player. I always tell my team not to lose hope even when its hopeless. Thank you all for making me click the FIND MATCH button whenever I want to have fun, distract me from sad shit going on, thank you for making me want to play DoTA instead of smoking, drinking or fapping when i'm bored.

Thank you all for making this a wonderful game and community!
wtf volvo i have finals tomorrow can you just giff the fuckign patch so i can jerk off then study
I legit got goosebumps and felt myself tearing up after that whole reel and it went to 7.00. I fucking LOVE dota

I cried watching it live then jumped at 7.00. I'm from 6.27
15 longest hours of my life. Hello insomnia my dear friend.
Dev forum for Test build is open with a forum for [Monkey King bugs.](http://dev.dota2.com/forumdisplay.php?f=496) Hoooooooooooooo.
Never in my 3 decades would I have thought that a trailer for a damn patch would have made me tear up.

But damn. Having experienced most of the history in that video myself, either in person or vicariously... yeah. *sniffs*

So as someone who only had 100 hours in this game and that was years ago, hope do i get back into this? Just say fuck it and jump in with the new patch? Someone pls. 
Damn Valve hired Ninjas to cut onions! Bringing back those memories :') :') :') 

Dota/Dota2 has been a great part of my life ever since I am a highschooler. Those Bet Games, Those Tourneys, Those Heartbreaks and defeats, The feeling of Winning, The feeling of Raising that Trophy, the Gift Certificate(lol yes it was a prize then) to treat your friends/fam, The Pride it gives you, The Courage and the "push" that gives you to continue fighting for life, For de-stressing you, even up to now when there's too much stress in our life and in works, Dota always there to hug you and calm you and restart you all over again.

Thanks again Icefrog! love lots! and looking forward for more Actions and Milestones in life with you <3

**half life 3 released as dota 2 game mode.**
Never played DOTA but that trailer got me hyped for whatever this is
John "TotalBiscuit" Bain has passed away after a long fight with cancer.

Not trying to hijack this thread, but TB explained how he wished he went to the doctor after recognizing the symptoms he had. He instead waited for like a year to get checked out.

Don't ignore your health. If you have something like blood in your stool go to the doctors boys. RIP TB
When i was staring in dota 2, i was streaming for like 100 viewers and all the sudden i looked down and had like 20k. For some reason, TB raided me. 

I had never spoken to him before, and to this day i have no idea how he even found me. It was a moment i have never forgotten, and when i started getting a following i remembered that feeling and tried to close out my stream by hosting people as well and speading that positive vibe. 

I never got to thank him, hell i have never even spoken to him. But ill never forget how a guy as big as that could do something for a nobody just out of the blue. It taught me that gamers and this world we live in can be great.

Ill regret not thanking him for that day for the rest of my life.

Rest in piece John
[deleted]
Loved his Dota content with Purge and almost all podcasts and WTF videos, he was a true Legend!

I wish we got his announcer in Dota...

Rest in peace :( 
I think newer members of this community might not understand how impactful he was. He did a lot of content for Dota 2 during it's formative years, and I know a lot of people that got into it because of him, and still play to this day. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zhJ2iP4zkc

Still a favorite.   
I gave up on gaming media long ago, but I always respected that TB never sold out like the rest of them and wasn't afraid to shame companies that tried to rip off their customers. RIP.
He helped give us DendiFace. 

RIP a legend.
He died at the age of 33. Too young...

Anyone around at the arena tomorrow (I will be), shall we do a minutes applause at minute 33 of the first game or something?
You know how sometimes someone dies but you don't really know them, yet you feel like his/her death affects you anyway? This is exactly what I'm feeling. Honestly, Dota/Dota 2 has been part of my life for so much that anybody related with it, even in the slighest can affect you. 

RIP TotalBiscuit.
Damn thats sad. His videos with Purge got me hooked onto Dota :(
Oh shit.... that was kinda sudden to be honest i thought he still had a couple months left
Rest in peace. Can't believe we've already lost someone so huge to this community.
I have outlived the person who got me into playing this game.

Not sure how to feel about that...

Incredibly sad news. RIP :(
LUL emote immortalised
Sad news

I didn't watch too much of his videoes, but always love how he was fighting the consumer/customers fight and outlook of the games
Single draft disaster got was my first exposure to this game.Rest easy 
Good fight, man. Good fight.
I can't say I've watched a lot of his stuff, but the little I did was very entertaining and it's sad to see a man who's had such a big influence go.

Hope his friends and family are ok. Fuck cancer.
Fuck. This is fucking unfair.
Man was one of the casters that got me into sc2 and subsequently eSports. R.I.P TB
I feel like I lost a friend. Let's hope he gets all the last hits up there.
It's incredible to say it out loud but TB was, and will always be, a bigger part of myself (as a person) than most of my blood relatives.  
  
For as long as I live, I'll always try to do what he did, make the gaming world better for the gamers yet to be.  
  
S2TB!
its not fair
This is a sad day us all. The video game industry lost a huge influential great person today : \(
The guy who got me into the game. Watching him playing Rubick mid and understanding that he can steal Lina`s ultimate still makes me laugh. GG man
I remember watching this guy's videos regarding beta and alpha testing for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Guy told it like it was, which is rare in any industry these days. RIP CynicalBrit.
TB's "Hyper-incompetent Single Draft Disaster" videos are what got me into Dota 2.  I played Single Draft exclusively for the first year to learn the heroes because of it.

A few years later, once I knew the game pretty well, I went back and re-watched the series.  Turns out the advice he gave at the start "don't do what I'm doing" was *really* appropriate.  But damn did he make it look fun, and 12k hours later (!) I still blame him for the addiction.

R.I.P. TB, awesome critic and sub-par Sand King.
He was such a great man... an inspiration to all... even if you didn’t know him you knew he had a massive impact because of all the positive things he affected in the gaming community... RIP John... You’ll be missed
I am so fucking shocked. Man deserved better, he had such a positive influence on so many people. RIP TB you will be missed.
Too fucking soon, he was only 33 years old. He had a huge impact on the Starcraft 2 scene - I still remember watching his casts. Rest in peace.
Hopefully we can do something in honor of him, those gamers among us who've shared the same fate, and all the other folks out there currently fighting the good fight. Games like Dota 2, Starcraft and such have brought us all closer together, and not for nothing. I hope friends, family and community can draw strength from that.
R.I.P Totalbiscuit even tho I never really followed you I still think you brought a good chunk of people into this amazing game.
Thoughts are with his family. RIP TB.
Tb did so much for not just Dota but for gaming as a whole. He will be sorely missed. Rest in peace.
Where are our fucking WARDS -TB

My condolence to his family and friends. 

This is a big loss the the gaming industry. He was one of the rare breed that didn't "sell out" to the corporation but always aim straight and true. 
Jesus. I don't play Dota anymore, but I still keep tabs on this subreddit for the funnies, and TB is one of the ones I always look out for. I remember I used to listen to his podcasts, he was a great voice for the gaming community and always looked on both sides of the coin, I always loved hearing his opinions on not just Dota but many other industry related topics and other games. May he rest in power and rest in peace. 
RIP

Condolences to Genna and his family.
Oh shit. My precious boy is gone. Been a follower of him since the old days when he was in college and we were all playing Planetside. He got me listening to Machinae Supremacy and he was just an all around pal back in the days (even though he was a dirty TR player). 
TBs videos with purge got me into Dota 5 years ago, Rest in Peace.
Sad news. We will not forget him, his fight and his amazing work. Our thoughts are with his family and friends, big hug from Spain.
I feared for this day to come since he announced his cancer, his Dota 2 videos with Purge is what got me into the game, now I have 1500+ hours. Godspeed John Bain
Rest in peace. One of the legends in the world of gaming....

He fought till the very end and tried to live life as much as he could these last few months/years.
Fuuuuck i thought he was getting better😢
He got me started Dota2, through his single draft videos.

He made it accessible, he showed me that all you have to do is try it.

F
RIP TB, we'll miss you and your beautiful sleep inducing 1 hour reviews of options menus.
This guy was never a huge part of my internet life but I was always aware of him. I always thought this would just be another hurdle he would hop. 

I'm legitimately devastated by this loss.
You know a legend has passed when the top 9 threads on r/all are giving respects to 1 man.
Is he the “LUL” guy on twitch?
TB, thanks for the good times man, you were a role model to me... we will miss you, i hope you are on a better place...

fuck
No "LUL" today.. RIP
Press "F" for Fuck Cancer!

Good thing DramaAlert has already fallen from grace before wanting to report his death.

Edit: Wait what? I thought Leafy and iDubbbzTV cyberthrashed him to irrelevancy. I hope no one reminds him of that tidbit.
Itd be mad if we can have him immortalized in dota, TB was for the longest time one of the faces for esports 
Fuck man. This hit me in the feels. :(
Fuck cancer!!!!!
Such a bad news. One of my favorite SC2 caster and game reviewer.
Man i did not follow the guy, i know a little about him, and watched some of his videos on youtube. 

But man this hits hard especially because i lost someone with cancer. 

I wonder how much time does this freaking people with huge power on this planet will focus on real problems and putting more resources into this than going to fucking war.

I mean we have lots of technology, but i never saw something that were close on beating cancer, or close to find something useful against it. 
rip in peace delicious biscuit
Oh man... I'm going to miss him. I loved his WTF videos, loved his commitment to PC gaming and providing honest reviews, and I loved his SC2 content.

I never knew him for his Dota content, but I loved everything he did with SHOUTcraft, The Invitationals, Kings, etc. He was really the only reason I watched SC2.
Terrible news. Rest in peace TB, thoughts and prayers to Genna and family.
LUL but not laughing. FeelsBadMan
TB got me into dota, i've followed his battle with cancer the whole time, he never gave up, and he will be missed. fuck cancer man.
Fuck cancer
Not gonna lie, I really grew to dislike TB in his recent years, with the whole "are traps gay" debacle and other political views related bullshit, but I can't deny after watching weeks upon collective weeks of his content, the fact that I wouldn't be playing dota if it weren't for him, it's like a gut punch to see him go, even after his long and grueling fight with cancer. Rest in peace, you cynical brit...
This is making me tear up
His emote will forever be remembered
Fuck man.. that sucks... we knew it was gonna happen one of these days.. but still.. fuck
Rest in peace, TB. 

And fuck cancer.
I've had people I knew in high school pass away over the years but weirdly enough I'm more affected by this. Cancer is a bitch. RIP.
Havent watched his videos for years but I'll miss him a lot, RIP.
The one and only true LUL emote that is TB. RIP :(
RIP He was the best.
Im gonna miss him so fucking much, he awoke my analytical view on many gaming related topics, sigh, a black day.

Best wishes to his wife and son, also his many friends
It actually hits so hard... For someone who was technically a stranger he was a pretty big part of my life for quite while, he got me into competitive starcraft and as the result to a competitive games in general. In fact his Random draft videos got me into Dota 2. I also watch a lot of his videos back when I had time. Its so unfair to lose someone that young and talented, he was younger than me, damn....
Terrible news, This seems to hit me harder than the celebrity deaths over the last few years.

I will absolutely miss the fella.
rest in peace :\(

May his family have some peace and confort in the following months, this is tough.
Man, fuck Cancer.

Such a blight on this world, it always takes the good guys. Hopefully he is no longer in pain, RIP TB. Thank you for the content you delivered to us!
Is there a way to pay tribute?
This was the guy I followed when I was like 16 and in still was in HS. I binged his videos just for his rants and witty comments. The best gem I hold dear from him till this day is his Terraria playlist.
A huge loss for me spent a lot of my difficult years listening to him he was very fun person to listen just some hours earlier i was watching far cry blood dragon reviews and saw it it feels so sad now.
RIP. fuck cancer
I can't believe this.

His DOTA 2 series got me into playing this game over 5 years ago. I remember seeing him play broodmother which made me interested into playing DOTA 2. Then he did a video with Purge and that's how I found him and his videos. I still can't believe it.
Rest in peace John thanks for putting a smile on my face when i needed it
Omg I loved this guy, i use to watch his youtube videos all the time. Rest in peace you will be missed !
The one big reason I got into DotA 2 was his because of his Hyper incompetent single draft disaster series... We'll miss you TB rest in peace .
RIP, the great man he was.
My condolences to the Bain family and to everyone who invited Totalbiscuit into your homes/screens/battlestations/podcast subscriptions. Just to note at the great reach of a man lost too soon as of 21:05 Central time US the top 10 posts in r/all are dedicated to John “Totalbiscuit” Bain.  
I loved his reviews specially on steam sales , rest in peace 
Rest in peace John, you don't have to suffer anymore. 
maybe off topics but not only in dota.

player in warframe community are mourning him too by gathering in a relay. He gave warframe a chance, one of the first people who gave the support to warframe also. 

RIP
Heartbroken to see this.... RIP John... 
Can't believe people on Twitter are actually posting decades old screenshots of bad stuff he said or when he attacked someone and somehow justifying that he "deserved" this. The world is not just, people don't get what they deserve. A quick Google search will reveal that most dictators and tyrants who are responsible for the deaths of literally thousands are still alive and kicking, at times well beyond 90 years old. Shouldn't "justice" have been served to them? And yet a guy who just played games and tried to do the best he could to help the little guys gets served this fate.

I hate to bring this up in a moment of such grief but please please please if you have symptoms like blood in your stool, go and get it checked out. I had something like that a couple of years back, even had to get a colonoscopy done and it turned out to be just hemorrhoids. Don't wait. Do it for your family. For YOU. RIP Totalbiscuit, you will be sorely missed...
I remember Dota 2v2 tournament where pros played with talent. Him teaming up with Dendi was the best thing ever. Dendi even called his mother and TB had a lovely talk with her. 

RIP. 
Fan, follower, hater, he will be missed by all, he died way too soon. Sad day. Rest in peace

:\(
Sean Bean sounds quite similar to John Bain...

Anyhow, sad to see TB go :\( Did lots of good things for gaming in general, not just Dota back in the day.
I would never have touched Dota if it wasn't for him. Now, I have probably spent over 8000 hours watching and playing the game.

To say TB had an impact on my life would not be the beginning of it.
Ah yes. John "Get cancer and die" Bain.
I'm sorry but who was TotalBiscuit? I know I have heard from him somewhere, but can't remember
PepeHands FUCK CANCER
Oh no :(

The news I knew was coming, but never wanted to hear. RIP Tb 
What the fuck I thought we'd have at least another couple years. Fuck. 
I thought he was recovering

Well, not much to say except it's a damn shame
Rest in peace John Bain... :(

You were a hero, TB, people don't give you enough credit for that.
Sad after reading about all the multiplayer games he was going to be playing with his wife. 
rest in peace mr brit :\
He has a young kid too..

Damn, thats gotta tough
Holy shit... Holy shit... So sad.

Rest in peace
Oh my... 
Rest in peace...
RIP :(
man, that sucks :/
o7
Been a viewer and follower of John's for years before and after his Dota 2 content. He was certainly a force of nature in the industry, that for damn sure. 
Going to miss his videos.
RIP in peace TB :(
His videos introduced me to DotA2 back in the day and I've been addicted since. This hits hard. Truly an unsung hero for our community. Rest in peace John.
Rest in peace
:( I just remember him from WoW. 
...I have no words...WWTBD?  A shining example.
GNU TB.
Rip was a long drawn out fight
GG TB
Always enjoyed his work. I'm going to miss him. RIP Mr.Bain.
I found TB on YouTube a long time ago and he was playing viper, more like complaining about viper, and soon after downloaded dota 2. I loved his all of content and bought more than a few games on his recommendation. 

Thanks TotalBiscuit
damn fucking cancer. can't believe he is gone.
RIP the best twitch emote of all time
F for respect

F
Fuck man. Dammit...
rip
That's terrible news. I think TB was definitely a positive force for the gaming community and he'll be sorely missed. RIP. 
RIP
Is review were always objective... may he rest in peace...
Rest in peace, John. You're an inspiration to all, especially those of us who are cancer survivors. 
rest in peace
Fuck cancer. :( 
Oh my god what. I loved his videos... That’s just sad man.
RIP BISCUIT. 
*BOO DEE WOO BOO DEE WOO.*
Rest in peace TB, he is going to review all the games that were and will be in heaven now. We as a community, as many others too, lost a lot today.
Can u tell me who is this person? I havnt follow the scene for too long.
RIP I always looked up to you. 
R.I.P to one of the most well respected and influential members of the community. 

FUCK CANCER
Rip, I heard his name from another game (probably known from my id please don't bash) and didn't even know he's involved in the dota scene. Tells how much he's devoted to the eSports scene in general.

Although I don't know a lot about him, I'm sure he'd be missed.
I started dota only because his WTF is series damm I knew it was comming but I'm still shocked 
very sad, I admire the fact that he kept on tweeting critics till the end.
RIP good sir.
May he rest in peace. I hope his family and friends find the strength to endure such a loss.
My brother got me into him years ago, a class act who got many people into many games and always gave games a fair and honest review. RIP.
First INTERNETHULK now this. It's sad. But I will always remember that glorious tophat of yours! Rest in peace and know that you will be remembered as one of the greats by the gaming community.
Learned about some great indie games only because of him. Dude was amazing 
This is really the worst bit of news to wake up to. I always wanted to believe that TB would make it through alright, but man, fuck cancer. TotalHalibut, CynicalBrit, TotalBiscuit, Mr. John Bain, you really played a big part in my life. Back when I was playing on World of Warcraft private servers with my cousins (couldn't afford a subscription because 3rd world kids), your content really brought a lot of joy to me and so many more people.

Your gaming critique and casting really made me look at games differently, and gave me great insight to what makes a game tick - part of the reason why I went into animation. And I may not be a great caster at all, but your work inspired me to give it a try myself.

So thank you TB, for all you've done for gaming in general. Your voice and snarky remarks will be missed by everyone.

Rest in peace.
Two days ago cancer took my dog. I'm fucking sad as shit. Now i get this rubbed in my face. Fuck cancer.
Still remember the old SC2 content... TB was one of the key factors that got me into Esports. Thank you for all your work man, RIP.
<3 
Sad day for the gaming industry ... truly a legend has left us so young :(
Rest in Peace
Wow this is hard. I watched a lot of him, when I was playing starcraft 2 back in the day. He was a great guy, and I hope his wife is strong enough to move on. I lost my dad to cancer too, it fucking sucks:(
Im sooo sad to hear this. Great member of our gaming community has left us. 

He was the reason that got me to play Dota when i saw him playing with Purge a few games. He was pretty bad, but he was having fun so it helped me with my intimidation and anxiety.

RIP TotalHalibut, TotalBiscuit, TheCynicalBrit, you will be dearly missed
The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And he was the biggest of us all. RIP
Fuck cancer.

Fuck cancer players, too!
TB seemed like an amazing person with a genuine passion for what he did....


Him passing reminds me about TI6 with the Chinese man cancer victim in the hospital who also passed....

"May there be no illness (cancer) in heaven, only dota."
Always found this dude kind of a grating personality, but came to respect his hustle and perseverance. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be as strong as him. RIP to a legend 
You were to young to leave us, god damn man, to young ... rest in peace fighter 
As West World would put it,

“You only live as long as the last person that remembers you"

For TB I am sure his memory will be remembered for a long time throughout not only the gaming community, but as the internet as a whole.

If you want to support him in any way please take the time to buy a t-shirt/hoodie/anything from his website 

https://represent.com/store/totalbiscuit

He never wanted his family to live off donations when he passed and this is how we make sure they don’t.

Please take this as a lesson to stay on top of your health. If you sense anything is off please consult a medical professional; it could save your life. 


RIP TB I hope Heaven has a FoV Slider. 
I’m at a loss. The world just lost one of the best people it had.. 
Oh, man. That's so sad. I heard about this back when I played and followed Starcraft 2. 

RIP, TotalBiscuit. Condolences to the family. 
This is way too fast for me to handle. I heard he has lost like this month and then he is gone, just like that.
In my years as a gamer I have stumbled on TotalBiscuit on dozens of different platform and in relation to countless of games. I think our relation started with his involvement in Starcraft II and me watching tournament casts before going to bed. Then I found out he had hour long 'rants' / discussions on his YouTube\-channel with criticisms on a wide range of gaming related topics. His Steam\-recommendations list was always a good starting point when you were looking for a new game.

Long story short, TotalBiscuit was and will be a huge influence on the gaming community. Rest in peace.
TB gave me the courage to start Dota 2 4,3k hours later i have made so many friends because of him.

I can't even think how different my life would be without his Dota 2 videos.

Your legacy will live on.

Rest in piece John
Been watching TB since 2012 around the time he was posting his Hyper Incompetent Single Draft Disaster videos, which initially got me interested in the game, and then his collaboration with Purge is what really got me in to learning and improving at the game. 

This is actually really hard news to swallow. My thoughts are with all his friends, family, and also viewers such as myself that, despite never truly knowing the man, feel a profound sense of loss today, of a husband, a father, a son, a friend, and huge voice of reason in the gaming community. 
Aw shit what the hell. Just yesterday I was watching H3's [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozb2r7c0hxA) with him and he seemed to be doing alright. That's quite unexpected to me.
He leaves a big hole to fill with regards to game reviews. Nobody currently around has the clout or the balls to do what he did, and we (as games consumers) will be much the worse for it. 

He didn’t get me into dota, but I have watched his stuff on and off since he played Cataclysm WoW. RIP to perhaps the biggest gaming personalities of the last 15 years. Certainly the most influential.

Kuroky crying after the win is probably the most honest reaction of any TI winner ever
The East-West cycle remains unbroken

Well, that champagne opening idea on shocked players after 8 hours of Dota wasn't the best idea...
TI7 WATER THEME = LIQUID TI WINNER CONFIRMED!
3-0 in TI? No one has EVER done that in the history of Dota!

Liquid are playing so well, I've never been more impressed with a team's drafts throughout a tournament before. They have so many super comfort heroes and you can only ban so many, this reminds of other "unstoppable" teams.

Now comes the next part of the tradition, they get to suck for a while after this TI win!


Liquid played perfectly today. Definitely deserve the win.
The tradition remains
>Odd year = West

>No repeat team and player

>Humble Sanitation merchant cleaning out all the trash on the lower bracket

Balance is restored in the DotA2 world
It's crazy to think that Gh has only been playing professionally at this level of DOTA since November, and now he's a TI Winner.

With this, kuroky is now the most right dota 2 player this world has ever fucking seen

Seeing Kuroky tear up is probably the closest I'll get to feeling what it's like to win a TI
This was cool enough that I downloaded DotA while watching. I'm still not entirely sure what I watched, but I'm going to start playing tomorrow.
Congratulations to Team Liquid! What an amazing and historic run for Team Liquid coming all the way through the lower bracket to take down such a talented team in Newbee in the first ever TI Grand Finals clean sweep 3-0. Special congratulations to Kuroky for breaking his finals curse and keeping the East/West & no repeat TI Winner prophecies alive.

How many TI winners does it take to open a champagne bottle?
Liquid have put up one of the most outstanding International runs I've seen. They deserve this 100%
Kuro started crying when it finally hit him, God damn ;_;
Miracle knew he WOULD be a TI winner. Kuroky didn't know if he would EVER be a TI winner. It shows on their faces.
[deleted]
It only took Kuroky 7 TIs. 

It only took GH 1 TI. 

Don't know what's more interesting. 
3-0. Wow. Amazing job by Liquid, you guys deserve this.

Yesterday I high-fived Kuroky. Today he wins TI7.

High-fiving me has a 100% TI win rate. Moo narrowly missed high-fiving me last year, if only he had known. 
Kuroky deserved it, been a long road for him. I just hope my boy burning gets it too. We need all the dota 1 legends to win it.
This might be the single most impressive run I've ever seen in Dota 2. 

The drafting was impeccable. 
Kuro crying tears of victory ;_;

I'm so happy, one of the player who got me into the game finally won a TI. 
I'm legit fucking crying with the guys trying to open the bottles

people that play enough vidya games to rise to professional gamer levels are probably, at least introverted, and at worst completely socially awkward

that's not an indictment of the nerds - I'm just saying, maybe try to figure out a celebration event that is more their speed, rather than just handing them champagne and expecting them to act like formula1 racers or something

just a thought, gaben

Hey /u/Jokerofthepack,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
It's a sad day for Chinese dota player, and I just saw burning send a  Weibo:a little bit envy Kuroky. Everybody are blaming and insulting newbee teammates, because Newbee send IG to lower bracket who just beat liquid with 2-0,  three game losing is a huge damage for them career, hope they can come out of shadows soon. In China, if you can't win the champion, people insult you, if you lose the final after eliminate another Chinese team, people insult your whole family, it's so terrible. 
BTW, I thought ZAI and FY is the best 4, now I think GH
 Is a monster. 
Congratulations team Liquid. The new champion.
Sorry for my English.

Kuro crying he's so happy, seven TIs and he gets it at last, must feel amazing.
Kuro crying absolutely slayed me. ;-;
Shit I don't even play this game but ended up watching cause i heard Liquid's team was good and Miracle was some sort of messiah. Ended up tuning in daily not knowing tf was going on. That was entertaining as hell and the casters are awesome.
I know nothing about dota but I watched some games and that last fight was fucking nuts, man. Dude on Liquid murdered some guy, blinked to a spot and fucking smacked the next guy, totally badass sequence. 
Is Gh the best dota player rn?

KuroKy on his way out with the aegis BibleThump
So happy for their victory, absolutely awful celebration & beyond lol. 

Kuro was visibly emotional, I'm truly happy for that dude.
And now remember the season started with Bulba and a missed Major....

People doubted Kuro

People were asking why Miracle left OG

People said Liquid is a one trick pony 

People doubted Nahaz


Man, even I wouldnt believe it and doubted so many times but FUCK YEAH, MY BOYS DID IT!

Well good luck with that. 
I just won TI7 with 10mil :3

Interesting little fact:

At TI6, Wings was the only Chinese team in the top 4 and won.

At TI7, Liquid was the only non-Chinese team in the top 4 and won.
China? Where you at? Numba 2, 3 and 4? But not numba wan.

Kuro crying made me cry as well when I realized I've known about this player for as long as I've been playing DotA (warcraft days) and he really paved the way for me to enjoy a game and find new friends through it.

Its funny. From this interview, it isn't about winning. It's about playing Dota at the highest level on the biggest stage. They're addicted.
How the fuck. 10k upvotes in 40 mins. 
Congratulations! As a Chinese dota player, I cheer for the true champion of TI7. We also appreciate teams like LFY, which we didn't expect could be this good. Let's go Liquid! Let's go CN dota!
Never watched esports before this tournament, decided to give it a shot. After the Team Secret game I was a Team Liquid fan.

Hope I'm not bandwagoning too hard! I guess I just have to play the game myself now.
Team liquid fans, it's time for us to put aside this flag for a good while. Congratulations Team Liquid!

Massive Fabulous
This bottle opening is some great comedy. "Now I have two bottles" lmao
I am so happy.  Fan of Liquid since the team was created, raging at their falling outs, cheering even when they don't do well (not qualifying for TI in 2015).  
  
Goddamn this is a great night.  Please don't change the roster, this is such a great team with great people.
I never got much hooked with pro DotA before. I just started following Miracle- after he hit 8k for the first time, iirc? Dunno, but he was just *THE GUY* I followed, the other pros were non-existent to me until today, though I knew some names.

So TI comes, I check which team Miracle- plays in, cause of course he's motherfucking playing TI. Through out the week I had schedule troubles to follow on group stage and shit, but I just kept checking every night how Liquid was doing. On the weekend I spectate full games for the first time ever, following Liquid.

Comes today, they are 1 game down, and I just cheer them from home like I never did on an eSport, hoping they can come up at the end. Then into finals, worried how they could fare with exhaustion and facing the "I won everything so far" team.

And they completely obliterate Newbee, and I'm already waiting for the next TI and next Mayor to follow them again, damn this guys sold DotA to me like nothing ever had before.

Kudos to all the guys for some stupidly amazing games, not only Miracle- now, but also a Mind_Control I didn't even know before and now expect to see a lot more of, and the rest of the crew, they all played super, they outdrafted and outplayed people like madmen all day long!
KuroKy crying was so heart-warming to experience. A man who doesn't typically show a lot of emotion.
Having followed these guys since 5Jungz I really can't explain how amazing this feels. The post TI6 slump was hard but watching this team grow and seeing GH become such a phenomenon was unbelievable. Kuro finally got his Aegis and boy does he deserve it.
Kuro in tears, gotta be a good feeling.

Shame they didnt answer machine with "It feels like it weighs about 10 million dollars"
NAHAZ WAS RIGHT
Liquid winning an underwater themed TI. SeemsGood
"They can win a 3-0 in the Grand Finals but they can't open a bottle of Champagne"  

Champagne TI Winners confirmed!!
This is probably going to be drowned by all the other comments, but I'm going to post anyway.  

While I'm happy for Team Liquid that they won TI, as it was well-deserved, I just feel sad for LFY. Chinese Dota has evolved to such an extent that they're much better at teamfight and cohesion than any other region, and I believe LFY possessed the best of that. There weren't any easy games for Liquid, even in spite of the fact that they dominated the early game during Game 3 in their series. Liquid showed their ability to straight out end the game without ratting in their series against Newbee, but it was LFY that gave them the most difficulty. I honestly believe that if Alchemist died in their second game against LFY, it would have been LFY holding the Aegis. But luck was on Liquid's side, and they deservedly hold the Aegis. GH is a beast in the three heroes he's banned for, Kuroky is a great leader, and Miracle and Matumbaman have finally found the cohesion that had been wanting for almost a year. It took the team a long while before they got that synergy they'd been looking for. I'm nevertheless happy that they have been rewarded for their efforts.   

Still, I hoped for my boy ddc to win his first TI, but I'm glad he's not too sad about it. He's still $500,000 USD richer, anyway.

 It's nice to see Kuroky overcome the drama throughout his career and walk away with a big win! Congrats liquid!
Let's go Liquid! *Clap* *Clap* *Clap* *Clap* 
When Machine asked "How heavy is that Aegis" Matumbaman should've said "Not as heavy as Kuro"

No faults with their gameplay, but they need to up their joke game for next TI
Everyone talking about Miracle and Kuroky, but man, Gh was god the entire event, the real mvp (for me)
So happy to be a TL fan. Ive been rooting for them since Bulba's amazing clock game against LGD at TI3. Suffered through blogboys, not having a team for over a year, and the choke at TI6.

GOD IT WAS SO WORTH IT THOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!

GH = GODDAMN HERO  
  
--David "LD " Gorman
**KUROKY KUROKY KUROKY!**
Someone make the Kpii face when Miracle survives an emote or something please or at least just crop it
Team *Liquid* won the *water* themed international

I call it rigged
Predictions Tournament

This was requested by a user, who watches TI but didn't have an in-game compendium. The basic rules:

* Everyone starts with 1000 tokens. Tokens cannot be purchased. 
* You can bet on the winners of a match for 10, 30 or 100 tokens. Tokens are added to pool and split between the users who predicted correctly. 
* Predictions for the matches on each day will close at the start of the first match (so 3AM EDT / 8AM GMT / 10AM EEST for all days I think)
* All the predictions are displayed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/predictions) or by clicking the Predictions tab using new reddit. This feature does not work with old Reddit design unfortunately :/ 
* Prizes: pride and accomplishment of being at the top of the leaderboards.

This is the first time we're trying a relatively new Reddit feature so we may tweak things as we go.
The old vs new Reddit stuff is one thing, but the stupidest thing about this that Reddit did(I'm pretty sure mods can't affect this) is that as soon as you put in a predictionn it auto-upvotes the post, so it'll always show up as some insanely upvoted post.
lmfao "you need reddit premium to see what others picked" gtfo with this. surprised the mods dont ban it.
scumbag wont let me [ol.reddit.com](https://ol.reddit.com/) the link fuck that
Why the fuck is it on new reddit? skipping purely because of that
Literally can't use it in my Reddit app lol. (Boost)
New Reddit? Nope.
bet your house on elephant
What the fuck happened with the upvotes on this post? I dig the idea (even though Reddit doesn't let me see it in rif nor old.reddit) but you can't tell be the votes are real
WTF why is this still forced to the front page. What the hell Reddit.
pls never ever ever link to new.reddit.com
Hot take:

EG and OG wont reach UB/LB finals and will be eliminated before day 5.
You have to use reddit premium to view the poll result?
This is some shady advertising for a reddit subscription if I ever saw one.
All this new gimmick but still no flairs for T1, undying, team spirit and elephant -_-
new reddit is really gross looking
Wait.. the compendium and predictions are available to all players..

All you need to do is install the game and u have predictions..

I guess they don't have access to dota itself?
Undying vs Fnatic/
BC vs Alliance/
Aster vs Qc

Feels like hard pick :/
my eyes

disgusting link
This is a nice feature.
Next year it's a crypto called PredictionCoin?
"This was requested by a user, who watches TI but didn't have an in-game compendium"
That shit is free... gtfo
BSJ said LGD once so I’m saying LGD
I PRAY FOR OG’S DOWNFALL IN COLLAPSE WE TRUST
It doesn't work guys. I tried switching to new reddit but it still doesn't work. Do you need the app as well?
Its clearly IG
I don’t really find Predictions that fun because by far the best way is to go all in on underdogs and with 1 win you have more bank than you can ever spend
ARE THEY FIGHTING
Doesn't work on redditisfun app?
Secret fucking up everyone's bracket predictions. :P
I'm assuming there is no level 1000, actual medal in this year's compendium?  I haven't seen anything on it.
Upper bracket 2/2

Lower bracket 0/3 so far

F
OG has an uphill battle now and doesnt look convincing enough
I pick OG

I’m also ready to be disappointed .
Holy fucking shit I predicted every match correctly yesterday wooooooow, too bad I only bet 10-30 on most of the matches :D
he was incredible, it was a free kill?
OG!
[removed]
ofc first post freeking spoil .. thank you reddit you never disappoint me
No you got it wrong, Unreal Tournament announcer*
Oh cool reddit implemented gambling
so much money wasted valve so that you can't even see the international in good resolution on youtube
LGD will win ti10 But please ffs just ban tiny against them to make every game interesting.
Winners for day 1 in my opinion: Team spirit, OG, Undying, QC, BC, EG

winners for day 2: T1, VP, Undying, Secret
since the upvotes are automatically given and rigged, I suggest you guys giving them to me. tnx <3

I think I'll play frisbee while I wait instead.
/R/LEAGUEOFLEGENDS DOESN'T WANT THIS PIC OF OUR HERO RTZ ON THE FRONT PAGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK /R/TZ

How can League think their person is more compelling than RTZ? The boy came from a rough background and made the most of what was given to him. I met him once before TI4 and he told me his story. He said:

My name Artour Babaev. Sorry bad englandsky. I grow up in small farm to have make potatos. Father say "Arthour, potato harvest is bad. Need you to have play professional DOTO2 in Amerikanski for make money for head-scarf for babushka." I bring honor to komrade and babushka. 

He's just a boy trying to play some Dotes. Our boy.
They tried to stop our boy rtz but he is always [prepared](https://imgur.com/a/1JP24#tQz4GVy).

I saw Arteezy at a grocery store in Shanghai yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly and saying "LMFAO wHo cAREAS HAHA Xd".
When r/LOL is sending us their memers, they're not sending us the best. SAD
How come when I type DotA in League Riot censors me? But when I type LOL in DotA my character just laughs?
I heard League of Legends doesn't even have free herocare.

It's happening, my loins are burning, my nipples are hard, i gently take my penis out of my pants while i watch Arteezy go mid and build a Midas. I slowly start stroking it up and down. 40 minutes have passed, Arteezy keeps farming non-stop making max usage of the precious Hand of midas, he's the top farmer, i start speeding up, faster and faster, i get impatient and start using both hands. Arteezy is now 6 sloted. Finally he joins the fight, solo, only him, 1v5. Shit starts to go down...one kill, double kill, ultra, RAMPAGE, semen starts pumping up my penis while arteezy all chats about his rampage and ixmike congratulates him with a "grats".
R T C ?

T I 5 ?
Why do people automatically associate masturbating to arteezy with autism? I have been beatin the meat to his pretty face for over 2 years now and I don't understand how this makes me autistic. I'm a virgin, yes, but arteezy actually make me MORE likely to get laid. I have had countless conversations with cute, cute girls in my classes about how good he is. I have been able to speak to women for the first time because they want to know about the meme donations I made. I dream of meeting a girl called leasy so I can say "I love arteezy but I want a cute leasy", that is when I will lose my virginity. but I'm not autistic. I masturbate to rtc as often as I can. I have many friends.

I remember back in 1992, Artour Babaev came into the Barnes & Noble I used to work at and asked if we carried any copies of "Mein Kampf". It turned out we only had one copy left in stock, so he purchased it. Nearly on his way out, there was this little boy who looked no older than 12 years old who began to cry. When Babaev walked up to him and asked what was wrong the little boy replied that he had been saving up all the money he earned from his lemonade stand and was hoping to buy that copy of "Mein Kampf". Babaev smiled at the little boy, rustled his hair and handed the copy of "Mein Kampf" he'd just bought down to him. As the little boy grinned from cheek to cheek and wiped away the tears he exclaimed with joy "Thank you so so much Mr. Babaev, this was the nicest thing anyone's done for me ever! Heil Hitler, Mr. Babaev!" Before exiting the revolving glass doors, Artour turned back, nodded at the little boy and said "Heil Hitler to you too, little buddy, Heil Hitler...." Then he was gone. It's moments like that that really warm my heart and make me remember that there is such things as selflessness and unconditional kindness still left in this world.﻿
Arteezy sat in a dark room. The words "Dire Victory" filled up the screen. Not even Arteezy's shadow fiend could win this game. 3/8/7 378 GPM. Tears filled Arteezy's eyes as he carassed his hand of midas. The sound of hard core gangster rap and crying filled the room. The door creaks open and EE-sama enters the room. "You lost Artour." "You do know what happens when you lose." Arteezy removed his clothes, wearing only one of EE's anime wigs. EE removed his clothes, "You lost 23 MM. Thats how many hours your punishment will be." Arteezy spent the next 23 hours being furiously ♥♥♥♥ed by his mentor. After the punishment the ♥♥♥♥♥ covered Arteezy arised. "Thank you master, I can't wait to return the favor when you lose." Envy smiled. "So will I Artour."

The room is quiet as RTZ studies. After finishing a section, Artour decides to take a break, settling on Aui's stream. Arteezy pulls out his dick and tries to get off, but to no avail. "My boy is sad without a midas," Artour sighs. Just as he is about to put little Artour away, EE comes out of the closet. EE is in full morphling cosplay with penis in hand. RTZ looks at EE's dick and notices the hand has a golden shine. "M-M-Midas!" Artour shouts as he and EE cum all over each other

And then Dazzle graves and waves him to prolong his suffering.

I have dark thoughts.
My first experience with a MOBA was in voice chat; "You're fucking terrible. Uninstall this shit game, catch cancer by fucking a microwave, and die."

Oh, internet rage. I love you.
Sven looks like a dire tower
Cute Sven reminded me of the [ye kid](http://imgur.com/gallery/mVGccuK)
I kinda like comparison. Dota Comunnity right there.

Sven is a new player  smiling .He does not know what lies ahead and of course picks carry. 

Dazzle, who is a veteran guy, only smiles when He tells the new player to hang himself. He has walked down the path of flame and rage ( even now he walks it). He plays position 5 because he wants to win.


PS: Dazzle is a bad player too, with bad conduct and he gets paired with people that just started playing.
it was all cute at first but then i felt bad.  I genuinely feel bad for the new people who get tons of shit from Vets.   Whenever i see a new person who clearly doesn't know what they're doing in any game I play I have the instant urge to let them win.

Is this what it feels like to have a soul?  Dota has sucked nearly all of it out.

It's honestly funny because I expected a totally wholesome drawing but in the end it gave me what I expect most experienced players would act towards new players (as I have experienced before). :(

> Hi Mr. Carry.  I know efficiency is of paramount importance to you because you still have a branch in your inventory after the laning stage.  However, in this game we are dealing with a permanently invisible Riki and Mirana's ultimate ability.  I am holding sentries but I can't afford to place them willy-nilly given the largeness of the map and the poorness of my material person.  I was hoping you might consider replacing that branch with dust and perhaps using one of your two additional empty inventory slots to carry a TP so that you may conclude the game with an impressive KDA knowing that your incredible individual skill is reflected accurately in the statistical summary.  This is only a suggestion and I hope you have a very nice day.  
Level 15, can confirm this is true. 
YEE
There should be beginner and veteran queues. 
Literally laughed out loud, 10/10
This is so sad :C
Saddly, thats not how it works anymore :(

no, its great. i absolutely love it.
BUT HOW DID IT GET 12.1k!?!?!?
So wait im supposed to drop those branches after a while?

This was perfect. Loved it! 
lol what a crackup !!! i cant stop laughing

Dota is not a "pick up and play" game and that's why so many of us appreciate it.  
A . at the end of the "Hang yourself." would have made it a lot more powerful :p
you made my day !!
Good shit.

What does a branch do anyway? I am a noob need help.
Kawaii
Came here expecting something like : git gud. Not disappointed.
is that a dazzle?
You should make a short film version lol. I'd vote for it.
This is the sort of thing that made me quit Dota. I don't have literally hours every day to devote to Mobas, I just like to play a game or two every couple days. Dota has such a steep learning curve, I spent 8 hours on the game, and never even felt ready to play against real people.
AAaaaaand this is the reason I stopped playing Dota. I'm only here to lurk.
I remember my first and last hour of playing dota 2. "Hang yourself" was the nicest this that was said to me.

1. OG is losing

2. Starts spamming Lakad matatag

3. ???

4. Epic comeback out of nowhere
Ana went god mode holy shit
Topson the dota 2 professional career speedrunner
A 6 year gap between 7Mad's TI appearances.  
Topson's first real LAN.  
Ana's first LAN after a year break where he fucked about playing position 4.   
Insane that they formed just over a week before the open qualifiers and they fucking won.   
This has been the best TI. 
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT MAN JERAX IS THE BEST EARTHSHAKER* IN THE MAP EVEN WHEN PLAYING RUBICK 

edit: sorry i was too agitaded to even write right
TOPSON 100% TI WINRATE POGCHAMP
what the actual fuck is going on

how did this happen

i aint complaining though, i rooted for them all year. but seriously, wtf
Imagine being topson. Just a pubstar 2 months ago trying to break into the pro scene.

Jerax calls you to play for a team 2 weeks before TI, you reply "I'll be there tomorrow"

Now you've won the Grand Final at TI8
ana is a fucking god. jerax's rubick was also on point.

edit: due to many comments telling me to not forget ceb, i'd like to point out that ceb too is a god
THE MAD FLOWER DID IT

https://i.imgur.com/EciY5yI.png
OG, The laughing stock for the entire DPC season, went through all the hardship possible, abandoned by co founder, closed to disband before ti, here they are, lifting the aegis, the true phoenix in the dota history.

OG gave me the life lesson to never ever give up and OG becoming my favourite team now.
I saw the groups and I saw that OG can get 12th, something that the team can be satisfied with.

I saw their bracket and I saw that OG can get 6th, something that the team can be satisfied with.

I saw the rest and holy fuck I love this game.
Ana is pretty good at this game. 
NoTail becomes the most accomplished player with 1 TI win and 4 Major wins to his belt

Gone is the West - East Trend
CURSE = BROKEN
Their unusually chaotic play style really won them TI. Oh my god. 
7ckingMad just won a TI WutFace
Ana had one of the best single games I've ever watched
THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP 
TIs won:

7ckingmad - 1

Arteezy - 0
How the fuck did they do that
"To Tal and Gustav,

You guys have been amazing teammates, and I will always cherish the memories and achievements we share together. I would be lying if I said I was not feeling a great disappointment. Nevertheless, I wish you guys best of luck and many future successes. The journey, at the end of which we would have won a TI together, brutally comes to an end. But the end of a journey marks the beginning of a new one.

After the rain comes the sun, right?

Today’s sunshine has been more beautiful than ever. I am lucky enough to be surrounded by incredible people, and be assured that we shall build OG back up, back to where it’s meant to be."

\- 7Mad
 You are playing against OG.

You cannot ban Lakad Matatag since there are no chatwheel bans.

OG spams Lakad Matatag.

You lose against OG.

You still cannot ban Lakad Matatag. Normalin, normalin...
That's the biggest cinderella, story I've seen in years. Topson's first ever professional LAN. The ex-coach. Look at them after the game, they look like they got the victory handed to them and they are standing in disbelief, they don't realize what just happened. So fucking happy for them
For those of you coming here from /r/all here are a few things to note:

*  OG, a team which many people thought would place below 8th have just won TI8 with a prize pool of $25,000,000+.  OG themselves walk away with $11,000,000+ of the prize pool.

*  This team was formed only 3 months ago when most of their "good" players left to form a team with EG who placed 3rd.

*  Among those who left was Fly who played pretty consistently with current OG player Notail for around 8 years.  They were considered best friends but Fly (and S4) left hours before an important LAN, causing OG to not be able to attend.  Notail has not commented but it's obvious he was not over this and extremely upset about it.  This was shown notably after OG defeated EG 2-1 in the upper bracket resulting in [this handshake](https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessLitigiousTireSeemsGood).  

*  Every TI thus far had alternated from an East/West team winning.  OG winning breaks this curse.

*  One player from OG, Seb  (aka 7ckingmad) was retired and was their coach for a while, he came out of retirement earlier this season.

*  Another player from OG, Topson, was barely known before joining OG 3 months ago and made less than 4k before today.  This was also his first LAN ever.  

*  An additional OG player, Ana played with OG in late 2016 and in 2017.  They won 2 majors (important LANs) and were a favorite to win TI7.  However they lost to LGD, whom they faced and won in this TI, placing in 7-8th.  After this Ana announced he would be taking a break from the competitive scene.  He returned in early 2018 with little success and re-joined OG 3 months ago.

*  Notail and Jerax (N0tail and JerAx) have been with OG during multiple iterations.  Notail joined during OG's conception in 2015 where the team saw it's initial rise to fame where they won two majors that year.  However after a disappointing TI6 result Ana and Jerax (among others) joined the team in 2016.  

*  The grand finals of TI are a best of five series.  This series went the full five games, the only other time this has happened at TI was 5 years ago during TI3.  However, 4 of those games were considered fairly one sided.  Nearly every match this series was a back and forth brawl.

*  To win this they defeated LGD, a team which were heavily considered the favorites despite losing to OG in the upper-bracket finals 2-1.  LGD was dominant the last few months defeating many teams considered to be the strongest in the game.  They placed third in the DPC season, essentially making them considered the third strongest (for reference OG was 14th).  LGD also won 2 majors this year.

ANA YOU HAVE DONE AUSSIE DOTA PROUD
 ‘OG’s gonna get cheesed by some random OQ team’

‘Wind and Rain gonna claim another spot for NA’

‘18th power ranking’

‘They’ll never make upper bracket’

‘2-0 easy win for VGJ’

‘EG gonna send OG back to the dumpster’

‘No way they can match LGD skills’

'they was lucky in UBF, quick 3-0 inc' 


Now here they are winning the T fucking I in the first 5th game in the last 5 years, defying all the odds in this universe.

Who else is crying, im with you. almost 3 years with this flair.
Comeback Kings. So many impossibly deep holes they dug themselves out of. Really the team of destiny. 
Fly: "Did you win TI?"

Notail: "Yes"

Fly: "What did it cost?"

Notail: "You."
The cycle is broken.

Best. TI. 
This is how our team enviroment is like. Bigdaddyn0tail is screaming in the mic:" BIGDADDY BIGDADDYYYYY BIG DOOOOODYYY YEEEAAAA IM" GOING INNNNN". I'm yelling "GET ON MY LEVEL HOE YEEE NEVA EVA NEVA EVA YOU CAN NEVA EVA GET ON MY LEVEL HOE" everytime I kill someone. Ana is spamming Alt Left-Click on his gold to count it every second, he's also spamming Alt Left-Click quickbuyu on Midas to remind us every second how close he is to buying Midas while me and n0tail are yelling at him stop counting your money Aussi and don't buy midas or we'll lose. Meanwhile Ceb's spamming "Are you lost?" on the chat wheel while typing "That's happens when I rush" every other second. Alas we have Topson aka "DogSon" aka "You will never play competitive" playing Monkey King and I think he muted all of us.

Now you might be thinking:"How the hell does a team function like that? Let alone win?!". Well that's because this is the environment Godson- is used to playing in his 8000 Ranked MM games. He ends up playing Monkey King or Pugna and carries the game 1v9. We are simply re-creating the environment in which he excels: TopGod + four 4k mmr teammates
i'm a massive NBA fan and i think my excitement watching OG's run this TI rivals how exhilarating it was watching the cavs win in 2016. OG's journey has to be one, if not the least likely triumphs in esports history given all the adversity they've faced the last couple of months. 

ana being 19 years old (i know sumail was younger when he won but ana's performances were just absolutely unbelievable), seb's surprisingly expert offlane play, notail's extremely swift adaptation to 5, and topson.. topson was pubbing for shits and giggles merely 4 months ago and is now a TI champion. 

as an outsider, it appears as though all of OG's players get along wonderfully and had this unconditional calmness to them. it seemed like no matter how grim games looked, they'd miraculously claw their way back. that resiliency is borne of more than just their collective talent in game, it's gotta be a byproduct of their camaraderie as a team. 

massive props to OG and thanks for the outrageously entertaining grand finals.
This finals was amazing. The best finals ever in my opinion, better than ti3 too. But the most important thing for me to say here is how incredibly impressed I am with OG with all the stuff they went through before the international to get so far as to even win is absolutely incredible. And the fashion that they managed to do it in? Game 4 it looked like they had lost and same for game 5 and they STILL found ways to turn it around. 


The reason for this is because they play so unpredictable and unorthodox compared to other teams, theres nothing cookie cutter about them. Look at the 5 heroes they drafted in the final game 5. None of these 5 heroes are high prioritized or picked very much. Not even a single comfort pick in the meta. Incredible, and very well deserved.


Congratulations OG! This international was AMAZING. ❤️
I love that they raised the Aegis facing the crowd, that's class! For the fans!
[deleted]
What an amazing series! This is honestly one of the best TI's through its entirety--Group Stage upsets and surprises, then the massive underdog story with OG through the Upper Bracket coming face to face with the TI Curse against PSG.LGD in the Finals--and then breaking it with multiple great comebacks and amazing plays (not to mention the broken OG storyline coming into TI). This TI was exciting from start to finish--what a tournament. This is the pinnacle of Dota 2 and why we all love this amazing game!
Chinese fans are going to fucking flame the life out of LGD lmfao
Wtf OG has plot armor

Hey /u/Chanman00,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
unfucking believable... so happy for n0tail. i wish i could get a glimpse into what emotions fly and s4 are feeling right now lmfao
It's unbelievable. This is the best grand final since TI3 and I'd say it's actually better. And while LGD are the obvious favorites, I cannot believe how well OG play. 

Left to die by Fly and S4, I doubted that OG would even qualify and obviously I didn't even consider them to do well on TI, it was like one of the first "teams" to get knocked out because OG didn't even look like a real team compared to the favorites.

Holy shit, what a performance and synergy. I never rooted for them and I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon now but it would be insane not to respect OG, the Punished Notail and their whole story on this TI. 

I'm happy I watched it, I'm happy that Dota is still alive with such amazing esports.
Two things were clear to me in this series.

1.  Fy is called Fy God for a reason, he was incredible

2.  Ana is a top tier carry, maybe the best in Dota

Very happy for Notail, I have cheered for him since he was in Fnatic.
Puppey: Go kill yourself

Topson: When was the last time you won The International?
"He's a good player, a bit overated in my opinion. But defenitely okay to be in a top team! To say that he is one of the best solo mids etc is really exageration, he played like 10 games in a high level LAN, you need way more to compare him to Dendi, s4 or FATA"

- TI8 Winner Sebastien 'Ceb' Debs

Means a lot more now.
We live in a world where Topson is a more accomplished player than Arteezy. OMEGALUL
n0tail the cursebreaker
Ceb stepped the fuck up for this series.
Imagine being the laughing stock the whole season. Then gets gutted at the end by having your 2 members.

Having to scratch over and walk your way up to qualify. And ends up winning The International. 

Holy Fuck.

Congrats OG.

I don't even play/watch Dota. That was fucking INTENSE.
4 Majors and 1 TI.

GG WP Notail.
In the end, I feel like this was the best International yet for a lot of people. At least it was for me, as someone who's been following the pro scene since 2013.

After TI6, which was amazing, everyone was disappointed with TI7's production. It felt quite uninspired in comparison to the previous year and people were worried that Valve were losing the passion to make the event truly special. The games were very good and Liquid's run was something to behold, but the whole event around it felt like it had taken a step back.

However, this year's tournament brought the production back to a really high level. Maybe it still didn't have *quite* as much personality as TI6, but it was definitely a noticeable recovery after TI7. The panels were the most questionable part of the event, but everything else was great... It was smooth sailing the entire main event with barely any tech issues, the content pieces were great, the All-Star match was really fun despite its length, the reveal of two new heroes (one of which is out now!) was very exciting... The Late Game show with Pyrion and Wheat was so cool, the support for Sheever, the Gaben announcer pack... Hell, even the cosplay finalists were amazing this year. Also, the opening ceremony was really good and the closing of the stream has definitely been one of the best EVER.

And then there's the games and the storylines. Those have been simply insane this year. OG's run and ultimate victory was one of the most unexpected and exciting things we've ever seen in Dota. The grand final went to five games for the first time in five years, and it was in my opinion closer and even more exciting than TI3's (yes, I've said it). It cannot be understated how incredible this final result is for OG. And they broke the TI prophecy as well by winning in a China year?? Mind blowing. LGD were a fantastic team as well and they gave us quite a show this year, mad respect to them.

The main takeaway for me is this: If anyone was starting to doubt Valve or Dota, I bet they don't feel that way at all right now, tonight. And that's what matters the most.

I am truly thankful for having experienced this. I love this game.
*"It seems that all of the glory and legacy OG accumulated early this DPC season has all but sloughed off. Picked clean of all but one of its charter members, N0tail and Jerax’s reformed squad features faces both familiar and fresh to the OG brand. Still, they managed to cobble together enough skill to handily take the lone European qualifier slot for TI8. In years prior, such an achievement would be laudable, but outside of the regions’ titans the qualifier scene in Europe has been more or less a joke. Don’t believe me? Consider the EU qualifier’s top 4: three glorified stacks that didn’t even exist a month prior, and a struggling Kinguin squad. The only other result that OG has put up with topson and friends was a 3:2 loss to Immortals - an NA team that isn’t even attending TI8. For a team with a history of underperforming at TI, expectations for OG are at an all time low."* Ranking: 18 out of 18

REEEEEEE

- OG haters
LGD kinda threw the last game with that roshan, there was no need for that when they where so ahead. But OG just refused to lay down and came back once and once again. Props to them they broke the curse.
Jerax played the best Earthshaker of the game.
Did anyone notice during Game 5, in the teamfight right before LGD attempted to take the first Roshan, there was a double damage run top which Notail denied with a Treant. If it hadn't had been denied, Ame most likely would have got it when heading into the Rosh pit, and they would have taken Rosh before OG could retaliate. 11 Million Dollar Deny.
Fly isn't sasuke, Fly is Itachi. 

Fly sacrifices himself to remove the curse from OG, he joined EG bringing S4 with him. 

He's playing the bad guy, while being hated and being called traitor by the people.

BEST TI FINAL (no bias) ANA IS A FUCKING GOD OMFG LETS GOOOOOOOO
Where were you when China year is kill?
I just can't comprehend how a 19 year old can have so much balls. This kid is playing like he  queued with some friends way below his mmr unranked a Friday night, not really giving a fuck, chillin' with 50hp in an almost certainly lost game just to make some plays for "fun". Except its the TI fucking finals with 11millon dollares on the line.

And not just one game but multiple fucking games... I would have just layed down and cried under that pressure. This Anatham.. 
Im fucking crying. 

They deserved this so much after this hard year and these amazing performances. 
5 am and im screaming my lungs out ❤
As an australian I can say without bias this was the best TI
That Rubick carried game 5 so hard, holy shit
TI8 is my favorite anime. 
As a Chinese, OG winning this TI is probably the only result I could live with.

I really wished that LGD didn't make so many bad decisions in so many games, yet they just paid the price for their youth.

​

Congratz to Notail and OG, you really deserve this one!

​
I DOUBTED THE FUCK OUT OF OG. I THOUGHT THEY HAD NO CHANCE WITHOUT SPECTRE. THEY WON. I THOUGHT THEY HAD NO CHANCE WITHOUT PL. THEY WON.

THESE MOTHERFUCKERS ARE A TEAM OF DESTINY.

> **TURBO MODE**  


> Dota Turbo has been added to the search queue. This new game mode keeps the same rules as All Pick but shortens match time by granting more Gold & XP to heroes; making defensive towers weaker; and reducing respawn time. Turbo's relaxed rules and buy-anywhere shop system allow for casual, quick matches perfect for trying new heroes and strategies, or introducing friends to Dota in a more forgiving environment.

The change regarding the 10 bonus Heroes is completely baffling. Random gold is one thing, but getting a bonus based on picking from a certain hero pool randomly set that day? I really hope it doesn't affect ranked.

This is the most exciting patch I've ever seen
Ninjaboogie on why SMG kicked him

This is worse than all of Eternalenvy kicks combined yikes.
If that's actually true and main reason for a kick... No words, just... no.
SMG and kicking their pos 5, name a more iconic duo

First is Mushi, then Roger, then Ninjaboogie
What the fuck. This might be the absolute worst reason for kicking a player in dota history
I actually did get fired for losing a loved one and asking for a temporary leave to go to the funeral. 

If anyone in the US has kids/families that use Booster for a school fundraiser, behind the scenes they are the absolutely SHITTIEST company and know they’re treating all of us like garbage
didnt midone's dad passed away during his days with secret and he took a month break or something if im not mistaken?
that's pretty fucked up.
What the hell
Super rough for him. Just hope he can bounce back to a better team.
Best revenge would be joining another team and eliminating SMG. I'll look forward to it.
If this is true then SMG qualifies for r/trashy
It wouldn't surprise me, since Midone was very quick to convince everyone to kick Mushi from his own team after joining SMG. Like, Mushi extends an olive branch and he casually kicks him rofl.
Couldn't they just bench him so he can get some time to grieve?

There's no reason to kick the guy for bs reasons like this.

But there's also a case to be made that making a guy play when he has personal problems to deal with is also wrong.

Just bench the dude so he can have some peace for a bit.
What in the world


FUCK SMG

One of the scummiest things I've heard in dota shuffle history
SMG reputation ruin speedrun Any%. (World Record Attempt)
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
I got fired from a job for almost the exact same reason. I was keeping them updated for *months* on how my grandpa was doing and my boss would check in with me to see if I was okay because some days were harder than others. It felt nice having someone to talk to. I told them I'd have to leave for a couple days and he was okay with it. I'm driving 6 hours and I get a text 4 hours into my drive
"but when will you be back?"
"I'm not sure, I'm headed to the hospital right now"
He passed when I was 15 minutes away. 
The *next day* he asks me to come in. I tell him it's a 6 hour drive and the funeral is tomorrow. I can't do that. 
"6 hours isn't that much, you can just drive back tomorrow"
"No, I can't do that."
"Well were going to have to let you go there's too much work here for all of us, this was very irresponsible ans selfish of you"

I was a dish washer for the night shift. 

I sued and he got fired, and the place shut down like 6 months or so later. I think he also got arrested for *drug drug* possession so that's neat :) eat a dick José
one of the cornerstones of the Filipino Dota 2 scene and this is the treatment he gets, goddamn  


our hearts go out to you and your mother, I hope you find peace (and if this horrible occurence is true, justice) in all this
Hoping he finds a better team. SMG sucked anyways.
Well now I guess SMG gonna be most Hated team in this scene , as this time people should support him but no they manage to do the most fucked up thing...
There's no fucking way SMG would straight up say to their face "yo ur mom being gone might make you go full emo, and that's exactly why we're kicking you"

I seriously hope this isn't just ninjaboogie just projecting stuff, but whether this is real or not, there's no way this is going to come out good for either parties
Lol who awarded this with a wholesome badge
As someone who also lost a mother to cancer, this is mega scummy.
Okay thats... thats fucked
JJ Lin is the owner of SMG btw
If true, completely classless. What a horrible thing to do to someone. They should be supporting him.
MoistCritikal just dropped a video about this, so there's gonna be a lot of people hearing about this. 600k views already:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fII7Bw8ppYM
I lost my mom to cancer when I was 17. My deepest condolences to Michael and absolutely fuck SMG, I can't put into words how I feel about them doing this, the worst insults I know are not enough to describe it.
He is the nicest pro i have met in a ranked match very upsetting if this is the whole truth
Fuck cancer
Surely there is more to it than this. It'd be crazy fucked up if that was the sole reason.
FUCK SMG, FUCK MIDONE, PIECES OF SHIT
Literally top post on reddit now. Damn. Is this the biggest dota related drama ever? I think it is.
I find it a little disturbing that I'm going against the reddit consensus here. But proof?...
That’s why I don’t tell my job shit. Nobody knows my birthday, anniversary…nothing. No I won’t be your work Facebook friend or join your LinkedIn. Just leave me alone and let my personal life be personal. If it’s a last minute funeral I wasn’t expecting, you just call out sick. 

(Protip: If they require a doctors note to take a sick day, find a new job. They suck at life.)

If I need a day off for a funeral and I have enough time, I just take a vacation day and they don’t need to know about what I’m doing. No matter what my plans are, my answer to every question is “camping”. 

“Oh, taking a vacation day? Doing anything fun?”

I’m camping. 

“Oh, cool. We’ll call you if any emergencies come up you need to handle.”

I can’t. No service. I’m camping. 

“Oh, ok…”

It worked out well when I was in the military in the 90s. They think they have a right to work you 24/7 and be up in your personal life. When dial up internet was a thing, I just stayed connected all the time so they couldn’t call me back in on my days off.

And when cell phones came out it was even easier. 

 “Hey, we tried to recall you from your leave but you never picked up your phone. You need to pick up your phone or I’ll be forced to give you a Letter of Reprimand”

I was camping. No service. 

“Oh, carry on then……you sure like camping a lot.”

Yes, camping is excellent.
Holly shit the number of "the company did what was best for them" bootlickers in here.

People are not numbers or resources, if someone's loved one is dying or dead the only fucking thing you as an owner or manager should be doing is rearranging schedules or arranging for a temp unless that person tells you otherwise.
Just wtf. If they are that worried about his performance, just let him be on temp leave or move him in inactive. To fire an employee during his hard times is sooooo fucked up.
i feel so sorry for ninja boogie. its such a dumb excuse, that it feels like "affecting his performance" is a cover up excuse for a real one.

P.S im not insinuating anything. i loved watching ninjaboogie since Faceless and always thought he was a good player. i just think no one in the right mind would give that excuse unless theres an even worse reason
Why didn't they put him inactive or on temporary leave? My condelences to you and your family Ninjaboogie.
Imagine trying to show up to play competitive anything while your mom is about to die. If you don’t hate your mom that’s pure wack.
I think people are misunderstanding: SMG would not have outright said it. I imagine it going: Ninjaboogie confides in them that his mother is in her last days, apologizing for behaviour for the past few days or something. Then, a few days later, management or whoever talks to him about "poor performance" with soft language and basically asks him to leave. And then they can just be like "woah it isn't about your mom, it's about *performance*!"
He explained the situation further, so I guess there is no doubt left, SMG really made a worst decision possible. Sometimes people for the sake of corporation, greed and money can really attempt to do truly heartless and inhuman things. Guy lost both his parents. I really don't know how to even offer my feelings on this.
They even restricted commenting on facebook announcement post. So just ignoring hate they get?
Team Suck My Giantdick. What a dick move.
This can't be the real reason, probably just an excuse.
For everyone says by that his behavior as a result of his mother’s cancer is possibly why he got kicked and not the worry about upcoming performances, it’s worth remembering there’s a middle ground. They could have benched him, picked up someone new, and then run try outs with him again in some future scenario. Kicking him here is a soulless thing to do, and even bad for business I think in an esport that OG and Spirit seem to have proven requires an atmosphere of friendship for peak performance.
SMG can go F themselves 

Sorry for your loss Ninjaboogie if there's a 1% chance that you're reading this.

No one deserves that kind of treatment when a family member is on its last days.
I feel like this isn't the whole story. But if it is he has grounds for wrong dismissal.
I find this reason to be extremely improbable
Thats disgusting
Holy fuck. That's a new level of heartless
no idea why they wouldn't just leave him in an inactivre role, but it could easily be him projecting as a coping mechanism.
This is so fucked up. 

Rest in Peace for your mother Boogie
SMG.Suma1L
"Team" ... you don't kick a player for suffering grief. You support them instead! Bad move from the "Team" here.    
    
That wouldn't be accepted in any professional world.
Makes sense
Something something Doublelift
Welcome to America.
This 100% is a false explanation.
What?

That's the worst thing I've ever heard in quite a while, and that's when we have an Amber Heard trial going on.
They just use that excuse. Any excuses they will use either as explanation or basically at least something for reason. Probably dont want kick without reason.
Can’t imagine losing your mom too soon while you’re young. And then a dump truck of salt is poured into the wound by getting fired from one of the things in your life you probably turn to for coping. Imagine wanting your teammates/org to be there for you but you get the exact opposite. This is so shitty!
Haven’t been following the scene but… how has he been performing? Like it’s never cool to kick someone during a bad time in their life… but also it’s real job and if you underperform for a while you need to make a change good or bad time. Now how they treat him in terms of compensation etc. Will be telling of the org
JJ Lin better write a song for ninjaboogie's mother.
In one day this has become the 11th liked post in all of DOTA2 history.  Please keep liking and make this number 1 to show support for Ninjaboogie and to gain lifetime awareness for the awful Org that is known as Team SMG!!!!
As a Malaysian..I am totally disgust by this behaviour..I wont claim that they are based in Malaysia after this
Don't you have the same rights like other employees?

I mean I guess in "normal" jobs you can't fire somebody because of this reason.
I can't come to believe this! This is beyond pathetic.

Perhaps they wanted to kick him already and they were just looking for an excuse? Again it does not justify anything!!
We can only do is speculate
Don’t watch DotA, but what a fucking shit show this situation is.
They actually kicked their best player lmao, that's fine. Free wins for other teams.
Dude... That is actually SO unethical


I mean... Fuck. Who acts like that? We need to be human beings above all
I first thought I was on r/antiwork
Why does everyone instantly believe this with no proof provided? I'm so confused by these comments.
okay, this is one situation where im okay with twitter cancellers jumping on this
[what a bunch of assholes](https://i.imgur.com/Ni5FGYt.png)
it's just wrong
Ninjaboogie to replace Kuro copium
I think ninjaboogie has his opinion and SMG will have different. Hard to believe that SMG would do that because of this.
I... seriously do not get why someone would be kicked from a team because they're about to lose a loved one. Asked not to participate in an upcoming match, sure, but kicked from the team? That just feels incredibly short sighted and needlessly dickish.
If this is true, then SMG should be banned from all competition
Ether was SMG needs to die quickly from cancer. How cancerous is that organisation?!?
Did they at least give him huge monetary benefit package and support after being kicked ?  
  
I understand being kicked due to incoming performance issues, but he should still be well and truly looked after and treated with respect in his time of need.
MidOne seems to be a pretty toxic teammate so yeah this checks out
This is from ninjaboogie, I wrote it out for him just now. thanks for the support he'll come back better than ever I'm sure :D

If this is the real reason, SMG is shit.

Hope Ninjaboogie takes the time to grieve & recover first before grinding again. Any SEA team would be lucky to have him as a 5. Condolences good sir, know how you feel.
Smg sucks big-time
Wow. If this is true, then I hope SMG will crash and burn in div 1
This actually made me sick. Just wow...
Shitty situation but curious what was the right decision tho? Some say bench him, but till when? After the 3rd DPC season? After the Arlington Major? I dont think SMG can afford to be switching players at that point. Also there is no way a player would be unaffected from the loss of a parent.
This has happened to me as well. My mom is still alive but there was a period that she had to be taken to the hospital and I had to be constantly be with her. This meant less time to do my job and I got fired. I know it's shit but from company perspective, they are doing the right thing.
Like i understand benching him or something, but fucking firing him because of that is really fucked up. Damm.
Fuck that team and it’s entire roster. I hope they lose every game from now on.
The Organization that did this was Team SMG.  Can find them on Twitter as @TeamSMGofficial.  The game is Dota 2 (@DOTA2 on Twitter).  Their sponsor is Nescafe.  The member they kicked was @ninjaboogie.

You wanna do the right thing?  
  
Step 1, provide a reply tweet  to their goodbye tweet of @ninjaboogie.  Tell them how you feel about their decision.  
 
Step 2:  go to @ninjaboogie and express your condolences on the loss of his mother. 
 
Step 3: Tweet @dota2 and let them know how you feel about Team SMG and the treatment of their players and how it reflects on their professional esports scene allowing an organization like Team SMG in continuing to participate. 
 
Step 4: Contact Nescafe and file a complaint at https://www.nescafe.com/gb/contact-us .  

An organization like Team SMG should have no sponsor, no esports scene to play in, and should know exactly why they are POS.  Then as a good human and gamer tell @ninjaboogie he made the right choice.

What the most fucked up thing of this whole situation is, Team SMG could have been actual heroes.  Wholesome.  Loved by every gaming community with one simple move, supporting their teammate who still intended to play and not miss any events.  Instead they will go down in history as being the biggest POS gamers to ever exist.
RIP
WTF I hope SMG and to the members who agree to kick NB will never find success in dota
He got proof or just speculating 🤔
Super scummy if it's true, but I'm also not gonna openly believe one person's word on the matter.
He could probably take them down in a lawsuit.
Not that I'm defending SMG but there are always 2 sides to every story. I'm sorry for your loss man. But I'm sure that they had good intentions for their actions.
It is wrong but again it's business

Moral and business don't exactly goes well together

Not commenting on wrong or right, point out the obvious
I mean… He must feel so bad, cant even imagine. His situation sucks, and his reaction is understandable. On the other hand, a tragic loss like this, obv affects your output, and there are some players on SMG who’s having one of last (if not the last) shots to make it to Ti, and make lifetime long grind “worth it”. You dont wanna miss an oppurtunity for a case like this. If you are smart enough, u realise that there was no right decision, Only a logical one, with moral issues, and an empathic one, with potentially a negative outcome, that costs you a whole year, and one of your last chances. 
I feel Sorry for NB, but they did what the goal required.
It's not a job, it's a team.
This is one of the reasons why SMG is not a successful organization. Not just in DOTA but in other esports they venture on.
Good reason to kick but this guy seems more sorry about being kicked than his mom dying. Fking stay with your fam not in dota
We dont know the full story, potentially it was just leading up to it, and I'm sure if Ninjaboogie was top dog player like topson or something they wouldnt kick him without asking if he's fine first. Im sure the fact that he knew he might get kicked already made him play worse

I know its out of topic but why is it always TNC whos always late or last on announcing roster changes when they are one who is in dire need to shake things up
i feel they could’ve just benched him first knowing what happened.
He got fired because his job involved a prized competition.

I think if he had an office job or other common job he was expected to show up right the day after the funeral.
award for the most hated team goes to..
wow, SMG just got one anti fan from me
Literally the sigma grindset
Esports nerds pretending they're playing in the Super Bowl and not clicking on heads in a room with air conditioning.
I thought this was anti work and it was an employer and not a Dota thing
And I thought League of Legends orgs were a mismanaged shit show!

Y’all need unions.
they need to be cancelled
Given how people act in my unranked pubs, I view this as an acceptable response.
Gotta let everyone else know that Dota is more hardcore eh?
Not a good look.
WTF THAT IS SCUMMY AF
He should honestly sue them for wrongful termination if he can
Wtf
Smg will still be moving under gunfire i think?
Can he sue them? I mean its not reasonable
If this is the whole story it is a really really disrespectful move. 

Getting a lot of [heat](https://reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/utwftf/player_got_kicked_from_a_professional_esports/) already.
Fuck SMG

Fuck MidOne, moon, ragingpotato, and ah fu
That's fucked
Damn Bruh... SMG did just died too?
That is a terrible boss. When I was 18 I got hired for my first job ever. Very early in the morning on the day I was supposed to start my mom died unexpectedly. I called my boss when the place opened and was allowed to start 2 weeks later no questions asked. I was only planning on asking for the day off. That's a good boss.
Yikes.  I hope this wasn’t the case.
SMG - Swapang, Mahina, Gago.
Ninjaboogie doesn't need to be treated like that. That's insensitive and lack of compassion.
Smg is trash
Stop support for smg
Team SMG: rubbing salt in your wounds when you are at your lowest
Awesome, now another reason for people to hate the Dota 2 community even more. Fucking idiotic decisions ruining a beautiful game
SMG = SO MUCH GONEWRONG
This just goes to show how toxic the dota pro scene actually is, all the players should consult with a professional lawyer before signing a contract with any of the orgs inorder to protect themselves from these shitty situations.
if this is actually true life is so unfair man its so unfair
Pure evil. Genuine evil.
One thing for sure is that midone and smg is gonna be cursed and won’t make it to majors or TI xs
Rough my brother. You are talented and I am sure you will be picked up soon❤️
God damn despicable. Esports really is chock full of slavers and conmen if this is allowed
just singapore lang being realistic, lacking empathy... fking cmi
Guess they’ve never seen players put teams on their back in memory of their loved one.. happens all the time
This is some Bill Gates and Paul Allen level bullshit
So this isn’t acceptable in traditional sports, why is this acceptable in esports?
Yo wtf 😳. They should disqualify the shit out of them.
