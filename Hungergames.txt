My friend did pretty good on her costume for the premiere. What do you guys think?

[deleted]
I would love to know how she did it/where she sourced the butterflies from - I am going to attempt this for a con next year. 
She's smiling too much! That scene was [CF](/b "almost too emotional for me to appreciate") that outfit. 

edit: spoiler tag? I didn't think I gave anything away. 
Kudos for not using "nailed it" even if applicable.  
I think it's awesome!
Holy crap! I love it!
Stunning! So fabulous.
Even her eyelashes seem spot on! Love it!
10/10
Stunning
This is 9 years late but best Effie cosplay I've seen lol
How coincidental, I saw a lady, older than your friend, I believe, wearing the same outfit. It looks so great, she did a fantastic job!
Well it's kind of cheating if she just takes the costume from the set...
But seriously, this is amazing
Beautiful! Effie's got some real competition. 
Amazing! Well done to her!
I actually think she did pretty well
NAILED IT
well, i would hate to be the one to sit behind her

Did y'all go to Malco Grandview for the premier? I work there, and I saw someone that looked exactly like that. 
:O!!!!  Amazing!!!
AMAZEBALLS!
Yea, it's "pretty good" 
Yea the more I look over it the more I feel like it's Photo shopped on. All the butterflies are in exactly the same places on her collar, head and body, like the picture was flipped and several pictures were used, cropped and put on an existing picture, then saturated or something. It's TOO on spot. 
Haymitch's Favorite

More HG memes please!
😂 it’s funny but you gotta think, he feels so bad for basically just throwing Peeta under the bus multiple times, he always saved Katniss
The accuracy in this meme is astronomical
This is way too accurate
This is how imagined Haymitch for the first time.
HAHAHA
I’m so happy I found this page 😂
Haymitch is Gordon Ramsey 100%
Well,Peeta doesn’t act like a stubborn ass seeking confrontation all the time🤷🏾
I think Katniss would have been better off as a donkey
This is what happened when Josh Hutcherson showed up at a Kentucky Wildcats basketball game.

At first glance I thought his shirt said "Keep Calm and Starve." Figured it was a District 12 shirt I guess...
Was anyone shot?

That's a pretty epic response from the crowd!
But... but, they're doing it all wrong!  It's suppose to be the three fingers on the *left* hand!  
Is it just me or does it look like everyone's doing the nazi salute
LEFT HAND LEFT HAND
Was the the U of L and UK game? I know Ms. Lawrence is a Cardinals fan...
I loved when they did this! Always proud of a ky boy!
He looks kinda like Adam Sandler...
I love my school!
PEEEETA!!! 
Heil Hitler!
this gave me all of the feels
He frequently visits my local Starbucks inside of Kroger when he's "home" and went to my high school. From what I hear he's a douchecanoe. 
Hate his fucking shirt. 
Who the fuck is Josh Hutcherson?
Three in the pink and none in the stink. Classic.
I just found this really funny and fantastically in character

You’re telling me this isn’t what happened?
Oh I guarantee it...lol
I love Malone! One of my favourite actresses ever since I saw her in Contact as the young Jodie Foster.
Holy shit that's my new headcanon now
Suzanne and/or the movies definitely should have added this. It would have been comical, but also give us a good first impression of Johanna
This is canon now.
damn i wish hunger games wasn’t so pg this would be perfect
This is so Johanna Mason! 😂😂😂
I hope so
YES!!
Haha thanks for this. I love Johanna
Man, this is my new quote. *proceeds to yell it out and gets smacked by my mum from such profanity*
I love her.
Omg that is so in character lmao
And then she goes and identifies herself as having no gender.
Josh is hilarious

Remember, he made her pee her pants.
Makes good sense actually. I know when I read a book, even if the main charature is a guy I still put myself in their shoes through out the adventures going on.
...I did that for real actually

Edit: ok 1: i’m a girl and 2: i imagined *myself* as Katniss
They're amazing actors and so funny when they're by themselves, but watching them interact, you'd believe they've been best friends their whole life.

When I'm feeling down I watch some interviews with both of them, and it immediately makes me feel better
Ughh, I love crystal
2020

OH MY GOD I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT 2020 THAT WAY THIS IS GENIUS.
Oh my god I love this. Also there are 12 months, just like there are 12 hours on a clock.
This is great. Now we just need to find a mockingjay to make it all stop!
We better not get murder monkeys
Exactly
That was my thought too, and when I told my family about it they all judged me
Is someone tracking the horrors every month? 😂
I knew I was seeing some similarities 🤣
So why is July going to punish us with?
where's my peeta and finnick then? if were gonna be a in dystopian society then we might as well get the hot men around here
Oml ye
Her entire species has to be... eliminated
I’ve been saying this to everyone in my life! I say that it’s like the clock arena but every hour is a month and you can’t avoid the plagues
Tick-tock! 😬
As long as someone hovercrafts is out of this fucking mess at the end, I can deal. Tick tock
Plutarch: We don't need to destroy her, just the image, then we let the people do the rest.

President Snow : What do you propose?

... 

Plutarch Heavensbee : She's engaged. Make everything about that. What kind of dress is she gonna wear? - floggings. What's the cake gonna look like? - executions. Whose gonna be there? - fear. Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces. Show them that she's one of us now.

Yeppppp. 

Plutarch has even designed what we see. We’ve had our happy videos right in the middle of our floggings.
Oh god oh shit the beast
Yeah, June has brought crickets to Utah
I found this comment yesterday and completely lost it

That sounds about right.
🤣
LGM : The Claaaw !!!
😂😂😂 winning comment right there.
💀 💀 💀

You made my day😂😂
That’s hilarious. Easy highlight of my day lmao
LMAO! OMG, I laughed so hard!
AGSJAGSJAHDJSHDKZ I CANT GET OVER THIS
Haymitch: Dammit, another Finn.
That comment tho-
Trump looking at all the BLM protesters like

Nothing makes em madder then to see people unite. They want us to fight one another, we are stronger together
atleast snow isnt fat and orange and balding lmao
Me watching my nOTP like
Lmaooo 😂
May Trump not be like a Snow also on other issues...
MFW I see a couple displaying affection in person.
BLM isn't a meme
Do we have to politicize every fucking subreddit?Jesus
Dozens were killed and there was millions of dollars in damages? There’s countless videos of people setting fire to businesses (some minority owned), looting said businesses, and throwing firecrackers and Molotov cocktails at poor and helpless people just trying to save all they got left. How could you be so naive?
Try and tell me this isn't true

I think everybody would love a book on Finnick!!
Can confirm I turned gay the second I saw him
~~I want him to destroy me~~ He's such a great character
when he died a part of me died too😔
I mean, I think we can all agree Finnick is god tier 😂😎
hes hot as fuck and a great character in general
Finnick is on my list of favorite characters in all of literature so I heavily agree with this
The fact that Snow prostituted him out kills me 😭 the games really take everything from a person
I tried so hard not to love Finnick, I knew he was going to die. My favorite character always does. But I lost myself and I did love him. He was truly a hero.
A book on Finnick would have massive potential to do really well. Whilst Ballad of Songbirds was good, the underlying issue for me was that I could never root for Snow knowing what he became. With Finnick, you could start on the morning of his reaping, how he won the games, how the Capitol used him (all the secrets he learns), mentoring Annie... Most of all, he's a character everyone can get behind making for a much better reading experience.
[removed]
Finnick is a god of a man
That's a sandwich I could get behind
Agreed. Finnick was one of my favorite characters in the books and movies. His backstory as a prostitute under President Snow was horrifying, and it made me sympathize with him on a whole new level.
I cried for him when I read his death and then i weeped over his scene in movie... 😭
I didn’t like him a whole lot for a while. I couldn’t understand why everyone loved him so much. But my appreciation grew over the years.
Finnick will forever be in my heart.
People only ever dislike peeta or gale because they ship Katniss with one or the other. Though really the vast majority of the fandom prefer peeta from what I’ve seen
Rip 😭❤️
IDC Peeta is ma baby
Gale for Katniss. Finnick for me :)
Everyone in the capital sure did. Several times over, in fact.
I won’t
This gives me 2013 vibes and makes me reminisce of my days when I was obsessed in middle school and ran a RP account 😥
Facts.
Couldn't care less
I liked Peeta and Katniss, but damn Katniss and Finnick also worked…
We all know where this is going.

And then there was that woman who was maced and kept talking about the revolution, I was like “pack it up Katniss Everdeen”
I can’t wait till the reaping. I feel like America will go with a more bold 12-25 age range
Lol yes except it's different when they are doing it in support of a tyrant.
These chucklefucks would be fighting for the capital
Hunger games fans always be like: Suzanne Collins predicts the future again.
Except instead of fighting a fascist, they’re supporting one
I could not believe that young woman crying about getting maced and saying it's the revolution. I was like I bet she thinks she's the Mockingjay!
This is immediately what I thought of lmao
Where are the bombs this time around?
It obviously is super different but every time I said ‘the capitol’ I thought of the hunger games because I’ve never called it that before irl 😂
Except now they’re supporting the tyrant who’s orange for some reason
If they start the hunger games... I VOLUNTEER
Reposting my comment from another thread, because necessary. 

It’s not as simple as that. I have thought about this a lot recently so I will try to explain. 

There are more parallels than you thought, and your attribution of characters is flawed. 

To summarise:

Snow: Trump. Seeks capitalism, yes. Has his followers. But ultimately has reasons behind actions. The obscene wealth of the capital is undeniable and its power oppresses the outer districts.

The death of rue leading to the district uprising: BLM

Police (in some capacity, not all): Peacekeepers. Show brutality. 

But then, what everyone does not consider..

District 13 and Coin: The democrats and Biden/Harris. Just consider the propaganda videos = mass media outlet bias. Overtly people pleasing, but very different behind closed doors. 

People blindly rally behind district 13, the rebels, who we think are the good guys because their cause makes sense because the capitol is “evil”.  I am not saying the capitol is unflawed in any way, but 13/democrats makes the alternative sound soooo enticing. The reality is far from that truth.

The people of 13 (read: us) are happy to live on gruel in grey jumpsuits, because they believe they have a cause. It is all in pursuit of “equality”. But in reality, all the leaders of 13 want is power. None of it is for the people.

What will eventuate is socialism, then communism, with an even smaller elite group who hold all control over the people. 

We need a Katniss, but now it is too late.
I'm actually listening to these books and I'm on mockingjay and it was literally my first thought when I heard the news.
THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT TOO!
Hunger Games and Back To The Future. yeah yeah.
I thought about this
The inhabitants of Rome:
I literally text my dad when that was happening saying doesnt this remind you of the last hunger games when the rebels infiltrated the capitol!
Hey you guys know how panem is what’s left of North America? It’s starting....
Difference is it wasn’t staged on hunger games
