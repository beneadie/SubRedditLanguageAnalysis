EVERYONE WHO TURNED OUT IN 2020 NEEDS TO COME BACK OUT AND VOTE IN 2022
Never won the popular vote, got impeached, lost re-election.

This tool likes to call himself “your favorite president”. LOL.
As German I understand how a country can be scarred by fascism, I'm glad you guys managed this. It's a step towards a better world.

But the work is not done, the price of freedom and democracy is constant vigilance. I hope you can bring those who are lost back into the fold, compassion, love and empathy is the way forward.

It's been an absolute honour F5ing with you guys

Edit: Thanks for the awards and the kind words guys.
Reiterating, the work is not done, you'll have to vote like this in every election and especially the senate run off that's coming up. This is just a single step, there's a long way to go.
Let us not soon forget that this victory was never guaranteed. We need to vote like this, every time.
Trump is living the 2020 experience - got Covid, lost his job and will be evicted
LMFAO they called it minutes before Trump's conference
[removed]
The Fight ain't over 

GET WARNOCK AND OSSOFF TO THE SENATE!
Is this the most awarded post ever?? It's gotta be up there
We can also say goodbye and a hearty fuck you to Giuliani, DeJoy, Devos, Pompeo, Mnuchin, Barr, Conway, and his entire group of gremlin children among others. 

A group large enough to make some sort of evil softball team is getting the boot. Beautiful day.

Edit: Was told I made a mistake leaving out Ajit Pai and I definitely agree. The list is long of people I hope we never see or hear from again.

Edit2: Many have pointed out my glaring omission of Stephen Miller. This far-right white supremacist and anti-immigration Trump sycophant was [ready to double down](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-reveals-aggressive-second-term-immigration-agenda-n1245407) on his position in a second term. A lot of the beauty in our country comes from our diversity in both the landscapes and the people.
I live in Georgia. My vote mattered. 💙

Edit: I am so thankful for all the awards, but please use your money to donate to the campaign of Jon Ossoff or Raphael Warnock. Or donate to Stacey Abrams' group to empower disenfranchised voters.
America is about to find out how crazy an abusive boyfriend can be when you dump him.
0.5% in PA settled it. That was their magic number.
Everyone is celebrating, but guys, don't forget:

#There are two runoff elections in Georgia which will determine Senate Control for the next 2 years! And the registration deadline is approaching fast!

Energize your friends, raise awareness! This is the one shot you guys have to have a progressive government!
No more Betsy Devos, no more Andrew Wheeler, no more Ajit Pai, no more Mike Pompeo, no more Elaine Chao, no more *William Barr*

And **no more Donald Trump**

Edit:This was a quick comment off the top of my head missing a long dirty laundry list of other people we can see leave.

No more *Mike Pence*, no more *Louis Dejoy*, No more *Stephen Miller*, No more Jared Kushner or Ivanka, No more Hope Hicks, no more Wilbur Ross, no more Ben Carson, no more Mark Meadows, no more Alex Azar, no more Chad Wolf, no more David Bernhardt, no more Eugene Scalia, no more Steven Mnuchin, and no more John Ratcliffe.  This list probably still isn't exhaustive, but all of these are people who's tenure has actively hurt America, either through corruption, or denial of science, or promoting bigotry.
"Oddly I don’t feel like celebrating. I feel like Tom Hanks towards the end of *Cast Away*. I'm really happy the ship came but I don't want to party. I just want to take a shower cut my hair eat a shrimp find Helen Hunt deliver my last package and figure out the rest of my life."

-Chris Rock
ABC calls it! CNN calls it! MSNBC calls it!

FOX IS NOW CALLING IT! AP IS CALLING IT! BBC IS CALLING IT!

CBS HAS CALLED IT! NYT HAS CALLED IT! EVEN BRIETBART HAS CALLED IT!

EVERYBODY IS CALLING IT!

&#x200B;

THIS RACE IS OVER!
EVERYBODY GET IN HERE! Now we celebrate.
PA CAME THROUGH!!!! 😭 😭 😭 BRB About to sob happy tears
[deleted]
So this is what true relief after four years of anxiety feels like. We still have a way to go but I’ve never felt more hopeful.
Donald Trump is the only president to lose the popular vote twice.

What a fucking loser.
Someone give the guy on CNN a hug... he and the rest of us need the emotional release right now.
Van Jones: "It's easier to be a parent this morning."

Fuck yeah, Van.
Time to get to work in GA prepping for the runoffs!!! Let’s fucking do it! 

And VOTE in 2022!! Keep pushing these fascists back in every election! After four years of this BS, I will never vote for the GOP for any position. Fuck the GOP.

Edit: If you have off-year elections, vote then too! Vote in every fucking election! VOTE!!!!
Donnie, you’re fired.
Raise a glass to FREEDOM 🍺🍺 

Edit: Biden, do not throw away your shot.
Sometimes I wander over to conservative forums to see how they are reacting to the Biden presidency. They question our sanity like we question theirs. And I have to ask myself: am I equally brainwashed?

And then I think about what matters to me: civil rights, equality for all, closing the gender wage gap, the right to control my body, saving the planet.

Who is fighting for these things? The GOP? Certainly not. What other option is there, then, to vote blue?

If Democrats are a cult of people fighting for affordable health care, LGBT rights, a reasonable living wage, worker protections, affordable childcare, breathable air, then fine. I surrender to the cult of blue.

I stand for the future of humanity, whether you are red, blue, or any other political affiliation. I will always vote for these ideals of my own free will.
 If you live in Georgia, this election is not over. Remember, the executive branch is only a third of the three branches of government. The fate of congress lies in the senate runoff in Georgia. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, you will have no excuse in 4 years time to say Biden was a good or bad president if you don't make your voice heard. The fate of the Georgia runoff WILL determine the senate control. VOTE IN JANUARY. If you are not registered to vote, you can still do so up until December 7th, even if you did not vote in the general election.
I'm here for the history.

Fuck Trump.

Fuck white supremacists.

Fuck the GOP.
I find it hilarious the right acts like boring old moderate Joe Biden is some apocalyptic figure. They elected a pathologically lying, zero experience, failed businessman and reality tv personality but didn’t see anything scary about that.
Ty you guys for helping me keep my sanity
Can you just imagine what a boost this just be for first time and young voters?

Instead of your candidate losing and feeling g disillusioned with the whole process, instead of feeling like your vote doesn’t count. You vote in a place like Georgia and not only do you flip a deep red state, but the margins are small enough to make it absolutely clear that your vote REALLY did matter.

I can imagine every single one of them is now an impassioned voter for life.

The added drama from how it unfolded as well, this whole journey, the memes.

What a way to get people to buy in to the voting process. That’s incredible. What a brilliant feeling that must be.

Van Jones crying on cnn is all of us. Here's a [link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/nov/07/cnn-van-jones-tears-joe-biden-us-election) since so many have asked. 

One more edit: thank you all for the gold. Please wear a mask if you're going out to celebrate. Wash your hands and consider donating some money to your local food banks because Congress ain't doing shit now until January and people are still suffering and hungry out there.
Donnie out golfing when the news comes in. Poetic justice.
As a millennial, I’ll always have Trump to thank for truly getting me interested in politics. I now understand that I can’t complain about what is going on in this country without also participating to make things better. I am a software developer by trade and I even want my next job to be in a company that deals in this space. Here’s to a bright future in which we are all participating in our democracy!
Fucking finally
Donald Trump..

You’re fired.
Donald Trump - GONE

Michael Pence - GONE

Mark Meadows - GONE

Steven Miller - GONE

Bill Barr - GONE

Edit: THIS IS THE TOP UPVOTED COMMENT IN THIS THREAD, BY A LOT
[removed]
Great day for democracy. Just donated to New Georgia Project Action Fund and set up a weekly recurring donation for Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Let's help GA to get the senate majority.
After posting in all of the threads this week, and I've said it numerous times, you have no idea how grateful I am to everyone of you. My heart is filled with nothing but gratitude at this moment, gratitude for all of you for posting, for being there, for listening and for kind words, for calming my anxiety when I started thinking the worst, and most important just for you being you. I love you all and I hope that we can all heal from the damage that has been done over the past 4 years.

This is a fantastic day for all of us. How does it feel to be on the right side of history?
I didn't vote in 2016. I fucked up and thought Hillary was a shoe in. I've spent the past 3.5 years trying to right my wrong. Voting in every election, hosting stand-outs, volunteering with multiple campaigns from the local level, to Senate and Biden/Harris. 

*"If Biden doesn't win, will I be able to say, in complete honesty, that I gave it* ***everything*** *I could?"* was the question I lived by since he won the primary. I'm sitting here by myself crying. I'm so proud that DECENCY won. I'm so proud of the volunteers I've worked alongside, who have so much passion and spent every day working for free to try to help make things better. I'm just really, really happy, but it's bittersweet. We need to come together, because united we stand, divided we fall.
Congrats America! Celebrate! Have your champagne (we deserve it). But DONT get complacent. Don’t slip back into the comfortable routine of ignoring government. There are over 70 million Americans out there who are still a part of dumpster’s cult. And they are pissed. Help them. Or disagree with them. But whatever you do, DONT FORGET THEM. Because in 4 more years, their next candidate may be a SMART sociopath. 

In 4 years, we have to be as enthusiastic about that election as we were this one. We can’t lose America to the cult.

Fuck Trump. Fuck fascism.

Democracy wins.
Dear 17-year-olds who live in Georgia: if you'll turn 18 by January 5, 2021, you're eligible to vote in the run-off election that will be held on that date. You have until December 7 to register to vote. #FlipTheSenate
Well this will be the most upvoted post on Reddit
It’s over. It’s finally over

EDIT: Just so everyone is aware I meant the election because it seemed like they’d just never confirm Biden. I know there’s still a lot more to do.
Everyone get in here!! Biden is our next President. Stay safe, celebrate and do the Biden Boogie!! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g7qdPXPKG8&t=82s
I'm a grown ass man... Iraq war vet... and I'm on the verge of tears. We made Trump a one term president. Thank you America. Thank you so much.

Van Jones crying on CNN.

That's makes it official.
Independent voter checking in. I take my voting seriously, and have always weighed my options on both sides of the aisle, though I wish the two party system would go. I will never vote for another Republican for so long as that party exists. A party that cannot acknowledge the basest of human rights has no place in modern society.
Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris. The first woman of color elected VP in US history!
I voted absentee, from Florida living in the Middle East, and while my vote for Joe didn't contribute to the win in the electoral college, it does count towards that over 74 MILLION vote count for the 46th.  I have voted since legal in 2000, and I never felt my vote was needed as much as this year. The Power of the People!

I’m about to have the biggest cheat day to celebrate.  

Lunch: Chimichangas (AZ) and a side of fried cheese curds (WI)

Dinner: Philly cheesesteak (PA), Shrimp Cocktail (NV), and peach cobbler (GA) for dessert.
The "fuck your feelings" and "Hillary was a sore loser" crowds are doing some amazing displays of hypocrisy currently.
So this is what true relief after four years of anxiety feels like. We still have a way to go but I’ve never felt more hopeful.
That’s real emotion coming from Van Jones.

The CNN election team is amazing.
From the NY Times:

> Jodi Lavoie-Carnes, 48, a dental hygienist who lives in Dover, New Hampshire, supported President Trump for re-election. She was shocked and disturbed by Biden supporters, who had gathered in her town waving profane anti-Trump signs. “I’m like, are you serious?” she said. “The language doesn’t need to be there. My children need to drive by that.”

GIRL ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! The man you supported for the last 5 years talked about grabbing women by the pussy and using the F-Word while being the freakin' President of the USA. AND NOW YOU'RE OFFENDED? How convenient...
Grim Reaper: It's Time to Go

President Trump: Was I a good President?

Grim Reaper: No. You were fucking awful.
Reddit so broken it took me 10 minutes to get into the comments
Aw they look like they’re having so much fun celebrating in DC. Wish I could be there
Thank you you majestic people voting for President Elect Biden. Decency restored.

A Dutch friend
No more Trump, no more Pence, no more DeVos, Miller, Kushner, Trump spawns, Giuliani, and many others... what a day.
Dear MAGA asshats. My election results don’t care about your feelings.
 Overheard in the Whitehouse after PA flipped:

"He got me," Trump said of Biden's mail-in turnout over him. "That f\*\*\*king Biden boomed me."

Trump added, "He's so good," repeating it four times.

Trump then said he wanted to add Biden to the list of politicians he works out with this summer.
Guys, we’re breaking Reddit.
Holy shit, Paris rang church bells. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside how much the rest of the world had our backs on dumping Trump
*Trump wins*

Republicans: Get bent liberal turds

*Biden wins*

Republicans: This is a time for national unity.
I'm getting out the wine. 4 years of bullshit trumpism and his toxic, racist, sexist, authoritarian nonsense spilling over to the rest of the world is over.
This actually broke Reddit.

Magnificent.
You should all stop awarding this post and donate to the Georgia run offs. We need the Senate if we want real change.
Joyscrolling is soooo much better than doomscrolling.
I'm pregnant and so happy that this baby won't be born in Trump's America.
Oh, Trump 2020 was an expiration date..
As a German understanding what facists can destroy I'm glad that the citizens of America didn't need 12 years to understand it.
It doesn't seem relevant if you like Biden or not, Trump wasn't a good President. 

Congratulations! Celebrate with care and stay safe!
I did not expect the tears.  I live in Minneapolis - between the pandemic, George Floyd and the fog of hatred we have all lived under for four years, I feel this so much more than I expected.
John Lewis sends his regards.
WE CANT STOP VOTING LIKE THIS. EVERY 4 YEARS! 

Now we take back the senate with the Georgia runoffs.

I long for the day we fix this country. We are a long way off but we are finally on the right track.
The lame Donald Duck session now begins.
Do. Not. Get. Complacent.

Remember how you feel right now. Hold on to that. Stay engaged. Continue to fight for our futures.

Yes we still can...

"In case you missed it, the Trump campaign called a press conference this morning in the parking lot of "Four Seasons Total Landscaping" in Philadelphia. The assumption is that they meant to book the Four Seasons hotel but made a mistake and just went with it. Seriously."
Trump supporter: "Is this real news or fake news?"

Reporter: "Fuck off"

While I highly encourage everyone to savor this moment and let out a sigh of relief, know that this fight is not over. Georgia will be having 2 run off elections and this is incredibly important if we want to give our President a fighting chance at getting anything done in the Senate.

If you can afford it, please consider donating to either Jon Ossoff [here](https://electjon.com/), Raphael Warnock [here](https://warnockforgeorgia.com/), or the amazing Fair Fight organization headed by Stacey Abrams [here](https://fairfight.com/). 

If you didn’t register to vote in GA for the general election, you can still register to vote and vote in the runoff! Register to vote in GA [here](https://georgia.gov/register-to-vote).
> All the Biden supporters need to calm down. This election isn’t over. Just because the mainstream media projects Biden won means nothing. Let the lawsuits begin! This country is rampant with voter fraud and voter suppression. Trump will take Biden and the left down once and for all! Let’s do this! Drain the swamp and lock up these criminals!!

From a Facebook friend who’s been posting pro trump shit for the last 4+ years. The tears are delicious.
Republicans: There is voter fraud in swing states of MI, PA, WI, GA and MN

Also Republicans: There was no voter fraud in FL, NC, IA, OH, TX

Right.
Will Don retire to Russia and start Trump TV?
I love that Biden won by 'razor sharp' margins also 4.5 million votes and growing.... abolish the electoral college.
You guys, Betsy Davos is gone. We beat Umbridge.
I KNEW this shit was gonna get called while I was sleeping
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him
5 minutes before President Trumps Lawyers give their press conference in Philidelphia. LOL Beta Wannabe Dicktator must be roid raging!
No one droplet is responsible for the flood. Thank you, all who voted for flushing the turd.
Brit here — Firstly, I am so proud and happy for the great country of the United States of America. You guys wanted change, and you made it happen. Bless all of you! 

Secondly, as soon as Biden is sworn in I’m acting like this entire Trump presidency was an interactive episode of Black Mirror. I will never again acknowledge that horrendous human being. 

Seeing you all so happy, with hope for the first time in four years, is heart warming. As I said, I am not an American, but I love your country and you guys!
Hilarious how many conservatives are discussing they hope Biden is serious about uniting the country. So two-faced, now that you've lost, they expect Biden to act better than they wanted Trump to act.

Biden should, but it's still such a highlight of how pathetic and hypocritical so many conservatives are after supporting Trump's hijacking this country and decimating chances at unity, and now they want it.

Ridiculous.
Normally I think Van Jones comes off as too preachy. But I am feeling the exact same thing as he does.

So I agree 1,000,000% with him.
Trump got the full 2020 experience, got COVID and got unemployed
I can’t stop crying. I feel like I’ve finally broken free from four years of unrelenting abuse for which I never signed up. 

And I cannot understate the gravity of saying *Vice President Kamala Harris*. On the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. ETA: and the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.

Holy shit.

Fuck **YOUR** feelings.

GEORGIA!!! Job's not finished, help us take control of the senate! Make sure you vote in January!
Obama's portrait will finally be displayed in the WH, since Trump refused to. 

That will be a nice ceremony.
Why can't Trump return to the White House?

Because it's FOR BIDEN
Man, Van is really speaking the truth.  Fuck Trump and Mother fuck every person who votes for this sack of shit.

Fox News saying Biden needs to write a speech calling for unity and asking him to reach across the aisle to work with republicans is the least self aware moment of 2020.

THANK YOU BLACK VOTERS IN DETROIT, WISCONSIN AND GA! We did this!!

Sorry guys I missed a few: Philly, Pittsburgh and Navajo Nation as well. Also I will not change this post to “all votes matter rhetoric lol” because the work of Stacy Abrams and other POC/black leaders need to be recognized as crucial to this election!

Thank you for participating here, for engaging in meaningful discussions, and for voting. You make democracy successful.
First time I ever voted for a Democrat from GA. 

Can't support what the GOP was doing!
Trump removed protections from Tongass National Forest, one of the largest intact temperate rainforests, let's upvote and try to reach the New President, Joe Biden. This has to be revoked. 

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/10/28/trump-tongass-national-forest-alaska/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/10/28/trump-tongass-national-forest-alaska/)
For the people saying “if the GOP keep the Senate this doesn’t really matter, nothing will get done.” I get the sentiment. A lot of legislation will probably get stalled.

But are you forgetting all the things Biden can do with the executive branch? We can get rid of Barr and any other Trump people at the DOJ. DACA is safe. Crappy immigration policies from the last 4 years can be rolled back. Joe can once again join the Paris climate agreement. These are just off the top of my head, there are many more.

This wasn’t for nothing. We have a reason to celebrate.

Thank you California, for exporting Californians to red states (keep up the good work!).

Georgia, Arizona, and my 2nd home Pennsylvania thank you so much!!! History will remember you.

Georgia you honored John Lewis


Arizona you honored John McCain


Florida you're useless.
I just cried over the election results... Never thought I’d care this much. Amazing feeling!
I'd like to congratulate my friends in the USA on celebrating democracy today, 

and on celebrating 4 years of Mister Joe Biden.

Much of love from overseas.
Can we all somehow agree to completely ignore Donald Trump from now on? Without the attention that gives him any shred of relevance, he will crawl into a hole and shrivel up. Bye.
Instead of buying awards, send that money to Stacey Abrams group in Georgia and get President-Elect Biden some help!

https://fairfight.com/
I'm a 50 year old man and I'm not ashamed to say I cried when I heard the news.  It felt like a weight had been lifted off my back.  I'm just sick of hearing about Trump 24/7 for the last 4 yerars.   I didn't even consider myself a Democrat until Trump was elected.  I'd voted 3rd party for the previous two elections and a mix of Democrat and Republican candidates before those.   After the way the Republican party bowed to Trump, I'll never vote for a Republican again.   Now I'm going to donate to the Democratic Georgia Senate candidates.
So, some of you think that Democrats stole the election for Biden...but left McConnell and Graham in power? Are you okay?
Lol at CNN trying to give Melania the benefit of the doubt... she's a giant turd too.  Fuck outta here with that
Cindy McCain: Tell Trump. I want him to know it was me.
A Dem inherits a country in flames, I think there may be a pattern with this.
“I just got off the phone with former Vice President Biden to congratulate him on his historic win. I have instructed my staff to work with the Biden team to ensure a peaceful transition of power. I want to thank all of my supporters who came out in record numbers but unfortunately it was not quite enough to secure a victory. Most of all, I would like to thank my adoring wife Melania who has been my rock during this stressful election. Thank you all. Stay tuned for more to come! God bless our troops and god bless the United States of America!”

[President Trump’s statement](https://i.gifer.com/IJa.gif)
Philadelphia:  When you made the Super Bowl and they had to grease all the poles in the city because they knew that, win or lose, you'd become extremely inebriated and climb them all while shouting obscenities; You had my respect.

You then did the impossible and your long and girthy penised Quarterback led you to victory over the evil Patriots.  When in your overwhelming joy you partied all night in the streets lighting fireworks and consuming the feces of horses; You had my respect.  

Now you've almost single handedly carried your state by voting in record numbers to banish the orange sociopath from office.  You've said "Iggles fan Joe Biden is our man".  The man from Scranton who sometimes called himself your third senator.  The man who's been everywhere from Claymont, to Wilmington, to New-Ark, and nearly as far south as Ocean City.  The man with a beach house in Rehoboth.  The man who rides the Amtrak eatin' a hoagie.  The next President of the United States.   Philadelphia; You'll always have the respect of this New Yorker.

Wourder Ice on me.
To the over 74 million people who voted along with me.  Thank you.

Sorry to anyone taking AP History in 30 years!
Thank you to everyone who volunteered, donated, organized, and a big shout out to all of you voting for the first time this year. Without all of you, this wouldn’t have happened. 

Please remember that justice and democracy are journeys, not destinations, and that we must forever be vigilant in protecting the lives and liberty of all our fellow humans. The 21st century is a fight for our continued existence, and the only way we win is by coming together as a species. This will not happen overnight, and some days will go better than others, but take care of yourself, and let’s build a world our children and grandchildren will be proud of.
Talk about a close shave, thank you to everyone who voted out our soon to be ex president, may he enjoy many decades in prison

This is an amazing day. The wait was worth the payoff.
Get fucked nazis.
I CANNOT BELIEVE MY FUCKING STATE PULLED THROUGH AND FLIPPED BLUE!! FUCK TRUMP FUCK TRUMP FUCK TRUMP! Winning never felt so good
Fox is now explaining Biden's stuttering and saying he isn't senile. They are commending his campaign and leadership. I feel like I'm living in an upside down world.

I voted for Trump in 2016. I am crying tears of joy for Biden’s victory. Trump has conned us all. He has cost us American lives. Joe Biden will restore our global reputation. Joe Biden will stop the spread of COVID. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will get us on track towards racial equality. I am thankful today.
Oh Van Jones, I’m crying with you bro.
I can breathe.   America can breathe.
ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, AP, New York Times, and Washington Post call it for Biden . 

Fox News crickets
Celebrate responsibly. We're now close to  losing 1000+ Americans a day to Covid-19.
My Trump supporter friends are refusing to accept this loss.  Fucking hilarious.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the man. 

He’s elected to the senate in 1979. When shortly after, his wife and child are killed. Leaving him with 2 sons without a mom. 

He decided he is going to give it up to raise his kids, only to be encouraged to at least give the senate try. 

So his sister moves in with him and helps raise his kids. As he commutes from Delaware to DC in a train to be a dad and Senator. 

He then goes on to serve 30 years in the senate.  

Then 8 years as Vice President, under our first African American president.  He was also the first major politician to speak out for gay marriage (he said it before Obama). 

Keep in mind, VP is a largely thankless job and is essentially a resume builder to be president. 

But then in 2016. He didn’t run.  He left the gate open for our first woman president. 

Then, he has a child die of brain cancer. 

Joe Biden, who could retire and forever be already known as a great American, decides to run for president as a unifier during one of the most divided times in American politics. in addition,he adds the first woman of color on a major party ticket. 

At 78 years old, his name and his family was dragged through the mud. 

But he won. America won. 

Congrats, President Biden.
We just gave Trump the full 2020 experience! He contracted COVID, and now he’s unemployed!
This thread is going so fast no one will know I’m gay for democracy and have a raging hard on for universal enfranchisement.

Edit - there goes my award virginity! USA USA USA!!!
Conservatives online are laughing about how calm they are, how they won’t protest, how life will just go on normally for them, unlike the left in 2016. 

It’s almost like the next administration doesn’t existentially threaten them or the people they love. It’s easy to be calm when you aren’t under the threat of a populist who campaigned on unconstitutional prejudice towards minorities, abandoning allies, and taking away access to healthcare.

I’m genuinely glad for them. America is better when it’s not led by a vindictive, selfish, egomaniacal asshole.
This is the first time an incumbent president has lost in a lot of people's lives. This is unpresidented.

Even for older millennials, they were kids and probably don't remember George H.W. losing to Clinton, even though they were alive for it.
Holy fuck. 2 mins and already 1300 well wishers telling Donald to get fucked.

My heart is aglow.
This man breaking down on CNN is speaking to my soul. How long has he had to hold that in?

For us Canadians, making fun of the United States is basically our nationally pastime, but really, you are our allies, our neighbours, and our friends. That is why the past four years have been so painful for us (although I am sure they have been even worse for you); we have seen a close friend go mad and turn on us. All I can say today is this: welcome back, USA.

I hope that Carter, Clinton, Bush and Obama all write letters for Biden because you know that Trump won’t. 

I don’t think Trump will show for Biden’s inauguration either.

Deutsche Bank : So, about those personally guaranteed loans, Mr. Trump?
I'm gonna admit, when I saw Van Jones on CNN and he started crying, I started crying with him. I watched his outrage 4 years ago, and am glad I was able to see him finally come out the other side of it.
you can thank a lot of people for this, but i will NEVER forget what Stacey Abrams, and, in turn, Atlanta black women did for us this year

I was so pumped up with Biden winning that I was given a burst of confidence and asked out my crush on a date. She said YES
I tried to post this in the conservative thread as I'd like to open up a real dialogue, but it's flaired users only there. So I guess I'll post it here:


As a former Republican from Texas, can I please say:

They don't want your guns. Obama was born in America. There were no emails for crooked Hillary, nor were there Mexican gangs roaming the suburbs. There was no Antifa attack. There is no laptop. And there is no voter fraud. 

How many times can someone cry wolf here? They pulled these tactics when I was voting for Bush and it never led anywhere.

There was, however, an investigation that led to multiple Presidential staffers and campaign managers being given prison time for their involvement in the 2016 campaign. 

Why don't Republicans care about this?

The only thing the last administration did was give massive tax cuts to corporations, sever our control on a global scale, and undermined our democracy.

This is not the Republican party I grew up with. This has been a sham and a tarnish on what used to be a party that stood on Christian morals and values. The party has thrown their character to the wind.

The Republican party lost its way when it embraced the misguided lies and got away from policy. I haven't voted Republican in years, but the party has only sank further and further from what it used to be.

I actually hope you guys get it together, as diverse opinions are the embodiment of democracy. I know this will be deleted but I had to get it off my chest. 

I really want us to work together again.

If anyone out there is confused or annoyed by the amount of liberal joy that's on display in this thread and around the country, I'll explain it to you. It's not just that we won, it's that WE ARE THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA and we won. It's been a tough 4 years watching a petulant man child con artist act like every single selfish act as president was somehow backed up by the the will of the people. It never was, and that's why this feels so damn good. We actually managed to come together after a year of infighting over which direction the party should go, and we once again became THE MAJORITY. Our voices became one, and no amount of tipping the scales was going to silence us. What we've said as a group will echo into the ages: FUCK YOU, DONALD TRUMP!
[deleted]
The real winner here is Major. That dog went from being in a shelter to moving into the White House.
Donald Trump, you’re fucking fired
Donny ONE TERM. Fuck your feelings, Trump supporters.
A few things -

1. Biden won with maybe 4 - 5 million difference in popular vote and the electoral college. So ..no ambiguity there.
2. Even though it was clear, close to 70 million voted for the orange. After 4 years of nonsense, that is 70 million more than it should have been.
3. 4 years of racist, brain addled nonsense is finally over. Everyday I woke up to a very confusing world where I could not believe what was happening.
4. Finally, the democrats have to find a way of reaching out to the middle "red" america. Why is it that despite the incompetence at the top, those ppl did not abandon the red party?
Hey sex is cool but have you ever voted out a fascist Republican president?
I just heard a dutch tv reporter say this about trump. 'It's like they are just turning on VAR while the opponent is already holding the CL trophy.' 

As a football fan thats just a hilariously fitting analogy
Bye Don. Fucking finally!
Today may just go down in history as the day our democracy was saved from going full on fascist. Still lots of work to be done, and things won't be perfect, but at least we still have our democracy and not even they could take that way from us.
The McCains and Lewis’s send their regards

We shouldn't get complacent just yet. It's President-elect now and I won't be happy until I see the cheeto is gone on Jan 20th. 

Trump isn't going to just accept this, and he's going to try and hold on for as long and as hard as he can, til the very last minute. He's going to fight in the courts, and when that doesn't work, he's going to incite his cult.

Donald Trump is incredibly dangerous now that he's a trapped animal.
So proud of all my fellow Americans!

Congrats to PRESIDENT ELECT JOE BIDEN!!!

I’m definitely not the first to say this but, my god am I happy for you guys. This last week I’ve barely been keeping it together. Even though it was a foregone conclusion for the last two days, I haven’t been able to tear myself from any network I can get my hands on. The fact that it was in question hurt. I have welled up multiple times since the news broke. 

Every video of people dancing in the streets reminds me of the end of WW2 and if I could I would be right there with you. Congrats from Sk, Canada

ETA: I asked for Nov 4th off work months ago, once it became clear results would take awhile because of mail in, my boss gave me the rest of the week off. She’s the best
If you're in Georgia, you can still register to vote in the runoff elections for Senate. The deadline is December 7th. People tend to neglect legislature elections and put all their focus on the presidency - the legislature is arguably more important. You will need to request another absentee ballot by that deadline to vote by mail. 
Republicans have been shown to be a minority in Georgia. Use that. I'm not Ossoff or Warnock's hugest fan, but they're better than the alternatives.
Register. Vote. Reach out to me if you need help with either.
Y’all do realize we just gave 3.9k awards to a bot
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me. You let me make a difference. A place where even orphaned immigrants can leave their fingerprints and rise up!
I just heard Christie talking about how Joe Biden needed to take into account the 70 million who voted for trump. How it’s important for democrats to think about the people who voted against them. Why is it that when Democrats win they need to take into account republicans? Do Republicans EVER, take into account democratic voters? Did Trump take into account at any point the majority of Americans who voted against him? I know that they have no shame and hypocrisy means nothing but JTFC they are the worst.

Edit: typos.
Even Reddit servers are celebrating Biden's win. They're out lol.
Congrats USA - much love from 🇬🇧 

So happy and proud that democracy and decency won out. World needs saving, and making a better place and this is where we can carry on.

As sweet as it is knowing Trump cost them the Senate, the realization that McConnell is no longer in control of the senate is even sweeter.
I love how the people over at r/conservative are sifting through the ashes this morning trying to figure out how this happened.

How did sleepy joe biden and the “incompetent do nothing Democrats” completely destroy them and how they’ve managed to take the house, senate, and White House is quite a mystery.

I hope the mirror is still in tact when they come across it. It wasn’t just Trump’s insanity, or Mitch and the 2000 checks, or the insanity of the GOP... it was the casual conservative member allowing themselves to be seduced by false prophets. It was the collective disgust of everyone around these conservatives that has propelled the success of Stacey Abrams and the New Democratic Party. 

So, thanks for your help on this guys!
So... Minority Mitch?
Now keep it up, Democrats. Don't stop showing up in 2022 and fall into the trap that you did in 2010. Vote like your life depends on it because it does.
The 2021 headline we needed to see.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The end of an error.
Remember when Mitch laughed about COVID during his debate with Amy McGrath?

Yeah. 

Who's laughing now, you sonofabitch. 

Time to get some good work done, for good people, for the good of all. And time for you to fuck off.

Edit: thank you couldn't remember what he was laughing about

Edit 2: This comment sure sounds trite compared to the attack on the capitol. Horrifying.
God. I haven’t felt this good since like, 2008.
Elections have consequences. 


Get. Fucked.
Fuck Mitch McConnell
Somebody post that crab rave. I love that shit
Well... bye. 

Fucker
What we saw in Georgia speaks in volumes to the magnitude of voter suppression in the south. Stacey Abrams and her team really underscored the possibility that Georgia may never have even truly been red  just suppressed.
Right now I'm trying to think about why he would turn down the 2k stimulus check while the Georgia race was over. He HAD to have know turning it down would make Republicans look worse and affect the outcome in Georgia and then lose his own position of power in the process. What was so bad about the alternative that he chose to shoot himself in the foot like this? There has to be some behind the scenes shit going on that we don't know about.
The day we saw that nasty smirk wiped off his drooping face. What a great day.

Christmas came and went and came early again it seems. It’s snowing outside my place and I am just cherishing this present - free from McConnell.

r/badturtlenolettuce
I can think of 2000 reasons why this happened, Mitch. And you and your cluster of rich but mentally broken old coots like you that give you your marching orders have no one to blame but yourselves. Experience is a harsh teacher, even for old fossils like you Mitch. And hubris is the harshest of teaching tools.
What makes it all the sweeter is that he is legitimately a cunning and strong senate leader at completing his agenda and completely obstructing the other sides’ while somehow not being labeling and monster and hypocrite by the right. This political genius lost his majority because he refused to give people money during the pandemic because they’re trying to get back to being deficit hawks.

a political miscalculation that everyone saw coming caused his loss and I couldn’t be happier
[removed]
I detest him, too. But right now, all I feel is an overwhelming sense of gratitude. The voters of the United States rejected Donald Trump, and stopped, at least for a time, the slide into autocracy and fascism that he so eagerly was pushing. 

And the people of Georgia, formerly a red state, turned purple just in time to give our new president a slim majority in both Houses. We may be able to get the much needed progressive changes we need, and create jobs that will last well into the future. 

Thank you, Georgia.
This importance of the second stimulus can't be undervalued.  If Mitch and Trump got together and gave everyone $2k...or even the $600 BEFORE the election sometime in Sept or October PA and GA likely wouldn't have flipped.  These states need the money and it's clear that some Republican voters stayed home.  Their greed got them in this mess.
Police pulled McConnell over when they heard he was a minority leader.
I am honestly so impressed, I thought that never in a million years would the Dems win either race. Now Biden actually has a chance to get some things done.
[removed]
As a Georgia voter, you are welcome. I'm saving this thread for posterity.
The Democrats should just go hog fucking wild. Offer Manchin something super cozy in exchange for his seat, I don't care. They have two years to offer an extremely stark contrast against Trump's presidency. If they get a lot of meaningful change done, the vacuum left in Trump's absence might actually persuade some of his supporters to realize "oh wow, I really was conned, my life really *is* significantly better under Democratic leadership." I can only think that's the case because Trump had a ton of support from non-voters who aren't necessarily Republicans. So they won't default to automatically voting for Republican in 2022 or 2024.

The things that the Democrats offer have to really be meaningful for the working class, though. If poor Mississippians finally feel like their lives are improving, they can be won over. If the focus is only on things that appeal mainly to big-city voters, the Republicans will win big again. It's not that I don't support things like trans protections, for example, and I think meaningful positive change is needed there, but I hope that at some point, there's a realization that so many of Trump's voters weren't conservative or Republican, they were desperate and struggling lower-class workers who have felt abandoned. Some of them have never met a trans person in their life. That's not to dismiss the fight for trans rights by any means, but those Trump voters *can* be won over, despite what it may seem, by having someone fight for their economic interests and give them a leg up. Now is the time to just fucking go for it and try to win back some of the voters that Trump really let down.
Donald Trump’s transformation of the Republican Party:

2017: Trump and Pence take office.

2018: Republicans lose the House.

2020: Republicans lose the presidency.

2021: Republicans lose the Senate.

I love it when a plan comes together.

Move Mitch, get out the way

Get out the way Mitch, get out the way
Mitch seemed to forget that while the mega rich might make up the majority of the wealth, they certainly don’t make up the majority of the vote. Bye fucker. Signed, a blue Kentuckian.
So long, McTurdle.
Honestly, the first time I’ve seen a completely rational, fully formed thought over in r/conservative:

>”Google Trend stats say it all: last week Georgians searched for 3 things: stimulus, unemployment, and coronavirus. McConnell and the GOP corporate cronies in the Senate failed to deliver on what voters care about and got punished. The GOP eighter becomes a conservative multi-ethnic working-class party or it dies. Good riddance.”

I’ve literally never seen someone over there see what happened, correctly pinpoint their party’s issue, and reject the GOP for what it is. Bravo to that guy.
Can we say we’ve passed the turtle hurdle?
Fuck Mitch! This is the best news ever!
Music to my fucking ears

Fuck you mitch McConnell
Now the real fight and real danger for 2022 begins. 

The democratic caucus in both houses must move swiftly and decisively  with extremely carefully crafted legislation  to survive inevitable Supreme Court challenges with a Mitch McConnell hand picked court. 

The goal now of the Republicans will be to poison the well at every step to be able to roll into 2022 with "look the democrats lied" as their rallying cry. 


The democrats MUST deliver on the campaign promises of the last 2 years in spite of the courts or all of this work will be washed away in qanon dipshits being elected in 2022.

Worth the $1400
Congratz from across the pond! Perhaps now, Americans can start getting some human rights befitting a first world country?
I'm guessing Mcconnell is hated by both sides. Couldn't happen to a worse guy
Mitch who?
My husband woke me up at 6:30 this morning to tell me the news. We're Canadian and yet I am still so happy. Congratulations, America!
SENATE *MINORITY* LEADER MITCH McCONNELL.
Imagine being so evil that you would rather lose your majority power instead of just giving american 2000 dollars
Let's celebrate this today and then hold Dems feet to the fire moving forward.
Mitch please!


        Get fucked.
Dems have sooo much work ahead from fixing all the failed check and balance, election security that GOP exploited massively while blaming the other camp, judges, the whole administrive branches filled with loyalist and unqualified people, etc.... etc... etc...

I think Dems should focus big time on pandemic and fixing things for the first 2 years.  That's all.  And they also need to UP their ground game.  Good damn... after all this, they barly won.
Also how soon till McConnell complains about lack of bipartisanship?
a hearty FU to Kentucky. You 47th in everything ass punks aren't in charge anymore.
As a resident of Georgia I woke up this morning with a proud feeling towards my state and what collectively our votes did. It isn’t just about getting McConnell out of his position. It’s also showing that Georgia refuses to be seen as a Republican state with citizens that can be taken advantage of or ignored. 

If you don’t want to represent the people in our state, we will make sure that you do not represent the people in our state.
Best possible outcome.
Anyone know if Trump now is the biggest loser in Presidential history? Is he the first President losing Congress, losing Senate, and losing the second term race?

Take the L
The will of the people
Don't underestimate the impact of this. While refusing to bring forth a vote for the Supreme Court in Obama's last term was his most disgraceful act, it is far from the only one that had an enormous impact.

He can no longer refuse to bring legislation to a vote, which not only blocked legislative, but shielded Senators in States were elections would be close from accountability for their vote.

They have far less ability to railroad investigations by Senate committees. This will make it much harder to shield not only Trump, but other Republican politicians from the legal consequences of their actions during the 2016 elections and Trump's Presidency.

Making him a minority leader, instead of a Majority leader is of dramatic significance.
This is even bigger and better news than Biden winning.

I truly believe that this man is the root of all evil in the US.


Disclaimer: Am not a US citizen.
Someone get mitch some strawberries and lettuce, I’m sure the little guy is having a bad day.
Hey Mitch, when you’re done fucking your sister, go fuck yourself!
I’m really not a hateful person, but I hate Mitch McConnell. He’s blocked progress in this country for far, far too long. I’m celebrating today
Best. Day. Ever.
Great! Now impeach Kavanaugh and Barrett on established precedent, and reconfirm Merrick Garland. 

Abolish citizens United, make election day a federal holiday, institute national vote by mail, and make gerrymandering illegal with very strong sentences.

Create a federal coronavirus response, mandatory nationwide shutdown with monthly $2-$5,000 checks for three months. 

Medicare for all.

We have 2 years minimum to get Americans what they really need.
ya'll remember when after biden won, the idiots at r/conservative were all like

"it doesn't really matter, we still have control of the senate, so the dems won't accomplish anything lol"

i remember that.
Everybody tip their cap to Mr. Trump. We couldn’t have done it without him. He finally did something useful.
So Democrats have the House, Senate, and Presidency?!

Edit: Thank you for the award!
Stop, please, I can only get so erect
[Me observing Perdue and Loeffler leaving congress](https://i.gifer.com/1Hic.gif)

[Me observing Ossoff and Warnock entering congress](https://i.gifer.com/1Hic.gif)
Reading r/conservative right now is some of the best comedy I’ve read in years. Highly recommend.
Time to resign Mitch.
As a conservative, I am very, very happy with the results. I can't even consider myself an R anymore with how the party has treated COVID and the stimulus. 

I am happy to see that our government will actually have a chance to do some work and get things accomplished. I won't be happy with everything, but I will be happy with most. 

Hats off to the Georgian votes, and black voters. They really did bring it home for the Ds.
(EDIT): Well it didn't take long for thoughts of a remote sense of civility and hope in the Capitol were dashed. I fucking live here in DC. I'm on U. St., so at least I was far away and working from home but Jesus Christ and all his little carpenter friends... We need to focus funding on education and not the absurd amount we procure for defense spending. We need to educate these fuck-gloves or we're going to see this nonce-sense again and again. I'm a Private Military Consultant focusing in Foreign Military Sales; currently for the Army, but past clients have been the Navy and DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency) - I'm disgusted and disappointed. I wanted to be a patriot and serve in the military but was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and thusly turned away - so I settled for a civilian avenue of serving this shit-wagon for the last ten years. Again, I'm so tired, and no matter how many anecdotes read in the house tonight from greater men and women stemming from a harsher or more decadent years - I saw domestic terrorism, and the hope I had this morning was clearly naïve. Fuck it and fuck you.

Guys, despite my name username, I've had very little hope for much and for so long. Today really is something to be thankful for and I'm actually hopeful for a possible change. I'm definitely keeping my expectations low because my cynical presumptions are so strong. I'm so tired. Fuck you turtle-man.
Here’s hoping his body disintegrates within the next two years
This is the best day of 2021!  


The best day of 2021 ***so far!***  


Thanks, Georgia!!
Womp womp

Now maybe we'll actually get some shit voted on instead of bills just dying on that graveyard he calls a desk.
Get bent, Mitch. My the future be as harsh to you as you have been to us.
What a wonderful day for America in all regards.
And watch... Nobody is going to try to take anyone's fucking guns. It's fear-mongering bullshit.
DO NOT FORGET THIS AND BECOME COMPLACENT AGAIN. Y’all, we gotta stay engaged and enraged and not just scramble when our country is on fire. We have to do better.
I fucking hope the democrats are ruthlessly progressive. None of this timid appeal to both sides horse shit. Fucking stand for something. Fucking put forward a progressive idea for a prosperous future rather than relying on running as "not a republican" to get elected 

Don't fucking waste this. Fuck.
Conservative/libertarian here. Thank you Dems for finally wresting control of our country away from these traitors.
To MY AMERICAN FRIENDS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GEORGIA

&#x200B;

You are all welcome :) --- Even though damn near half of the state voted for the nutjobs of Loeffler and Perdue
Thank you Georgia for saving the Union from Kentucky.
Move Mitch, get out the way!
McConnel has become one of the things he swore to destroy.

A minority.
I'm not even an American but this made my day. Feels like it is Christmas! Thank you Georgia!
Georgia is literal MVP this election cycle
I'm glad Rush Limbaugh was alive to see this.

> To put this in context, the last time a President was impeached Donald J Trump only had 8 bankruptcies and was on his 2nd marriage. He now has 11 bankruptcies, 3 marriages, 3,500 legal cases, and has officially been impeached.
My representative, Dean Phillips, is the first Democrat in MN-3 since 1961. He just voted to impeach.

Don’t tell me voting doesn’t matter.
Wait, Donald Trump from “The Apprentice”??
Let's all remember:

**I'm not so sure he ever wanted to be President.** He looked like his [dog died](http://i.imgur.com/7WB763p.jpg) on election day. (Except you'll have to picture someone who likes dogs) Melania [broke down in tears](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html?gtm=bottom). (reportedly not good ones, although she denied it)

Cohen testified before Congress and said [he never wanted to win](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431802-cohen-trump-described-his-campaign-as-the-greatest-infomercial-in-political) - that he saw the primaries and election as a marketing strategy for him.

>"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great," Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. "He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself and to build his wealth and power."

>"Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history," Cohen said in his opening remarks. "He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity."

[Trump Tower Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow) is another curious element. It was a project that Trump, Cohen, and Giuliani consistently lied about, and that Cohen was even charged over. Despite conflicts of interest and political ramifications (something a potential candidate would be very wary of pursuing), the project was pursued up until June, 2016. Talks dissolved as the election neared and Trump's political chances and exposure grew.

It doesn't seem too far-fetched to suggest that ever since election night, we've been witnessing what a narcissistic reality TV show host and casino owner (with ZERO political experience) would do if they **accidentally won the presidency.** 

Painfully enough, we're also seeing what the GOP and 40% of the nation would do in this scenario straight out of TheOnion.

Ironically, he now has incentive to stay President because it is the only thing shielding him from indictments. Cohen is literally in prison for crimes Trump directed, evidenced in no uncertain terms by SDNY as "Individual-1". There are at least 4 open-and-shut OOJ charges that would result in indictments, [according to 1,000 federal prosecutors.](https://www.newsweek.com/former-federal-prosecutors-trump-indicted-wasnt-president-1439716) The Ukraine saga that has led to his impeachment could very well be explained partly because he will do anything to stay out of prison (AKA - winning 2020).

We haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of his financial crimes, despite knowing him and his family [defrauded the government of $400 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) for decades. He also [lost more than a billion dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=27AE398E38DC3D72B25FC7C9355C6E51&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL) in the 80's and 90's.

Just think about it: He promised to release his tax returns in the campaign, only to do a 180 and *appeal three separate cases all the way to the Supreme Court*. This is not a man who ever wanted the microscope and scrutiny of becoming President.

It's insane to think that 40% of the nation and the GOP have a cult-like following around a person who honestly might be trapped and desperately never wanted to be where he is. Luckily for him, he's a self-obsessed businessman devoid of empathy or integrity who has been bullshitting people his entire life. Otherwise, he might not be able to keep this charade up.

When all the dust settles, future historians are going to have a hell of a time writing about this period. I can picture them now - combing through tweets and absurd public statements. I feel like any teachers trying to cover this time are going to have to constantly remind students "Yes, I promise this really happened."
Wow...I've been alive to see 2 US Presidents impeached...
Huh.  That caller from Alabama was right.  They *did* impeach the fucker, and I *am* having a great day.
No matter what happens in the Senate, Donald J. Trump will forever carry the mark of impeachment on his presidential record and in the history books.
[Jonathan Allen](https://twitter.com/jonallendc/status/1207489389535866881?s=20)

>Unprecedented: Trump now holds the record for most votes ever acquired on an article of impeachment at 230. He's also No. 2 at 229.

Pull out the impeachment map!
Pelosi just hinted they'll never send the articles unless McConnell agrees to a fair trial process. 

That means there's a possibility Trump is forever impeached, never acquitted. 

Hard. Ball.
Forever and ever on wikipedia


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidential_impeachments
I like presidents who weren't impeached.
The impeached President of the United States just mocked a congresswoman mourning the death of her husband who was a long time congressman by saying that he was probably in hell right now. This is our timeline.
This was the right way to proceed and was required to show that our country did not stand with the current administration. The Senate may not remove the president which is frustrating, but it is written in history that there is a significant resistance to his abuse that believes in the ideals in which our country was created.
Trump is so angry. He needs to calm down and maybe just go see a movie with his friends or something.

*Edit* Thank you for the Silver and I am grateful. Please get out to vote in 2020 and beyond everyone!

Blue Wave 2018 sends its regards. Let's keep fucking voting!
I hope the GOP wears this as a stain for generations to come.
VOTE IN 2020

Team Trump now has ~1 year to spin this impeachment into a full-on coup narrative. Don't underestimate how many people out there are sitting in front of their t.v.'s believing they just witnessed an attempted assassination of their glorious king. The radical Republican base is going to be fiercer than ever. Democrats NEED a strong, solitary representative.

EDIT: You can check to see if you're registered to vote [here!](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) I just double-checked I'm registered as a Democrat now so I can vote in the primaries.
Hi, mom. We successfully impeached the president you voted for. Looking forward to avoiding political discourse on Christmas.
First president impeached during his first term!
This isn't the end. Please Register to vote for 2020. Check your status on your state's registration website and make sure you are registered and it's active. They can and will purge you into inactive and you will not be able to vote when you get to the polls.

Find the dates of the booths and locations to vote and be sure to schedule time off from work even if just a couple of hours. Get your friends to register and make sure they have the time and transportation to get there. If we don't win in the senate, we will win in the polls.

Vote Him Out.

EDIT: Thanks for the medals!

Updated list of impeached U.S. presidents:

1. Andrew Johnson  
2. Bill Clinton  
3. Donald Trump
Wow, and there it is! Thanks for voting in 2018 folks
They impeached the motherfucker
Awwww shit, thanks again 2018 voters. Let's get this work for 2020.
Andrew Johnson: Impeached for firing a Cabinet member

Bill Clinton: Impeached for getting dome

Donald Trump: Impeached for trying to subvert our foreign policy for his own personal gain, blackmailing an ally, trying to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections and breaking the law by refusing to comply and theying to hinder with a Congressional investigation
Donald Trump is an impeached President, and always will be. Love it. 

Fuck Donald Trump.
Ha, CNN made a point that made me happy, 100 years from now, in history people may not know anything about what random ass President of the US was in early 2000s. The only thing people will remember is he was impeached. That is his legacy. Thats the correct one.
Second article just passed

https://i.imgur.com/ZJCG6Kp.jpg
I'm getting tired of the number of people both conservative and liberal wondering the point behind this impeachment if the Senate will just acquit the President.

The Constitution is just a collection of **ideas** written on a document. If we stop defending and upholding these ideas on this document, they become completely meaningless. It is the House's Constitutional duty to impeach the President as per Article 2 Section 4. Imagine the alternative, if the House did not assert itself and simply allowed the Executive to do what it wants without repercussion. It would set a terrible precedent which would set another precedent until we completely do away with our American experiment.

Events like this, **even if only symbolic, are important**. The moment we stop defending our Constitution and our American institutions and the American ideals they should uphold is the moment we lose our country to a dictator or chaos.
Thank you to whomever voted in the last election. Without you, this wouldn’t have happened. Regardless of what happens next, it’s important to stand up and say this isn’t right. So thanks again.
Do your job, senators.
For once in his life, Donald Trump has got something he earned
Disgraceful show by the Republicans throughout, I hope your constituents get rid of you.
It seemed like fucking time itself stopped for the Clinton impeachment. I didn't hear a goddamn word from anyone today about this. In 3 years Trump has completely voided the significance of any checks on presidential power, not with elaborate tactics, but by stumbling through them like a blindfolded toddler.
VOTING MATTERS.

These last few months have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this impeachment would never have happened if voters hadn’t come out in such great numbers in 2018. 

So do it again, do it better, stay informed and stay on fire for truth and justice, check your registrations, get your friends and neighbors and coworkers and exes and strangers on the street to go with you en masse and VOTE in 2020 in such high numbers that attempts to steal the election or interfere with the outcome fail. Change is still possible and this nation can recover, but it won’t without you.
Stop worrying about whether or not the Senate will convict. Note how terrified they are of a long trial with lots of witnesses. They've given up on the White House and are trying to cling to the Senate. If the Dems call witnesses and drag this out, we have a better chance of flipping the Senate. Focus.
In the next few hours as everyone goes to bed, this thread is going to be brigaded by accounts posing as confused or despairing Democrats who just can't figure out why our leaders would do this and hand Trump the election in 2020.

***Don't fall for it.***

Almost no one who has actually followed the Trump presidency and understands what the point of impeachment really is will be all that discouraged by the inevitability that this gets squashed in the Senate. He was never going to be removed by this Senate and anyone who is informed and honest with themselves has known it from the start.

Those informed, honest people are the ones you should be believing right now, and they won't be in here making defeatist statements or bemoaning what a waste of time this process has been.

Impeachment was not only warranted, but imperative given the facts, and Dems in the House have done their part. The rest is up to us, the electorate, and we are not nearly so discouraged as the brigades want you to believe.

2020 matters so much. It always has, and it still does, perhaps now more than ever. Don't despair, and don't listen to those who will pretend to be in despair over impeachment. There's a fight yet to be won if honest, intelligent people will stay the course.
How about that, he finally won the popular vote.
Fuck you Donald. May this haunt your miserable life til the end of your days.
President tried to cheat an election and almost 200 republican representatives support this behavior. Remember to vote people
Damn, it's always a weird feeling seeing history happen right in front of you. Like, this shit is gonna be talked about forever, and it just happened 30 mins ago. Life's a bit like a dream.

Not a single republican vote. Party over country. Shameful.
People should be spending their money on GOP opponents in the Senate rather than buying gold for this thread.
For once in his life, Donald Trump has earned something completely through his own efforts
This is a huge moment for democracy. Not only are we holding the president accountable for his actions when they are against the law, we are taking note of people who have placed party over country. These people cannot be voted into office ever again. They have betrayed the people.
I posted this as I watched it live in the Live Thread. In case anyone wasn’t able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. 


Adam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:

Rep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   “History will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.”

Adam Schiff, (D) California;   **”Madam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.”**

Schiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.

**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. 

At that time I wasn’t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:

*A fellow Redditer sent me a message just now, informing me they registered to vote, from the link I attached above.

Great feeling being able to canvass from my couch😁

Not one Republican with a spine.
If republicans believe that the president cannot be impeached for jeopardizing national security to extort a foreign power into attacking innocent American citizens, then republicans believe a president cannot be impeached.

Every republican today should be ashamed. Every one of your representatives is defending and supporting a traitor. Nobody is forcing you to protect these crooked politicians who have harmed the United States.
Eight hours of debate.

Two articles of impeachment adopted.

Now it's Miller Time.
I want to be proud of America but I am just left with disappointment in the Republicans.
It’s about accountability. If this doesn’t pass the senate, that’s ok. At least the Dems finally showed some backbone.
 

Because it bears repeating...

Reminder: The reason these hearings are able to happen *at all* is because Democrats won in 2018.

*This* is why voting matters.

The 2018 midterms saw the highest voter turnout for a midterm election in over 50 years. In some districts turnout was as high as 60%, and some districts had higher turnout than during the last presidential election. [**1**](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665197690/a-boatload-of-ballots-midterm-voter-turnout-hit-50-year-high)

Democrats gained 40 seats in the House of Representatives. [**2**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html)

Democrats also picked up seven governorships in 2018, and two more in 2019, in [Kentucky](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581) and [Louisiana](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/louisiana-gov-john-bel-edwards-wins-re-election-blow-trump-n1084236).

Democrats picked up more than 300 seats in state legislatures, and over half of the Attorney General's seats in states across the country. In the states where Democrats did not get outright control of the state legislature, they were able to, in most cases, break Republican super-majorities.

Again, voting matters.

If voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Arizona wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent mail-in ballot counting in a very tight Senate race. [**5**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-gop-sues-limit-mail-ballots-senate-race-n933866)

If voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Florida wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent a recount in a very close governor and Senate race. [**6**](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/415852-scott-sues-broward-supervisor-of-elections-as-florida-senate-race-spirals)

In Georgia, voters actually had to file a lawsuit in order to get Brian Kemp to resign as Secretary of State, so he would not be overseeing voting counts and recounts in that state. Which is something he should have done over a month ago anyway in order to avoid conflicts of interest. [**7**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/voters-file-lawsuit-to-stop-georgia-gov-candidate-kemp-from-overseeing-election.html)

If voting didn't matter, Georgia and Wisconsin wouldn't be attempting to purge 309,000 and 234,000 voters, respectively, from the rolls in their states. [**8**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/17/georgia-purged-voters-its-rolls-its-second-state-make-cuts-less-than-week/)

Trump said at his rally that John Dingle (deceased husband and congressman of congresswoman Debbie Dingle) would be 'looking up' at her in response to her vote.

What a scumbag.
I like presidents who weren’t impeached.
I am here to witness history.
Get a conviction

Don't get a conviction. 

I voted for oversight, Pelosi pissed me off for a while after the Mueller report. But I got oversight today. So thank you.
Posting in an historic thread. Fuck Trump
In the UK it is past midnight and I have stayed up all night to see the result of this even though I have classes tomorrow,
Glad to see the orange douche finally be impeached
My cake day will forever be Trump impeachment day. I also voted Dem in 2018, you’re welcome everyone.
Voted in my first election in 2018, glad to see it had an impact 🌊
Even if impeachment was a bad move politically for dems, which it's not, it is the right thing to do for the integrity of our Republic. The Roman Republic fell because the senate failed to keep the consul's power in check over many decades.
For the first the time in Las Vegas Golden Knights history, the president of the United States has been impeached. HISTORIC!
[vote.org](Https://vote.org)

Register now, don’t let this die
Trump has 2 more impeachments than Obama will ever get. 

Suck on that Libs! 2 is better than 0.
Whether he is removed from office or not, at lease house democrats can say they did their job.
It speaks volumes the level of pro right wing propaganda on the mainstream media when one side can act like a complete anti democratic lying fool and don't lose support while the opposition has to be strategic so they don't lose support.

Edit: I've been thinking about it and what's sadder is that this statement was probably interpreted by people from both side of the isle as completely applicable to their counterparts, which is of course the case for one side, for the other well... People don't understand just how deep in shit we are.
What a monumental occasion. Third President of the United States has been impeached. This is the second big historical event of my life following 9/11. What a great day to be American and have people in the house of representatives supporting what is right for our country.
The 4 "democrats" to not vote in favor of impeachment:


JEFF VAN DREW - NEW JERSEY; COLLIN PETERSON - MINNESOTA; JARED GOLDEN - MAINE; TULSI GABBARD - HAWAII
Please stop commenting that we are celebrating too early. We arn't dumb, we know he isn't removed. But he has been officially impeached which is BIG. So let us rejoice.
Register to vote Republicans out of office in November 2020.
I’d like to submit the following as my final comment of the night:

Fuck Mitch McConnell
Not a single Republican chose country over party. Shameful.
Impeachment happened because you voted in 2018. Your vote mattered then and it matters now.

Bring your neighbors, family members, friends, everyone you know to vote in 2020. 

This was step 1, and voting out all those who voted nay tonight is step 2.
197 pieces of shit
Dear history,

Yes, these past three years have been as fucked as you are imagining. 

Voting matters.

Voting matters SO FUCKING MUCH.
Just take a step back and look at it objectively.

If there was no abuse of power, why didn’t Trump provide exculpatory evidence and witnesses to absolve himself?

If there wasn’t enough evidence to charge abuse of power, then that is on the part of the president and state department for not providing the evidence and witnesses subpoenaed by the House.

If there was no obstruction of congress, then why are you saying there’s not enough evidence when that was purposely ordered by the president to prevent incriminating himself by complying.

If you think this president is right in ignoring congress, then you’re fine with any future President ignoring congress. Republican or Democrat.
Fuck you Trump.
Treasons greetings y'all.
You spineless republican fucks
We need to hold the moderate republican senators accountable in every way possible, demonstrations, calls, and funding their re-election opponents. There's a slim chance we can convince them to vote in favor of removal, since all they really care about is their re-election chances. Either way please register to vote.
Tulsi Gabbard: Entire campaign is about how she is a proud miltary veteran who will be tough on Trump

Also, Tulsi Gabbard: A complete and whole ass coward who voted fucking present on a fucking impeachment vote.
Fuck Tulsi Gabbard.
Jail to the Chief.

You should've resigned when you had the chance, bozo.

Thank you Democrats for defending the Constitution.
Let people downplay this now with “won’t go through the senate” or ”doesn’t mean anything drr drrr drrr” (sort by controversial to find these large-brains) but the fact that they can never ever dispute, and that trump can never ever erase...**donald j trump is the third person ever in over 200 years of our nation to be impeached.** He wasn’t the first, and some day there might be a fourth. Might even *be* trump if we get our hands on the Mueller stuff. But at this time, **donald j trump is the third president to be impeached.** We know he won’t be removed because the traitors are in the majority but this is a red letter date in history and anyone who downplays it doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
Tulsi voted present

Coward
This is the first time I have followed politics so closely. I watched every hearing I could. I have long considered myself a conservative, but this isn’t the GOP I believed in. What happened today is EXACTLY what needed to happen for the sake of our democracy, now it’s time for senate conservatives to stand up for country instead of a failed and misguided GOP. I was here.

Prediction:  This won't be the last time he's impeached.
[Protester snuck into trumps “please like me rally”](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1207474726861516800?s=20)

Fucking beautiful.
Trump is a disgrace to the office of the presidency.
Best. Cake day. Ever.
If Pelosi were to hold off on moving the charges to the Senate, that would be diabolically genius. No acquittal, just another blot on Trump’s utterly ugly record
Let's not forget an entire day of political theater preceded this historic vote and not one single Republican offered a defense of the president's conduct. They pounded the table on procedure and disinformation but at the end of the day the truth and justice prevailed. The Senate can aquit the president but he will always have this stain of justice on his legacy.
https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI_S3_C6_1_3_2/

The Constitution requires an impartial “oath or affirmation”. McConnell has already indicated that he would not be impartial. Thus, he has abdicated his responsibility under the constitution. 

Pelosi should absolutely require either a trial full of witnesses or an anonymous vote for removal.
You know, it's really interesting to see how so many Trump supporters show up to say that Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot for the upcoming election. I mean, I'm sure Trump fans just have the best interests of Democrats at heart and don't want to see them make a mistake so they're just offering up their honest political advice.

Either that, or they're trying to divide the Democratic base over impeachment in order to dampen enthusiasm for the election. I don't know, which makes more sense?
Holy shit the bots are out in full force today.
If you are thirty:

- You’ve seen two Presidents impeached
- You’ve seen two elections rigged by the electoral college
- You’ve seen an illegal war
- You’ve seen the longest war in American history
- You’ve seen a financial collapse that rivals the Great Depression
- And you’ve see the beginning of an environmental armageddon
Very legal & very cool
Two dems voted Nay. Vote em out and get other Dems in

Edit: 3 Nay and 1 present
Fuck Trump. That’s all.
Even if the senate doesn't remove, it was important to at least get some push back from the democrats. Trumpykins has been doing far too much and getting away with it, and there needs to be consequences.

"But that's just going to hand the election to the republicans!".

That's a bunch of nonsense from the republicans to get democrats to not even put up a fight.
The best part about this (besides not letting corrupt people get away with their crimes) is that this will always haunt Trump. No matter what he says, no matter what he does, this will always eat away at him and be one of the first things that always comes up when people think of him. Just like Nixon. The only thing people remember him for is his impeachment hearings and Watergate.
I think a vote of present tells me every thing we need to know about Tulsi Gabbard.
Since Senators must take an oath to be impartial jurors in this process, is there anything to hold McConnell and Graham accountable, as they vowed to not be impartial?

Edit: Wouldn’t they essentially be committing perjury?
Thank you Democrats for doing what’s right and Schiff for delivering some of the best speeches I’ve ever heard

Does he even read notes? he has nailed so many speeches throughout this process with perfect cadence and eye contact 

If listening to those speeches doesn’t make you feel at least a little more patriotic than you’re dead

No matter what happens in the senate the house performed its job today
This thread has over 580 awards, wow.

Now everyone needs to get out and vote at every election from small local elections on up to 2020 and beyond. We need to keep this going.
We wish you a Merry Impeachment

And  a Happy Fuck Trump.
The "Party of Law and Order" has defended the President who has broken the law. 

This is historic.
I’m currently in a bar full of trump supporters... I so badly want tot tell them all to fuck off...
A lot of folks say this means nothing since he likely won't be removed from office, but I disagree. Trump now can't be pardoned. That's no small deal. Plus, with 50% of the country now in support of Trump's removal, this holds senators accountable for their trial votes and could help swing the 2020 election in Democrats' favor for both the presidency and for senate seats. https://www.newsweek.com/trump-impeached-house-literally-unpardonable-1475096
I've given this a lot of thought. At one point, I strongly considered that pursuing Impeachment might be the wrong move, ONLY because of the GOP majority in the senate that almost guarantees he will not be removed. But, sometime in the last week, my view really cemented: this is the right move.

Even though removal is unlikely, this is still an indelible stain on the record of his presidency. 5 or fewer presidents have been Impeached. I phrase it that way because some people count Nixon and some don't, since I seem to recall he resigned before the impeachment vote. Regardless, this stage of Impeachment is exceedingly rare, and a definite statement about the level of faith our countrymen and their representatives are willing to grant to the executive. It is extremely important that some permanent record be made denoting that a LARGE part of our country absolutely does not support Trump's actions and behaviour.

America and her people are putting up as much resistance as they can against this regime, and our CHECKS and BALANCES give us better avenues to do so than most nations before. To use a trite comparison, Nazi Germany never Impeached Hitler. This vote shows the will of at least one powerful part of those CHECKS and BALANCES against the executive standing up to it and saying "no."

As a final thought, I will mention my general belief that the right thing to do is always the right thing to do. One shouldn't ONLY do the right thing because it is the move that wins; it is sufficient simply to be decisively in the right. I fully believe that our American system of governance is one of, if not THE, best in our world's history, and I am glad that at least one of our parties and the branch they control are willing to protect it strongly.
At the very least I appreciate the precedent this is setting. 

Do we really want to put up with future presidents defying subpoenas and shit?  That's gong to get exhausting.  At least we tried to check that behavior and it will be on record for future presidencies.
#MERRY IMPEACHMAS!

Trump was beet red at his retiree Klan rally today. It was glorious. Looking forward to the Twitter tantrum.
Republicans bring up jesus, Hillary Clinton and Pearl Harbor. 

What a bunch of whack jobs. The whole party is an embarrassment.
“Impeachment means nothing”

It actually means quite a bit:

It means history will look back upon this presidency with at least some pride in America for fighting back. It means the Republican Party will be forced to go on record as voting against our democracy. It means Trump is added to a very significant and very short list of infamy. It gives us the motivation to go out and vote for people who value the citizens of this country over  their personal wealth and well being.

If you think impeachment means nothing, technically, you’re right.

But if this impeachment is the first step towards creating a government that truly works for the interests of ALL PEOPLE, well, then this impeachment means everything.
For the record:

2018 mid-term elections happened during the final stages of the Mueller investigation.  Overwhelming victory for Dems in the House.

2019 state-level elections, mostly in red states, happened **DURING** the impeachment inquiry.  Trump endorsed and campaigned for several of the Republican candidates.  Dems won in a solid majority of the races.

In conclusion, no, impeachment does not improve Trump's chances of winning in 2020.  If anything, it does the opposite.
America is so fucking broken right now... commenting for historical reasons, so I can look back at this and wonder how things ever even got to the point where this corrupt lunatic is in power, abusing his office beyond historic precedent, and yet there’s a legitimate portion of the population insane enough to support him. Honestly it makes me so confused and depressed to think about how this is truly reality at the moment, and the numb/paralyzed feeling of not being able to do anything about it. Please vote people...please let there be change, we have to fix this system and our country.
This decision brought to you by the dedicated American men and women who voted in the mid-term elections of 2018. This is why it’s so important that everyone cast a ballot in every local, state and federal election — and why one particular party is working so hard to ensure that it doesn’t happen.
A sad day for Republicans to again show how much they hate this country.  There is no excuse for allowing this traitor to continue to tarnish our reputation, tank our trade, destroy credibility with allies, eliminate the last semblance of class in politics, and many more travesties.   With more and more top officials resigning and his picks getting put in jail, the country grows ever weaker.  Russia has all but won the cold war, as Putin's bidding is being done from the inside.  Who knew, all it would take is fooling the weak.
Tulsi Gabbard...WTF is wrong with you?
People keep saying he's gonna win 2020, but this has nothing to do with the upcoming election..this is about a man who tried to use America and the highest office in the world for personal gain.

This is about upholding the Constitution and showing that no one is above the law. And this is a nation of laws.
What an unfortunate time to be an American that it has had to come to this, but I’m glad the record will show that this person was impeached regardless of the outcome in the senate. 

Please vote in 2020, our country depends on it.
Bernie Sanders: "Today is a sad but necessary day for American democracy. The U.S. House has voted to impeach President Trump, and that is the right thing to do."
First president to ever be impeached in their first term. Carry that stain with you forever, you fucking disgrace.
I watched the majority of the debate today, and I have concluded: Every member of the Republican Party in Congress is living in another reality.

They repeated 'wasting taxpayer dollars", who was it that ran those Benghazi investigations for years? Or what about the repeal ObamaCare votes? 

They also kept bringing up 63 million votes for Trump, completely disregarding the 65 million Clinton received.
The reason that Democrats were expecting impeachment from the day he won the election is that Trump was a known criminal, liar and cheat.  They were right to be on guard. Republicans would’ve swarmed Obama had he done anything remotely close to this.
Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States*, is a criminal. For the fist time in his life he has been caught & he can't weasel his way out of it. 

Get fucked you traitorous fraud!
Trump finally won the popular vote.
Republicans: "The Democrats are just impeaching Trump for political gain!"

Also Republicans: "The Democrats are committing political suicide by impeaching Trump!"

Pick one. They can't both be right, but they can both be wrong.
[Here's video of Trump in 2014 saying what being impeached would do to Obama: "He would be a mess. He would be thinking about nothing but. It would be a horror show for him. It would be an absolute embarrassment. It would go down on his record permanently."](https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1207313493952802816?s=20)
This is awesome!  As a lifelong Republican (I didn't vote for Trump though because he exhibited signs of mental instability even before the election), I've headed over to the Democratic side specifically because i have no idea WTF is wrong with Republicans these days. Comparing Trump to Jesus??  Saying Trump was given no opportunity to participate in these impeachment trials when [actually he declined to participate](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/white-house-response-judiciary-letter/index.html).  The Republican's mindless following of Trump is very sad--and shocking--to see.
Tulsi basically said "I think that he is guilty, but should not be punished for it."

And again a thank you to all who voted in 2018.
Presidents have literally resigned for less than this.
Not ONE of almost 200 elected republican representatives had enough spine to go country over party. May history never forget this and never forget their names. Traitors.
Trump needs to shut the fuck up about how "good" the economy is when 78% live paycheck to paycheck and America is still the ONLY major country on earth without universal healthcare.

President Donald Trump has been impeached by the US House of Representatives, on the charge of abuse of power, by a final vote of 230-197.
Fuck all the house Republicans who talk about preserving the vote of 63 million who voted for him, but shit all over the 65 million who didnt.
The fact that NOT ONE SINGLE Republican voted for either of the articles, while not surprising, is still a truly sickening sign of the deep rot in the party that has finally openly manifested itself in the last 3-4 years.
Go fuck yourself, Republicans.
Now it's up to us. The Senate will likely not remove Trump from office, so now it's up to us, the American people, to vote him out of office. So come rain, snow, or hell, go out there and vote.
At the end of the day, this was a sound decision to follow through on. If for some reason you think the democrats should not have done this, it would be because 1. You think the articles of impeachment raised are not actually legitimate or 2. You would prefer congress to ignore legitimate wrongdoings by the president to win future elections. Sure, Donald Trump will probably not be removed from office. But, unless he resigns, he will never be pardoned AND it was the right thing to do if you truly think there were legitimate articles to be raised.
Flush that turd down the drain!
I wish my atheist liberal Texas grandma was alive to see this vote. Hope you're kicking back with Molly Ivans.
This is both a great day and a sad day for America. I know he won’t be removed in the Senate so I’ll be ready to vote against him as a first time voter in 2020.

None of this would be possible if you guys didn't win back the house 🔵🔵🔵
I'm happy to see this happen. Most likely, it will get voted down in the Senate (though there's still time for some investigative journalism to reveal something that changes the game). That said, it will go down in the history books that the Democrats did not sit idly by during the horrible things that Trump did. And those in the Senate will also get to be remembered for how they voted in this time, and how they behaved during the proceedings.
This is indeed a great victory in the fight to reclaim American democracy. 

Congratulations from Germany. Now keep up the fight.
It's wikipedia official: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Donald_Trump
I’m picturing Trump right now slamming a mouthful of the allergy medicine meth stashed in his desk and yelling out, “I AM THE SENTATE!” while killing everyone in his office with a lightsaber.
and now for the traitors in the senate to betray democracy
Say what you want about Pelosi, but she's a damn good leader. 

She acts with poise and tact. She acts respectfully even when most would understand her for not doing so. Props to how she's handled this situation every step of the way. This is no easy process to carry out.

> For once in his life, Donald Trump has got something he earned
Don't get me wrong.  I take on this duty with the utmost solemnity. So when I went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of champagne, I made DAMN sure to get something that was REALLY from France, and said "Champagne" on the bottle.  Not "Brut". Not "Sparkling Wine".  Real, bona-fide, Trump-tariffed French Champagne.  It was expensive, but a Trump impeachment happens only once.  (or maybe not). 

Dancing, laughing, and fireworks followed.

Fucking Impeach this motherfucker.
It's not over, yet. 

Please remember that this is an individual who WILL continue to abuse his power and do everything,  legal and illegal, to ensure that he keeps control of his ability to abuse his authority. 

Being the President is a luxury and a privilege handed to one by the people. No one is entitled to the Presidency. Lest this man forget.

It can and will be taken away. 

Do not forget this moment come Nov 2020.

Take a shot for every bot in this thread
I’ve seen so many people across social media that don’t know what “impeached” means. Half of them are arguing that he hasn’t been impeached yet, and the other half think he’s already been removed from office. 

Please educate yourself, people.
Do we refer to him as Impeached President Trump now?
PSA: yes, we're all aware Trump will not be removed from office. This is still democracy in action though and Trump will forever be known as the 3rd president to be impeached. That will never change.
We need 4 non-Dem Senators to defect and not authorize McConnell to rush through without witnesses. 4. If we can get there, it's a big difference between the Senate just immediately acquitting. There are rumors that Moscow Mitch doesn't have the 51 votes he needs to just push it through.

>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has so far batted down demands by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to subpoena documents and witnesses, signaling he will instead ram through a White House–friendly trial that leads to a speedy acquittal.

>But Schumer has indicated he will force a vote to compel the appearances of four witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. The move would cause all eyes to shift to **Republican Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska**—the chamber's most likely GOP members to rebuke the president. They are considered toss-ups on whether they'll back Trump's removal.

>However, it remains to be seen if any of those three will break with McConnell to approve Schumer's demands, as they hold their cards close. The Kentucky Republican can afford to have only two of his members succumb to the New York Democrat's wishes.

I think Manchin is another possibility
Remember, even if the Senate accquits Trump, he'll forever have the stain of impeachment attached to his Presidency.  And there's nothing that rotund orange can do about it
The Senate will do nothing but the fact that the house did the right thing is still a small win for democracy.
Now, many are assuming that we know what the senate will do. But the process may be more nuanced.. Will the Senate majority leadership have the balls to even go on record at all? Moscow Mitch doesn't want the republican controlled senate going on record for legislation passed by the house, why would this be any different? They are spineless if they refuse to vote on it.
Well at least we made this happen, I’m sure the senate being lead by some of the most corrupt people in America will protect their orange King but this has got to absolutely piss him off.
I don’t know what good it will do but I called my senators and made sure they understood how I believe they should vote.
No matter what happens to Trump, this will leave a stain on his legacy. Deservedly so

Watching Trumps rally. Dude sounds like one of the homeless guys on the corner talking about the end of the world and shit. Dude needs to take a breath, his face is lava orange with rage.
Next stop: *VOTE TRUMP OUT!*

Don't take your eyes off the Electoral College numbers...
I know this is a historic moment, but I just can’t get over how horrible republicans are as a whole. Just slimy, deceitful, opportunistic assholes. They hate Trump but kiss his ass like he’s Jesus because they want his voters. I’d bet everything that if a bunch of polls came out indicating Pence would win the election they’d drop Trump in a second.
Republicans dug their own graves after going down with the trump-tanic, your party will go the way of the Whigs and Know Nothing's, good riddance.

“What are you going to do? Impeach me?” - Guy who was just Impeached
From the Steny Hoyer speech in the House Chamber ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html)): 

" We need not ask who will be the first to show courage by standing up to  President Trump. The question we must now ask is, who will be the last  to find it?”  . . .

“Let  us not allow the rule of law to end, or for tyranny to find its  toehold,” he said. “With our votes today, we can bear true faith and  allegiance to the vision of our founders, and we can show future  generations what it truly means to be Americans first. Vote ‘yes.’”

There was a moment’s pause as his words reverberated throughout the chamber, followed by a wave of applause from Democrats.
You know they talk a lot about how this is going to “rile up his base,” I think it’s going to rile up everyone who is sick of him even more.
*Treason’s greetings* Mr. President.
I mean, that's kind of what happens when you elect a corrupt "businessman" and reality TV star. What were you expecting?

Just basking in the joy that comes with the idea of someone with his magnitude of an ego suddenly realizing that this is what he’ll most be remembered for a generation from now.
There will never be an inquiry

They will never find enough evidence to draft a report

They will never draft articles

They will never make it to the full house floor

They will never pass, not even a single one <- **Increasingly nervous Trump supporter is here**

They'll never transmit them to the senate

They'll never hold an actual trial

They'll never actually remove him from office
[deleted]
Please REMEMBER THIS "Representatives Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Jared Golden of Maine and Collin Peterson of Minnesota were the only Democrats to oppose one or both of the charges against President **Trump"** For those of you in those states, DO NOT let this slide!

Edit: Also Tulsi Gabbard
There are people who still believe that Trump is being railroaded. Nope. Trump earned this one all by himself. 

1. The POTUS confessed to the crime on TV - twice. 

2. The House had a by-the-book investigation into his crimes. 

3. The Mueller Report details his complicity in the Russian meddling and we were warned that it would happen again. 

4. The POTUS bragged that he would do it again.

5. His own transcript proves that he committed a crime.

6. Witnesses to the crime came forward and testified. 

7. Conservatives are the first to tell you that they don't consider the US a democracy.

8. Giuliani is still out there acting as an unauthorized agent of the state department and an unauthorized foreign agent. 

9. His two henchmen (Igor and Lev) are under arrest and are spilling what they know to Congress and hoping to stay out of jail. 

10. The Justice Department has more investigations pending on other criminal activities of the POTUS aside from this particular case. 

11. We haven't even discussed the IRS whistleblower scandal that will no doubt be another round of high crimes by the POTUS and his minions.

12. Trump has already been named "Individual One" in a criminal case that others have been sent to jail for on his behalf.

Congress can impeach on presidential corruption and bribery. It's in the Constitution.

 

The facts are there for a solid case.
I wanted impeachment to happen because of the implication it had on our history. His presidency will always have an asterisk next to it now. It cannot be erased.
Fuck Trump and all the corrupt Republicans supporting this sack of shit.
It's insane to me that none of the Republicans are debating the facts, just alleging that this is a leftist partisan action. They're using anything to deflect and have brought up Hunter Biden and the false conspiracy that Russia didn't interfere. It's shocking how much they lie or ignore the truth.
to the conservatives saying this will cause a civil war; you’re both psychotic and stupid if you think this is worth getting violent over
Man what a clusterfuck you poor Americans have to go through. Your politicians are fuckin mental
I used to think that this was a useless endeavor but now that he is impeached it does have a good feel to it. We know he won’t be removed but this is not  a futile result. He is being outed to the world for the criminal that he is.  Kudos to the lawmakers and Maconell is just as bad.
No matter how this proceeds, we are witnessing history.
I hope this doesn't make people think they can stay at home and not vote in 2020.  If he's re-elected... fuck me.
Ignore the defeatist trolls. They love to come out of their little woodwork at night. 

They try to shape public opinion by posting on social media. And then they post “why would anyone believe anything they see on social media? Everyone votes on their own free will.”
Commenting on a historic post. Fuck Donald Trump.
[Rick Wilson](https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/1207473623470088193?s=19):

>It's forever, Donald. 

>Forever.

>History will forget all the Fox agitprop and bluster and remember you were impeached.

>You're on the Mt. Rushmore of corrupt Presidents.

>Forever.
I love the people who keep saying that this was a partisan act by Democrats, as shown by the lack of Republicans voting for impeachment.

You do realise that Republicans are voting against because they are being whipped to do so. They know Trump is popular in their constituencies so are trying to maintain power. This means they are not voting with their conscience or looking at the facts, they are simply ignoring the evidence in order to not upset Trump's supporters. Which is wrong.

At this rate, Trump could literally shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and wouldn't lose any voters.

Sigh.
>To put this in context, the last time a President was impeached Donald J Trump only had 8 bankruptcies and was on his 2nd marriage. He now has 11 bankruptcies, 3 marriages, 3,500 legal cases, and has officially been impeached.

If any president has ever deserved to be impeached, it's Trump.
Here are the GOP defenses I have heard so far to articles of impeachment, along with the knee-jerk responses I have been shouting at my television.

────────

Defense 1: Trump did nothing wrong. 

Response: Trump hit the trifecta of impeachable conduct by subverting an election, seeking foreign influence, and putting personal interest ahead of national interest. And he obstructed Congress by refusing to produce any witnesses or documents

────────

Defense 2: No harm occurred because the military aid went through. 

Response: The aid went through only after Trump was caught. In the meantime, months of delay cost Ukraine lives in its war with Russia. US credibility was harmed and moral authority to fight corruption was eroded.

────────

Defense 3: Because aid went through, no misconduct was committed.

Response: Bribery occurs upon demand for a personal favor in exchange for performance of an official act. If you offer a cop $20 to get out of a traffic ticket, even if he declines, you have still committed bribery

────────

Defense 4: Abuse of power is not even a crime. 

Response: Impeachable conduct may be criminal conduct, but need not be. A president could be impeached if he watched TV all day and failed to fulfill his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

────────

Defense 5: There’s nothing wrong with asking for an investigation. 

Response: If this were legitimate investigation, you wouldn’t need to send your personal lawyer and his henchmen to do it. Witnesses say Trump didn’t want investigation, just announcement of investigation.

────────

Defense 6: There was no quid pro quo. 

[Response:] Read the transcript! Trump’s request for a “favor” is strong evidence, corroborated by witness testimony, of months-long scheme to get Zelensky to “go to the mic” and announce Biden probe. Aid was leverage.

────────

Defense 7: As VP, Biden held up aid as leverage to get rid of the Ukrainian public prosecutor. 

Response: It is appropriate for a president or VP to take action to advance the interests of the nation. Trump was advancing his personal interests.

────────

Defense 8: Testimony is hearsay.

Response: Rules of Evidence don’t apply. Also, call summary, Sondland testimony are non-hearsay. Trump has barred direct witnesses. You can’t have it both ways. If they had information favorable to Trump, you can bet we would have heard from them.

────────

Defense 9: It happens all the time. Get over it. 

Response: Trump sought foreign influence in our election and harmed national security by delaying aid designed to fight Russia, our adversary. We don’t have to accept it. We deserve better.

────────

Defense 10: Impeachment would un-do an election. 

Response: All impeachments un-do elections. Constitution permits impeachment if president is unfit to serve. When rigging an election is involved, elections are ineffective for removal. Impeachment is not to punish but to protect.

────────

Defense 11: Impeachment proceedings are moving too fast. 

Response: This impeachment has moved slower than Bill Clinton’s and on pace with Richard Nixon’s. For a president who presents a clear and present danger to national security, removal is urgent and can’t come soon enough

────────

Defense 12: We need to hear from the whistleblower. 

Response: The whistleblower was a tipster, whose tip led to the investigation. Tipsters do not testify at trial, the witnesses do. We have a duty to protect whistleblowers to encourage them to use proper channels to report abuse"
Fuck Tulsi Gabbard
This is a sad day for American democracy, not because the president has been impeached but because an entire party voted to protect a corrupt leader against the interests of the country.

But the fight is not over. Many people will tell you that the Senate is guaranteed to acquit and that's true **if** we the people don't put pressure on them to support a fair trial.

Democrats need four Republicans to side with them in order to be able to call key witnesses such as John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or Mike Pompeo. If you live in a swing state or Utah, call your Senators! Urge Romney, Ernst, Gardner, Tillis, Collins, and Murkowski to support the calling of witnesses. Let them know that you **will** vote them out of office if they vote for McConnell's sham trial procedures.

This is not about Democrat vs. Republican. This is about having a fair trial so the truth can be known. Get Bolton, Mulvaney, and Pompeo on the stand and under oath. Don't take no for an answer. We'll take to the streets if we have to in order to get a real trial.
It's unlikely that this Senate will vote to convict, but it's still important that this was done. Trump will forever have an asterisk on his presidency, and it reaffirms that there are standards that must be upheld in the United States. The President cannot simply do whatever he wants without consequence.
if you voted for the first time in 2018,

please vote again in 2020
Great, now the Democrats need to put this alabatross on the neck of EVERY legislator who voted no and ESPECIALLY the ones in the Senate who will do so.
Well done Trump, you’ve managed to do something Obama didn’t manage.

Be impeached.
I’m glad he’s impeached, but the trial in the Senate is going to be a sham, and he will be acquitted. But at least in the history books it’ll show that Trump was impeached. He can try and spin it any way he wants to, but history will remember that, at least.
Finally impeached. It only took two major investigations, tons of conclusive evidence, and a sensible majority in the house.
Not one republican did the right thing
[deleted]
Hey republicans are winning again, they’re winning in most impeached US presidents in history!
Donald Trump has finally achieved something Barack Obama didn’t.
Fuck 'im. He got what was coming to him.
Historic day to see this government struggle but ultimately get it right. Good on Dems and swing voters that went dem
I certainly hope everyone starts referring to him as disgraced *president Donald Trump
Remember to vote again, again and again we mustn’t let the republicans gain this much power again.
"One day you won't have the majority and it won't be good for you then."

Ah, Republicans, it hasn't been good now and policy threats just make you look worse.
Let him wear the stain for eternity.
Christmas dinner is going to be fun this year.
Trump just tweeted a meme: 

“IN REALITY
THEY ARE NOT AFTER ME
THEY’RE AFTER YOU. 

I’M JUST IN THE WAY.”

This is classic fear mongering and propaganda. Cultists use this tactic, every single one of them.
Things Trump one up-ed Obama on:

Getting impeached.
Pretty awesome.  Every newspaper in the world has Trump's impeachment as the front page.  The UK, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, China, Australia...
Everyone that voted in 2018: *You’re breathtaking*
Finally, Donald won a popular vote!
Gabbard is such a joke *"I'm voting present because I don't want to vote yes since all the Republicans are voting no"*

Are you for fucking real?
10/10 his supporters will defend him to the end like the demented and brainwashed people they are.
So Bill Clinton was impeached for getting his dick sucked by an intern and trump was impeached for sucking Putin's dick. [It’s like poetry, it rhymes ](https://www.deviantart.com/thetechromancer/art/It-s-like-poetry-it-rhymes-778254478)
Enjoy tonight.

But understand that the next several months are going to be an outright battle: A sham Senate trial, a fraudulent report from Barr and Durham, a deluge of Russian disinformation, and a post-acquittal Trump who will feel emboldened to be twice as lawless.

2020 is exhausting already
Trump is currently gaslighting like a mother fucker to a crowd in Michigan. Ive counted 12 lies and around 15 intances of him spweing nonsense.
Trump supporters, instead of wasting your time with a pathological liar who just got impeached why not join a political movement working every day to stop corruption, stop money in politics, and help all. Bernie 2020.
I’d like to thank everyone that went out and voted in 2018, you helped make this happen by voting in a majority into congress. Let’s do it again in 2020, let’s get the presidency and the majority in the senate back!

Make McTurtle watch as we pass every bill he’s blocked from the senate! Fix the SCOTUS and remove every unqualified judicial pick McTurtle forced through. Kick Devos out and fix what she’s destroying. Pass a fairness doctrine again and fine Fox News out of existence. Then investigate every fucking trump enabler in his administration and congress and senate who helped him abuse his power and commit crimes. I want to see every one of them perp walked in handcuffs.
I listened to him talk at his Michigan rally while the voting was finishing.  He’s not a nice man; name calling, degrading, divisive behavior.   Part of me expects that he will humbly recognize that they are upholding our constitution and that he is confident that through a fair process, there will be a determination that it was all just a misunderstanding.

But no, instead he’s out there convincing the crowd that the Democrat party are vicious people, making hateful remarks at individuals who aren’t in his camp.  I’m waiting for him to start passing out kool-aid.  

Ex-Republican here
Fun fact:  Trump has received the 1st and 2nd most amount of votes for Impeachment in history.  More people supported his Articles of Impeachment than Clinton or Johnson.
> One of the highlights of this contentious event was Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) comparing the impeachment inquiry of President Trump to the trial of Jesus Christ, saying that the Christian savior was treated far better by the authorities.

Holy fucking dog shit! These people are just completely insane.
>The House impeaches President Trump for abuse of power, 230-197, with **Tulsi Gabbard voting "present".**

Let's all agree to get rid of her from politics forever k? No more votes for Tulsi. She's obviously out for herself, not the country.
The No Votes from republicans is telling

Spineless cowards

This is the first thing Trump has actually earned in his life.
Fuck Donald Trump.
I like people who weren’t impeached
Who voted present? 

Ahhh, the Russian, Tulsi Gabbard.
Donald Trump is now officially the worst President in American history.
"This is a serious matter, but the foreman of the jury is in cahoots with the defendant's lawyers."

In all seriousness I feel better that Trump feels like he has an out and he doesn't have to cling to power at all costs. He's so narcissistic that he would willingly cause mass destruction just to save his own old ass.
Dictators always flee the country when they get ousted. If they don't they end up in prison or dead.
Weird way to spell flee
Stop.  Don't.  Come back.
Don the Con is looking for a host nation that has no extradition treaty with the U.S.
“I love America but I’ll turn my back on it in a second”

Asswipe
No way trump gets out of the country.  The intelligence community cannot have a former president getting picked up by a hostile party.  Even if its under bad terms they are not letting him leave.  You really are trapped in here with us you dunce
That's such a fun way to say "flee to avoid criminal prosecution"
Is his fleeing the country not a huge security risk? I mean not to make Intelligence jokes, but he’a gotta know some valuable info that could easily be compromised right? Am I correct that if he remains in the US he is guaranteed some form of government security as a (former) President? Do they follow him if he decides to live abroad?
Can New York pull his passport as a flight risk?
Yeah, cause he loses. Not because he'll be going straight to jail, just because he loses. LOL. 

They'll just extradite him probably, he owes a lot of money.
Bye Felicia
Sometime in the last 24 hours I pictured in my  mind Joe Biden's inauguration ceremony with empty chairs where trump would have sat. We will move forward without him and I can only hope that twitter closes his account forever.
There it is. This is him signaling that he’s a flight risk because he knows he’ll end up in prison for the rest of his life once he’s out of office.
Hahha ok who had abscond to Russia on their bingo card, literally everybody?
[This was the greatest 'Trump defecting to Russia' scenario I ever read](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/amiea4/donald_trump_jr_will_be_indicted_by_mueller/efmcem5/)
Because he knows he'll end up in jail.
When danger reared it's ugly head,

He bravely turned his tail and fled.
Imagine being the supporter of a President who says that if he loses an election he'll leave the country. The President's love of the country hinges solely on his supporters level of admiration. Next he's going to tell them to go out and "show how much they love him" for the next 3 weeks.
To a country with no extradition treaty with US.
Oh no.  How terrible.  Don’t do *that,* anything but *that.”

Also he will.  And land in Moscow.
He will go to Russia. It's not even a question. 

And this would also greatly benefit Putin. Put yourself in his shoes: If your goal is to continue the attack on the US, further create chaos drive the political divide, stir unrest, this could easily be accomplished by openly supporting Trump (provide refuge for Trump) and claim the US legal system mistreated him, that the US government is corrupt, and he was cheated. Trump voters/conservatives would lose further faith in the US government and systems, further radicalize them, and would find sympathy with Trump and view Putin more positively. 

Trump being the easily manipulated useful idiot that he is, would 100% go along with this. Plus he wants to avoid financial ruin and prison. So he really has no choice. 

The icing on the cake will be the hard intelligence/national security secrets Trump would hand over. Despite him not really paying attention to intelligence reports or briefings, he still would certainly possess some level of classified/sensitive information about various things (US military readiness, national security, intelligence apparatus to some degree). You don't get a better asset than a former US President. 

Putin/Russia would absolutely love to have this information, and Trump would happily exchange it over for assurances of his freedom, resources, money, etc. Hell, Trump may even direct some of his staff (who flee with him) to gather more stuff to hand over. Odds are Putin is whispering this stuff into his ears right now, priming him to do so. The precedent has already been set as well. Yanukovych fled to Russia (and remains there now) when he was repudiated by Ukraine voters in 2014.
Decided to see what people on r/Conservative had to say about this, this was one of the comments:

>He jokes, but I'm personally very afraid of the authoritarian political prosecution he, his family, and anyone who supported him will face if we lose this election.

Lol, maybe don't commit a bunch of crimes? I swear they'll do anything to protect their god emperor
[deleted]
Lol isn't this what conservatives love to make fun of liberals for saying? But he said it about himself? Lmao
And now he’s laying the groundwork.
Any nation he flees to would have to know that "when America sends people across our borders, they're not sending their best."
I thought he might need to do that anyway.
music to my fucking ears. 

feel the fear, Mr President! 

It takes a worried man, to sing a worried song...
I think he'll be on the first plane to Moscow.
Thank you.
So, he just declared himself to be a flight risk, right? No bail for lil' Donnie.
Let him run.  We ALL knew that's what it would come down to, anyway.

Let him have all his assets seized.

Let him live a few months on the run from US prosecutors, the International Court of Justice AND Russian loan sharks.

Let him live out his last weeks looking over his shoulder in constant fear of capture.

Let him be found living out his last few days of freedom in a fucking hole in the ground covered in his own piss and shit, just like Sadam Hussein.

It's the *only* fitting end to this terrible chapter in our shared story.
Cool. Please take your supporters with you.
Yet another good reason to VOTE!

Seriously though...Trump will likely find the list of countries that will accept him fairly short, and it better be one without an extradition treaty.  

He’ll be a liability, not an asset, once he’s no longer in office to any country.  What little we know about his finances seems to show that he’s underwater too, so he’ll have to scrape to buy his way in.
Oh the irony that will come from trump trying to illegally immigrate to another country

(He will probably try to leave the US illegally)
Hey guys no big deal, but the US President is saying he is going to flee the country if he loses. Totally normal.
Slightly updating an old copypasta because it seems relevant here. The original was deleted but you can find various versions of the original flooding around at this time last year.

***

I really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect during his last months in office. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.

Imagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months its the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the country. Insisting he's still the President and he never really lost the election. 

But then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.

No one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no ones cares.

He's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.

His days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.

His children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.
Free from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose "Stockholm Syndrome" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.

They are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.
Melania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again
Trump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.

He very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.

But within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.

Eventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.

The official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.
The Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.
In death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Some infinite presidents are recognized for the disasters they got us into like the Iraq war and the Vietnam war, but Trump managed to kill far more Americans than that by simple incompetence. A quarter of a million people died as a result of his ego, and then close to that many died the following year while the country worked to sort out the mess he left behind and get the virus under control.

In US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page in the section on politics. In fact he has mentioned far more in the discussion of disasters that hit the United States than on any sort of political achievements - because he didn’t actually achieve anything, he simply failed to act based on his own arrogance. And that’s all he’s remembered for. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as "tacky".

Now he is simply: "What was the name of the President attributed to the largest preventable disaster in American history?”

The answer is "(C) Donald J. Trump"
We could only be so lucky..
Not really a threat though. I mean, we will hunt you down. We found Bin Laden, we will find you too.
He really is worried about being convicted of one of the crimes he's committed in office.
He means "flee to a non-extradition country".
He's going to flee and claim he was run out of the country by the "deep state" over fear for his life. Then he'll live in Russia with his loser kids and use the internet to undermine Biden and further divide our country and disrupt our democracy.
Is he trying to get more people to vote against him? This is perfect meme material to get out the vote against him.
Wow.

Said no one.
"Mr. Vice President, what will your first words be to donald trump if you win the election?"

Joe Biden: "DON'T LEAVE TOWN."
No one will see this comment but it makes me happy to see that Trump realizes he doesn’t have a future in the US unprotected by office.
Lol like the cia is gonna let the guy who has the nuclear football leave the country, if he loses and starts talking crazy he will come down with a illness.
Welp, finally got to this point
...to a country with no extradition treaty with the U.S.
Can he take Mcconnell and the rest with him?

Resign? No. He should rot in jail. He made a decision (using a position for which he was neither elected, confirmed nor qualified) to abandon tens of thousands of people to die for political gain.
He needs to be in prison, they all need to be in prison. Someone tell me how this isn't mass murder?
The trump administration used the Covid virus as a bio-weapon against Democrats. They're domestic terrorists.
Crimes against Humanity.  As a resident of a blue state and a large city we knew that Trump was using the office to target revenge, but this was to let people die.

V O T E
Thousands of people died because they didn’t want to help people that didn’t support them. 

These people are evil.
In case you missed it, if you are a Republican from one of these "blue states" your president just told you your life means jack squat to him. Why does he deserve your vote?
He holds no real position to resign from. He's an unpaid 'special advisor'. IMHO, Trump is solely responsible/guilty for following his advice and should resign as President.
Isn't this the kind of thing international tribunals are set up for? This literally is mass murder.
And it wasn't even a political win.
Let’s not pretend that Trump didn’t have a hand in this as well. Despite Trump’s incompetence and stupidity, Kushner and the others still look the their dear leader for direction.

Everything I want to say is against the rules.
Before Trump's term ends we'll see a blanket pardon for Kuschner and his wife covering all crimes committed over the last four years.
These soulless criminals have cynically murdered tens of thousands of Americans because they believed that it would benefit them politically. In normal times Kushner et al. would be dragged before an international tribunal to answer for what surely can only be described as crimes against humanity. But for the Trump administration? It's just Friday.
This is criminal. He needs to go before the Hague.
He was put in a west wing office *because* these are his values. Ivanka is every bit as depraved and repugnant. They’ll all be in jail in the next few years. It will become unavoidable.
He shouldn’t resign, he should be charge with murder.

He found it politically advantageous to support spreading a virus to kill thousands of people in blue states.


Just like he found it personally politically advantageous to help that Saudi prince chop up an American journalist.

Kushner has no soul, And has made it clear, other people’s lives mean absolutely nothing to him so long as he can profit from your death.
trump really is the most incompetent president our nation has ever seen and rather than admit it MAGA people would rather just kick and scream about emails, the clintons, Obama, the deep state and Benghazi. sad.

When does letting thousands of people die because of their voting districts become official genocide, exactly?
Is genocide too strong a word for this? I don’t want to be disrespectful using this word, but it really seemed that once it was clear the virus was going to be more damaging to lower income areas and especially people of color that the federal response halted dramatically.
Does this fucker actually play any legally valid role in federal government?
If someone went around shooting thousands of people living in blue states, they'd face life in prison or execution. It is a terrible injustice that "demands for his resignation" is the most punishment he'll face for essentially being a mass murderer. Intentionally took actions that he knew would kill hundreds of thousands. People should be calling for his arrest, not his resignation.
Republicans - Defend this.
if you know anything about the war on drugs you know enacting policy SPECIFICALLY to harm liberals is nothing new
Nazi weasel
Not only are Trump and Kushner evil, but the MAGA supporters and Republican leadership that acquiesce are evil as well.  This is as bad as a war crime.
I'd be willing to bet that absolutely nothing comes of this, which is just crazy to me. Trump and his cronies will gaslight this to death and there will be a new story tomorrow.
How is this not fucking treason?
Murderer.

Prison for life. Nothing less.
I read the actual article from Vanity Fair, and it said someone on his task force said it would be politically advantageous for them to let it go since it's in blue states and makes Dem governor's look bad. Kushner was there but there is no reaction from him. 

Then they completed what looked like a decent start of a plan and they handed it off to Jared to be taken to the President late in March with the expectation of the group members that it would be announced the following week. And it died for no known reason.

So the underlying article does not say Jared killed the plan to kill Democrats, but it certainly appears that the President might have when it got to him, or at minimum, he was doing what we all knew he was doing at the time. Denying the problem so the stock market would do well. 

It was a long article and maybe I missed something, but that is how I read it.

Edit. Some typos.
I wonder what Mega-Corporation he's going to fail upwards into after this administration. Seems perfect for Nestle.
Reminder that last year Trump threatened to pull federal funds from California wildfires over politics. This is a pattern.
Charge him with genocide. Take this bastard to the Hague.
This is mass murder. Call it like it is. Bring those MOFOS to court!
Send him to The Hague
I would hope he is charged with murder for sacrificing people to further donald's election chances. If he deliberately allowed people to die when he could have helped, he needs to be prosecuted!
This is nothing short of treason
I don't know how you don't qualify this as mass murder of American Citizens due to political alignment. This is closer to a war crime.
How about we talk about a punishment fitting for mass murder? What would that be?
...Is this why the Feds _also_ siezed PPE from blue states?

...at the direction of Jared Kushner?
This falls under the category of crimes against humanity. He should be prosecuted by the international court.

US Federal Government's action toward Global Disease Preparedness by the in 2018:

* Global health security team which was to lead the U.S. response in the event of a pandemic was disbanded.

* CDC was forced to slash its efforts to prevent global disease outbreak by 80% as its funding for the program began to run out.

* The Complex Crises Fund ($30 million emergency response pool) that was at the secretary of state’s disposal to deploy disease experts and others in the event of a crisis was cut.

* Fired and did not replace the homeland security advisor on the National Security Council. He was responsible for coordinating the US response to a pandemic

* Trump team failed to follow NSC’s pandemic playbook, the 69-page document, finished in 2016, provided a step by step list of priorities – which were then ignored by the administration.

* Trump's Fascism:

Fascism has been said to be a political philosophy that is followed to obtain power and not necessarily a blue print for governing. It is achieved by predominantly playing to the uneducated and shallow thinking masses, and keeping them from being educated in critical thinking.

Umberto Eco speaks of ur-fascism (a generic right wing dictatorship complimentary to but different than fascism). He also has fourteen characteristics of fascism in his essay Ur-Fascism and also stated **"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it".**

https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf

2 problems with the DHS response in Portland:

1. Anticipatory arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.

2. Non-custodial arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.

Violations of the 4^th and 14^th amendments.

James Waterman Wise Jr. said, in February of 1936, when fascism comes to the US "it will probably be “wrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution.”

3 of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here(Lawrence Britt Spring 2003 based upon the article "The Hallmarks of Fascist Regime" by Skip Stone):

* **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**

Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.

 * **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**

The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  

* **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**

**Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.**There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

* **Fraudulent Elections**

Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. **Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.**

2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here

* **Religion and Government are Intertwined**

Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.

* **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**

Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.

2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here

* **Corporate Power is Protected**

The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.

* **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**

Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

Kushner for prison 2021
There is no better example I think of corruption, nepotism, and corporate interests being held in higher regard than public safety than this fucking ghoul. The fact that he has such a high level of influence should be a pretty good indication that American politics as a whole has failed.
#It's the whole Republican party that deserves the blame, folks. 

Pointing to any one member of it is a fool's game, and lets the organization as a whole off the hook.

There is no Kushner without Trump. And there is no Trump without the rest of the GOP that elected him, abets his destruction of institutions and lives, defends him in the face of treason, and even now is working tirelessly to re-elect him.

Every GOP politician has to go. The party is a danger to the nation and must be eradicated, root and branch, every single representative.

VOTE.
Resign?  These people should be jailed.
That’s literally genocide. He doesn’t need to resign, they all need to be removed from office and prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
"Sir, we have news that Japanese aircraft assaulted our base in Hawaii."
"What does it matter. Hawaii is a blue state, right?"
Fuck the resignation. Put this fucker in prison
This is not "resign" material. This is "tribunal for crimes against humanity" material. This is "meet me in central park" material. 

There is no justice but the justice we make for ourselves. _Who will create justice for this?_
What do you get when you fill a government with a bunch of narcissists?
Resignation? How about prison? This should be a criminal issue.
So a genocide.  We're talking about a genocide.  

They tried to let the virus spread because they though it would kill enough people for them to gain more power.

>Currently, the KKK are classified as a domestic extremist group **as there is no definition for domestic terrorism organizations in the U.S.**

For all those people in this thread who are asking why they haven’t been listed as such already it’s because there is no legal domestic terrorist organization list or process to have one, it’s also why trumps threat to label something as nebulous as antifa as domestic terrorists is not part of the legal process and it’s just him using words he doesn’t understand.
I’m not American and I’m surprised they haven’t been declared a terror group. Seriously?! Not any time in the last 40 years?
I'm not expecting anything to happen on this anytime soon, but it is one hell of a good wedge issue for the October campaign ads.
One of those things I assumed was always the case, and now that I'm learning it's not I feel like an "oh for fucks fucking sake, America!" is warranted, and I'm American.
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge that they are also grown ups who wear ghost costumes and call themselves wizards and dragons? I mean, awful, horrible people who do horrible things...but also....
>The State Department says a group must be a *foreign* organization who engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of the U.S. or American citizens to be listed as a terrorist organization.
>
>
>This means that foreign groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda are listed as terrorists, but the KKK are not.
>
>
>The definition also suggests Trump may not be able to class antifa as terrorists, who are also seen as a movement rather than a coordinated organization.
>
>
>People who express far-right and white supremacist views are protected by the First Amendment. As domestic terrorism is not a federal offense, those accused of acting on behalf of the KKK or other far-right groups while carrying out an attack or other crimes can only face hate crimes charges.

For those of you asking why a group like the KKK wouldn't already be classified this way, and that may not have actually read the article, there's no legal grounds to designate a domestic group as terrorists.

In order to label them as such, the laws around how we designate terrorist groups would need to change. They can't just be officially classified as a terrorist group.

I doubt many people that signed the petition actually understand what this designation means and how it's used. Likely, it simply sounds good to them to designate the KKK as a terrorist group because fuck the KKK.
As little as I like any racial supremacy group, we really need to be repealing the patriot act instead of utilizing it. It can be used to brand anything as "terrorism". We're on a slippery slope.
I thought you couldn’t declare an American group a terrorist group. Same reason people doubt it is legal to designate antifa a terrorist group.

WHERE IS IT

Antifa, which stands for "anti fascists," who are people dedicated to stopping fascism so we don't have a repeat of Nazi Germany and another mass genocide, are considered to be terrorists by this president.

However, the KKK, a group dedicated to lynching African Americans and other minorities, is not considered to be a terrorist group by this president.

SMH.
Trump will never declare his base a terrorist group ...
The amount of people so resistant to this idea in this comment section is astounding.
Im not certain but I think the reason it hasn’t been declared one before is because they have never declared a domestic organisation a terrorist group, but since Trump has declared antifa a terrorist group people are calling for the KKK’s declaration as well.

Disclaimer; fuck the KKK

However, terrorism is the use of force or intimidation to further ones political goals. In my 30 years the only time I've seen a klansman come out of the woods was on Jerry Springer and Im pretty sure he was just an actor. I certainly believe the Klan deserves to be labeled a "hate group" by the ADL but until the start burning crosses in people's front yards again I don't think the label terrorist applies. What they do now out in the woods now is not much different from some weird occult cult activity, its not like their sacrificing black babies out there or anything and I'm pretty sure the feds have agents implanted in their ranks so we would know about it if they did. 

My fear is that pushing these people even further when we've already driven them out of society with social pressure will only lead to them taking violent actions once again. They already believe they are losing "their country" to POC and the Jews. If we start prosecuting them as terrorists without due cause that will only strengthen their beliefs that they are being persecuting and will only radicalize them further. If they are content with going out in the woods, burning a few crosses, chanting, then getting drunk and having a bbq then frankly I'm happy where they're at. 

I'm actually a big fan of Daryl Davis, the black musician who goes to these klan rallies and befriends the members. I believe the only way to get people to stop believing in the klan is to show them they are wrong, not using the force of the law. You can't legislate people's beliefs, but you can show them they are wrong.
Baffles me people against terrorists (antifa) would be considered terrorists before the fucking KKK
While the KKK is certainly morally equivalent to terrorism, I hope people realize that anti-terrorism laws essentially are designed to circumvent due process and constitutional rights.  These laws essentially justify state-sponsored terrorism, a form of police brutality.

This also sets a precedent to treat politically motivated domestic crime as terrorism, including looting and rioting.

A better approach to racial justice would be to abolish terrorism as a legal concept and treat political crimes as any other crimes. Had we treated 911 as a crime rather than a terrorist act, we wouldn't have entered into decades of war in the middle east under false pretenses. And we wouldn't have allowed innocent people to be imprisoned in Guantanamo for decades. We wouldn't be engaging in extra-judicial killings around the world, using drones.

To be clear, the concept of terrorism is nothing more than a legal justification for state-sponsored terrorism.
A lot of southern politicians have deep ties to the KKK. Designating them as a terrorist group would make it more difficult for them to collect funds from their offshoot branches disguised as legitimate business fronts and church groups. KKK is surprisingly a well funded group because of the proxies they use to accrue large donations.
Goddammit /r/politics, do you remember why Antifa couldn't be declared a terrorist group? [This was 11 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gu2dr1/trump_says_us_will_designate_antifa_as_a/). The not centrally located, domestic, lack of authority and constitutionally protected speech/assembly reasons still apply.

Please think a little harder before trying to grant this power to the government. It should be plainly obvious why it's a bad idea.
Does anyone think that the president who said: ”very fine people on both sides” and whose father had Klan ties will sign anti-Klan legislation?
Ok now follow me here... The Klan has killed or harmed how many people this century? Yet the local police and government forces on the other hand... yes the kkk is horrible and ignorant but they arent even playing in the same league as the other groups. All this bullshit the government is doing is pitting us against each other! Americans should be anti police and anti government infringement and EVERYONE on the same team. They keep us focused on petty shit so we dont unite against them while mainstream media  just pushes their agendas and further separates us. We should be unhyphenated, just one people and "we" should mean all of us against their 1%. United we stand and divided we fall was coined as an important term for a reason. I love you all and wish you all peace. Have a blessed day
It baffles me that we are in 2020.. and you still have this hate group around like a normal thing..
KKK is a weird thing. Not sure why anyone would join. It’s also an invitation to be arrested by the feds. 

It’s also weird that it isn’t classified as a terrorist organization anyway. Makes me wonder what the hell it is classified as...a charity?
Long past due! It is a joke that Antifa gets labelled as one (anti-fascism is what WWII was all about) yet the KKK does not? Are you kidding me?
While I'm generally not a fan of groups being categorized as terrorists by popular vote, it's clear that the KKK has been excluded because of their deep ties to the creation of law enforcement in this country and to their current operation.
God sorting by new is disgusting. What the fuck does the BLM movement and antifa have to do with any of this? Just say that you’re racist and go.
Man im still surprised the kkk is still a thing
Everytime Trump opens his hole, he "himself" incites racial devide. Trump is the worst president this country has ever had!  He hides in his bunker because of "bone spurs" and spews incoherent demands of which doesn't make any sense.  His base is filled with racists, "why would he turn on them?"  He needs them this November along with Russia!  Just sad.
I thought it was kinda common knowledge they were a terrorist group?
Yes they fucking are terrorists fuck the kkk
Totally agree, since we have a unhinged president hell-bent on destroying freedom of speech, we should absolutely give him the power to arbitrarily label groups as "terrorist" /s

I'm not sure why this apparently comes as a surprise to so many Americans, but if you give the government a new power, they're not going to stop at only using it in ways you agree with.

Sure, we could have given Obama the power to arrest people engaging in "hate speech", and perhaps he would have used it to great effect to suppress hate, but guess what Donald Trump would have labeled as "hate speech" on his first day in office? All criticism of him. 

Whether you agree or disagree with any one particular group or message is irrelevant, the question you need to evaluate is if the government should be given the power to police all groups and messages, and I would hope you would realize that that's an awful idea.
Is that even possible under the 1st amendment?
Since theres no legal framework to declare a US based organization a terrorist group, could say, Canada make a declaration allowing the US to have a source for trying KKK members as terrorists?
TIL : The KKK is actually still a thing.. 🙄
I’m sure Susan Collins will say they’ve learned their lesson, before putting her hood on and joining Trump at the rally.
I'll sign that
There are a bunch of people in these comments trying to say the Klan is almost non-existent or mostly harmless. Instead of trying to engage with these Colin Robinsons, I'm just going to post the SPLC Hate Map for everybody's general perusal. https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map
Well there goes the trump supporters the grand wizard in the white house is going to veto
The KKK has been given a free pass in America since the terrorist organization began so very many years ago. In them you can see a clear reflection of the US as a whole. The racism, terror, and violence never stopped, they just became less open about it because society largely frowns upon such disgusting behavior. 

Disturbingly, a number of their ranks successfully infiltrated the police force all over the country. Yes, make no mistake about it, some of those white robes were very purposefully traded in for blue uniforms. Some individuals have been outed, but of course rarely dealt with. Others seem to quite literally have taken control over various police departments, giving them the power and immunity to commit heinous acts that we have only just scratched the surface of. The FBI has admitted to being aware of all of this, and yet has refused to ever condemn the KKK or other white supremacists groups as the terrorists organizations they are.
Instead, they have spent their resources on attempting to brand groups like BLM and ANTIFA as dangerous terrorist group, even going as far as to keep surveillance on members of those groups for years. 
Predictably, they have consistently failed to find any discernible threat with these groups, but have come out and begrudgingly said that the deadly threats they have regularly happened upon have nearly ALL been white supremacist-related. Some they are able to stop, and others become the latest mass shooting splashed across the news. 

Meanwhile, a number of black organization members and leaders have turned up dead under extremely suspicious circumstances. It's terrifying.
Here’s my logic on this. KKK represents white supremacy. White supremacy is tantamount to fascism. Fascism was the reason Europe fought against Hitler and beg the US to join the fight. Once the US was dragged onto it, it fought against the subjugation of the world by fascist rule. 

To sum up, the US, having been involuntarily enjoined onto the fray, fought in a WORLD WAR, whereby millions died, the depth of depravity of Germany’s Hitler led Nazi regime was laid bare for all nations to see. Fought and won to END THIS debauched and degenerate nation state as a threat to free people everywhere, it is quite simply a no brainer to declare the KKK and any associated spin-off charters a terrorist organization entitling the full force of local, state and federal to be applied against their eradication. 

Free speech is NOT an absolute.
KKK? NRA? Maybe a connection? just sayin'...
Come on, people. Stop comparing the KKK to antifa, either explicitly or implicitly.

"Antifa" is **not a group**. "Antifa" is much closer to "me too" and "socialism" and "pro-LGBT" as a set of loose sociopolitical ideals. Quit comparing (or contrasting) it to an established organization with structured hierarchy, membership requirements, club website, etc. These should not part of the same argument, and only a moron would try to label a philosophy as a terrorist group.

[checks notes]

Yup, a moron.
I don't know if this is of any value, because I am not from the US, but signed!
Wow wow wow I thought sorting by controversial was risky in most threads but I never thought I'd see the day where people are  legitimately trying to argue that the KKK isn't a terrorist group. There's no hope for minorities in this country.
How the fuck did the Juggalos get classed as a threat but not the fucking KKK.
As a republican, it disgusts me that they haven't been labeled one sooner. Seeing country bumkins waving the confederate flag on their trucks every time I wander through through the country is cringe.
Donald Trump is a terrorist
So the Confederacy formed in the 1860s and no one gave a shit after it fell, but 100 years later during the civil rights movement they wanted to bring it back for heritage reasons.

Right....
They should and they should publish the names of all members of this or any domestic terrorist group. Name them so we can shame them, fire them, and ostracize them. All domestic terrorist groups are bad!
They should have been declared a terrorist group long ago. They have placed flaming crosses in the yards of black people, shot out windows or busted them with rocks, hung black people, marched through neighborhoods to put fear in people, etc. Why wouldn’t they be declared a terrorist group? It was fear that they were trying to strike in the heart of black people.
Wait, they arent?!
As many others in this comment has said ‘I’m not American, we already thought it was declared a terrorist group?!’ 

Wtf America. No wonder things are the way they are...
I’d sign that petition in a heart beat, in fact a lot of these groups should be considered terrorist.
They should be

This feels like a scandal, NOW we know why Trump didn't want to help out the Biden transition, he didn't do shit
There was no possible chance that Trump could have handled this crisis. He has no desire to learn anything, because he thinks he already knows everything. So when experts tried to inform him about the threat of the virus, [he tuned them out.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html).  Also, he’s not a problem-solver. When any problems came up in his life, he either had someone “fix” it or [ignored it](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2020/4/12/21218305/trump-ignored-coronavirus-warnings).  Unlike his business life as a private citizen, he had to do **something** about COVID eventually. However, because he has to take sole credit for anything, he’ll attack [anyone](http://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/10/19/fauci-trump-wearing-mask-weakness-430114) who gains attention for handling the virus.
So back in March/April 2020, when people were saying "he wants us to die" ... that wasn't hyperbole after all?
Since November, Donald Trump had everyone working to overturn an election that he lost. Thousands of Americans were dying every single day and he didn't care – nor did any of those around him – this includes Republicans in Congress.

They only worked to steal an election from the people who were dying. And the majority of Republicans in Congress voted against certifying Biden's victory.

Republicans are a death cult. Period. Americans are dying from a plague and Republicans are stealing all they can while throwing bodies on the fire.
[Over 400K Americans died under Trump's watch from covid](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/2021-01-19-covid-live-updates-vaccine-news-n1254624) and Trump didn't even have a fucking plan for vaccine distribution.  All he cared about was reversing the election and killing democracy in his final months.  Fuck that guy.
Since they say they "ran it like a buisness " shouldnt the trump administration be held to the same standards?? If your buisnesses negligence gets people killed, you are responsible both civilly and criminally. Lets roll out the charges.
[removed]
I believe I can pinpoint the actual time Trump gave up on COVID as April 23rd. That’s the day he held the press conference and instead of letting the experts speak, he wanted to be the smart one and talked about injecting disinfectant. After being skewered for his comments he stopped all effort.
Noticing a theme here.... We're going to discover quite often how things were much worse than we feared.
Saw that coming
My first sense was their plans were so bad as to be useless. I was wrong.  They had no plans.
This should surprise absolutely no one.  We are all fortunate to have some level of competence back in the federal government.
Homicide
I get the feeling as more is uncovered about the Trump administration you’re going to find out this (incompetence) will be a very common thread.
This is my shocked face.
The real tragedy is that, at the most inopportune time in history, Trump was in charge. The US is number ONE on the list for number of deaths from COVID and the US number is DOUBLE that of the next country on the list, Brazil.  But to hear Trump supporters tell it..."What more could Trump have done."  Well, stick around and see what impact a REAL president can have.
This is a serious scandal. Like other's have mentioned, the time wasted trying to frivolously fight the election results vs. serving the American people is just unforgivable. It's clear he knew this was going to be found out...

No one who is intelligent is surprised. 

Now, add that to the fact these people preferred infecting Americans from the begining? Jared Kushner?

These people should he in jail. Without question.

Trump's plan for everything is easy if you follow this one simple step.

1. How do I steal more money from Americans for myself.
In 2016, when the election was called for Trump, I tried to convey my feelings to my Trump supporting friends on Facebook.  Basically, I felt that there were going to be real consequences for electing an obviously unqualified and unfit man to that office.  And what I wanted to articulate is that somewhere, eventually, the consequences wouldn’t be abstract, they would hit every day Americans.  

I never ever assumed a pandemic would hit resulting in the sickness of millions of citizens and the deaths of hundreds of thousands.  My friend lost his father and his brother to COVID.  

In the sick way the world works, America’s timing for electing this clown couldn’t have been much worse.  To have this failure leading our response to the worst global pandemic in 100 years is something I will never be able to get passed.  It was a failure of Trump, but it started with a failure of the American voters.
I thought the army was gonna distribute

Trump had no plans, period.*
Everyone is blaming trump but this is on the entire GOP. They were really going to just kill us if he stayed in power. He cannot just walk away. People need to go to prison asap
I hear the plans are coming in 2 weeks...
Having a vaccine 8 months after a new dicease discovered is a technological wonder of an accomplishment.

No distribution plan and a whole... meh whatever approach is a scandal of unprecedented level when this is the difference between life and death for millions.

It's even worse than failing at distributing, its not even trying.

You mean to tell us the man who: seemed to take pride in refusing to plan anything, to "shoot from the hip" and hit himself in the bone spurs every time, and do everything he could to obstruct the government unless it directly added to his or good friends' bank accounts; that this man didn't pursue a means to stop thousands of people from dying every day?  Shocked! Shocked I say!
Trump literally didn’t govern whatsoever.  If anything his tenure is a testament to how the machine will still chug along when no one is at the wheel. He spent his days farting around watching TV, talking on the phone to rich sycophants, or playing golf. Not once did he write a speech, or stay up late weighing the pros and cons of a decision. He didn’t put together a healthcare plan or craft policies. He would do nothing, delegate decisions, shit himself, and rile up the millions of racist pieces of shit at rallies. That’s it. So it’s not surprising there wasn’t a vaccine distribution plan. 

He is a hated, hateful pile of garbage with an addled brain and will spend the rest of his days in ignominy and exile.

TLDR fuck Trump.

So....what the hell were those people doing? Looking at you Mike Pence, Alex Azar, et al. Just WTF were you doing for 10 months? If you needed help from an adult just raise your hand and admit that you are an unqualified partisan hack and quietly get out of the way of the experts. This is a brand new level of gross incompetence and there should be consequences.
Hold a preemptive state of the union and lay out everything they learned in the first week of the transition. We need to know exactly how on fire the house is. Transparency will be a gigantic breath of fresh air.
Not unexpected.. 

At least President Biden doesn't have any dumb shit to undo before making His own plan.
I just want an honest assessment of where the fuck we are.

Let us know what Trump left us with. For good or bad.
Pretty sure most of anyone who can critically think knew that already.
You're telling me the administration that had no plan ever for anything still had no plan? Imagine.
Imagine my surprise. 

C'mon. How would that have helped Trump get the election nullified?

I feel like this will be a common trope in the coming weeks.
I knew it. Like I told my pharmacist the other day when I asked her when they expect to get the vaccine in and she said 'probably March or April'.

Remember when Biden called Trump on how to handle the Pandemic, even though they were political rivals? Fuck. Trump. This is Goddamn criminal.
Step One: Pay money for vaccine

Step Two: Get Vaccine

Step Three:???

Step Four: Get Impeached
Trump only had plans for his wallet. Nothing else matters to him.
What about that Trapper Keeper Eric was always carrying around?

And the late ballot total does not offer a bridge to a win.

Game, set, match, ... Presidency to Joe Biden ... 46th President..
I was thinking this, what if the only reason Trump is insistent that Biden cheated was because Trump cheated. Like he couldn't have fathomed losing because he was cheating. His supporters said it was gonna be a 50 state landslide which is unthinkinable considering how much California and New York hate the ever loving shit out of Trump.
“THEY COULDN’T HAVE WON IT! We closed voting stations before Election Day, set up fake ballot boxes, AND disassembled a TON of mail sorting machines! They couldn’t have gotten past our schemes! They clearly cheated! We rigged the system a WHOLE LOT and they couldn’t have possibly gotten around that! The legal way was absolutely illegal!”
Yeah.  That was the threshold the media waited for to call Pennsylvania for Biden... That was on Saturday, I believe.
Heard someone in a Trump mask say "HE SHOULD'VE WON! HE DID WIN! I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!" to which her friends said "OH HE WILL WIN. IT'S NOT OVER BY A LONG SHOT! WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP PRAYING AND IT WILL HAPPEN!". I felt surprise, disbelief, fear, then embarrassment in the span of like 30 seconds. It was pretty wild.
 **This isn't news.** The lead of >0.5% in PA has been there for four days now.

Getting out of automatic recount territory in Pennsylvania was exactly the threshold major media outlets used to call the general election on Saturday.

EDIT: To those saying that the article's point is that it's no longer possible for an automatic recount to happen in PA based on Biden's lead: 1) No, it doesn't make that point, and 2) that point wouldn't be valid anyway.

1) The statements in the article concerning what has changed between Saturday and now are unrelated to having passed the threshold where an automatic recount would be impossible when all votes are counted. The article says, "Theoretically, the number could shrink with more tallying underway, but Biden's lead is expected to continue going up," which was already true on Saturday, and "Biden is now up by 50,000 votes, which means that even if Trump's legal team is successful in getting courts to toss out 10,000 votes received between Election Day and Nov. 6, there's little chance they could actually alter the results," which doesn't pertain to the notion of an automatic recount.

2) The [NYT data scraper](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#) estimates that there are 32,000 votes left to be counted in Pennsylvania. Biden's win margin is currently about 51,000 votes. If all the remaining votes went to Trump, Trump would trail by 19,000 votes, or about 0.3% of the total, which would trigger an automatic recount. Trump hasn't passed any new threshold in relation to recounts.
I imagine they'll never get rid of trump. Biden will move in and trump will just live in the walls. Scurrying from room to room, eating scraps and raiding the fridge in the middle of the night.

He'll be there for decades, president after president.

Inevitably someone will get too close and get bit, contracting covid19.
Uhoh looks like Trump is going to have to beg for more money to pay for a recount if he wants one
I'm a republican but I hope they do a recount to show everyone we lost. Like....its not a conspiracy we lost. We can try again in 4 more years. With someone else because Trump is horrible.
Thank god. It’s finally over. 70 days to go until inauguration

Edit: it’s not over apparently
Can we all give a big thanks to whoever owns [loser.com](https://loser.com)?  I mean fitting.  Seriously fitting.
Make sure Trump puts up the cash, don't let him write another IOU he never intends to pay.
Every. Single. Day. This week NPR has had a republican asshole on every hour on the hour, a governor, congressman, or senator and each one of them is asked if they think it’s time Trump concede. Across the board they all say the same stupid bullshit:

1. Trump shouldn’t concede until the process goes through the courts.

2. They always mention Al Gore as if it’s remotely the same scenario.

3. They each say that cases of fraud need to be investigated but when asked for proof of fraud they deflect. 

What a bunch of spineless ass kissing yes men. I have never been more ashamed of my country in all my life. If Democrats try and play ball with these asshats instead of going scorched earth I’m done voting for them.

Game over. Just kidding, the game was over a few days ago. However, it seems there are some sore losers on the "fuck your feelings" side.
Meanwhile Trump just tweeted "WE WILL WIN!" along with some video talking about doing the impossible.  This is some Fuerherbunker level shit.
[removed]
Landslide victory. Huge. Best landslide huge victory now. Confefe. Huge. Tim Apple.
The scenes on conservative sub. Appalling views all coming out.

Utter denial, disrespect towards the mandate
Fuck it. Recount every state. I want to watch the orange shithead lose twice.
Once the pandemic is over, I see no reason not to keep allowances for widespread mail-in voting in place. 

If you subtract out Republicans' deliberate sabotage of the post office and their intentional roadblocks to efficient counting, it went incredibly well. I'm actually proud of the country for how well it did with this rollout.

The success of mail-in voting is part of the reason Republicans are lying to the American people about voter fraud and why people like Graham are calling to curtail mail-in voting.

So many of their GOP's favorite voter suppression efforts work only with in person voting (long lines, physical intimidation, faulty software, insecure voting machines, voter ID, restricted polling places). 

Vote by mail allowed people to bypass so much of it and they are furious.
He’s gonna try to do it anyway. Trump is the most pathetic sore loser I’ve ever seen.
It's been at .7 for over 2 days now actually.
[deleted]
Biden is up by 52k in PA now, and whereas a few days ago I was pretty resigned to the fact that he was going to lose AZ, it’s now looking like he may actually win it by a couple thousand votes. And GA seems to be a lock. 306 and 5 million vote lead in the popular vote. Solid victory. Any Trump supporter who is still whining about a “rigged election” needs to stfu and come back to reality.
Lmao trump got beat by sleepy joe. I listened to Biden give a few speeches and even at his old age he makes so much sense than trump
And thats super ball game.
[removed]
Because he won.

Lil Donnie needs to start packing his bags.
Biden won. Fuck your feelings.
Next top move from Trump is to legally change his name in Joe Biden, this way he won.
I'm in Queen Creek AZ, aka Trump country. They have increased the number of flags and have not given up. Asked if we expected them to shut up, give up, and comply, to which I reply, "Yes. And, we're going to enjoy it thoroughly."

I find myself in conversations with people here often. I tell them my political affiliation is to be objective and follow the facts/science/money. Sometimes they'll play along. Most of the time, they repeat the exact rhetoric going around. It's almost like the same conversation. So, I like to point that out too. Now, I'll just tell them to please excuse me while I tell myself all the talking points they're about to say. Leaves them speechless.

Not sure why I rambled all that. We all probably need to get this off our chests. I think it has a lot to do with how many friends and family are infected. Really scarey. And sad.
The number of my coworkers that think Trump winning N.C. and Alaska means their electoral votes get taken OFF Biden's total, putting him back under 270 and placing Trump in the lead (somehow) because they read it on Facebook is staggering. 

These are guys who voted for Trump twice (TWICE) because he's "an outsider, gonna clean up Washington".
[deleted]
Go ahead and recount them just to humiliate trump.
The race is over. Trump just being a petulant child by not conceding.
PA counters have received death threats. It's pathetic how far these people will go to try to steal an election.
"what do you mean the president's credit isn't good here"
Fine print says that 50% of donations will he used to pay off camapign debt
Now the Trump campaign can pay out of pocket for a recount that will definitively prove that he lost the state. This little charade to pay off his debts is going to backfire when he doesn't even manage to break even...
Should we start sending Trump boxes full of straws for him to grasp at?
>Biden's Pennsylvania lead WAS ALWAYS big enough to avoid an automatic recount


FTFY.

If they had counted mail in ballots as they came in instead of starting on election night, it would have never even appeared close.
From the UK, sending my love to Pennsylvania. Having that mad man on the world stage was horrifying. Thanks for helping dump Trump. Wish I could buy you all a beer.
Honestly, Joe just has one of the cutest smiles ever. Lights up my day every time!

Has anyone else noticed that Trump supporters act like cult members?
And it's going to continue to get bigger. I kept telling people we had PA on lockdown. We learned our lessons from last time.
Is Trump scrutinizing the votes of states that he won the same way he is scrutinizing states that he lost?
Trump needs to accept it already
[deleted]
“Yea but project veritas and Qanon told me that recounts are conspiracy theories so what is a recount? it’s a democrat hoax. Nobody has ever even heard of numbers. And before you ask it’s all on YouTube, no I’m not going to link it. Do your own research fascist sheep.”- MAGA cult
They can recount it 100 times and republicans will still say it was rigged
Them: “it isn’t over till it’s over”

PA: “it’s over”
Trump only needs 134% of the vote to catch him.
Trump lost bigly.
Then we are done.  Biden is the next president.  Election is over.  Recounts won't matter.
I was in Pittsburgh 3 weeks ago.

The number of Biden signs was glorious. Hundreds . Versus I saw 3 Trump signs
A post it note.....a lawyer brought in a post it note as evidence.

Put all of the Trump supporters in kentucky...

Build a wall asap
Just funny how Hillary lost by fewer than 80,000 votes total in a handful of swing states and didn’t go to the courts or demand recounts nearly as loudly as trump has, who’s been beaten more soundly
Run that shit up. 80k plus lead baby
Good. Then the other states projected for Biden are symbolic. Trump is a treasonous traitor for delaying the democratic process any further.
[deleted]
if the trump team wants a recount they should be required to pay all wages for the staff doing the recount as well as any other costs that go with it.
Trump has no class, character, or integrity. He is wasting everyone's time, especially the folks who have to recount the votes. And he is insulting everyone else at the same time.
Well we know Dump won’t pay for a recount. Bye Dump.
I have one coworker that is deep into the trump cult and every day he is more and more convinced that this was all trumps idea and that it’s “ a large chess game” like get the fuck over it Biden won .
And if Biden's Arizona lead stays above 0.1%, he'll avoid a recount there as well.
the "billionaire" is going to fundraise to pay for a recount anyway to slow walk it

meanwhile in georgia they are making taxpayers pay for a HAND recount which will only change things by maybe a few hundred votes at best but would be funny if they were towards Biden

anyway this is the least of our problems now, even covid might pale to what is going on in the pentagon that people still aren't noticing
I’m sure they’ll waste more of everyone’s time trying though.  Smh.
Yay!  Fuck Trump!
As of 11/11/2020 21:00 hours, Biden has over 77 million votes to Trumps 72 million. Almost double the count of what Hillary had in 2016 over Trump. It looks like all of America did come out to vote, and democracy won!

&#x200B;

yes, I'm drunk and I just had amazing sex.
Nobody is asking if there was unfair play on the republican side. 

Their surge, almost matching numbers. 


They pushed hard to split voting. 
Most democrat votes were postal. 
Most republican votes in person. 
Disrupt postal operations to begin with. 
Install your crony to run the postal service. 

Postal service can report numbers of mail in votes because they scan every piece of mail now. 

Republicans know roughly how many votes they need to match/beat democrat showing in postal votes. 

But it didn’t quite work. 

Explains their sheer outrage and disbelief in the result. They thought they had it.
By this point the election for Trump is lost unless he can somehow claim Pennsylvania AND Georgia AND Nevada, all three at the same time.

How tf are people even donating money to the recount cause at all
The White House Gift Shop is selling Joe Biden/Kamala Harris inaugural coins.
This amuses me 

https://politicalwire.com/2020/11/11/trump-may-want-to-visit-the-white-house-gift-shop/
With ga delay tactics..will that matter anyway?

As long as biden crosses 270 they will go ahead with the process?
Shoutout to Pennsylvania😎🇺🇸!
Can we just take the time to appreciate that a Republican governor put it in place that they couldn’t touch the ballots until Election Day because they didn’t want to unfairly influence voters ahead of Election Day. They could very well have had another 2016 where Dems stayed home because they figured Biden won.
I've heard Republicans say that we shouldn't do away with the electoral college because California and New York have too many people and would be too powerful.  Biden's victory is so decisive that he almost doesn't need those states at all.

As of 1pm today, Biden has a 5,071,789 vote lead across the nation.  If you threw out every vote in California, Biden would still the popular vote.  The same is true in the state of New York.  If you threw out all votes in both states, Trump would win the popular vote, but only by about 680,000 votes.  If you threw out all of the votes in the 5 boroughs of New York City and the votes in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Francisco County, and Alameda County, then Biden would still win the popular vote by 1.4 million votes.
Unfortunately no amount of factual evidence will be enough for some people.


But, ya know... _we’re_ the snowflakes 🙄
Look at the Trump supporters foaming at the mouth — hilarious 🤣

I was hoping something like this was going to happen to Trump.  He throws a big enough tantrum, and finally getting his recount, only to still be a loser.

There is a small part of me that wanted to see him refuse to leave and watch him dragged out throwing a tantrum. 

But I am relieved he's out all the same.
Goodbye Mr. Trump. May your business ventures fail, crimes be held to account and your name be associated only with your shameful legacy.
I hope he gets cuffed the moment he lands in Florida.
What's  the expression? Good riddance to bad rubbish !
The battle is over, but the war isn't won yet. Goodbye Donald, you mother fucker.
So glad this fucking asshat wont be in the news every single day
Get the fuck outta here. What a fucking loser.  Biggest loser.  Huge.  Really folks.  A lot of people are saying the biggest loser in America.  Maybe ever.
It’s like Christmas!
And thus flies Donny Treason into the dust bin of history
This fuck says he put Biden in a great spot and if things recover it's because of him. Go fuck off forever Trump, you've left this country in a horrendously worse place than four years ago.
The pendulum has stopped swinging the wrong direction. It's fitting that today is a palindrome

Now we swing the other direction
Out with a whimper. A pathetic exit for the most pathetic president.
I know we're only 20 days in, but it's going to be hard to top this for best headline of 2021.
Good. Fucking. Riddance. To. This. Entire. Administration. 🙌🏻

I've aged in dog years for these past 4 years.
Congratulations America on finally ridding yourselves of that fucking loser. Fuck you, Trump.
Change the locks.
let the sanitization begin!
Ding dong the witch is dead ...
On to the next:

- Convict him in the Senate
- Pursue other charges, both Federal and State, against him and his cronies from the vast pile of transgressions
- MAKE SURE THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA BANS REMAIN PERMANENT

What a long, awful nightmare. 
Never again, America.
Damn. He left quietly. I wanted to see a livestream of him kicking and screaming like the little toddler he is.

Sone of a...

Oh well.

EDIT: I mean him specifically. I was dreaming of NatGuard and Police walking up to the Whitehouse with cuffs and weapons at hand ready to remove him from the whitehouse as he is kicking and screaming.

It would have been so nice to see.
So now that there will be significantly less bullshit coming out of washington I suddenly feel like I have a lot of time on my hands.  Anyone have any recommendations for hobbies?
Watching it now, goodbye American Carnage..
Never say never. 

I absolutely would not put it past congress to somehow fumble making him ineligible to hold office again, the executive branch to manage not to convict him of any felonies and him to somehow be reelected in 4 or 8 years.

We can still managed to screw this up and have the cheeto in chief again.
This feels oddly familiar. 

A Democratic President inheriting a country in crisis from a Republican President.
Next is to take away his post-presidency benefits.
Super Callous Fragile Racist Sexist Nazi ~~POTUS~~

Hip Hip...
And stay out!
Anyone else suddenly feel like they they can breathe again for the first time in 4 years?
Good riddance.
Such a joy to watch him leave for the last time. Fuck you Cheeto Mussolini. Fuck you for all the evil you wrought on this country. We'll see you in court where I'll relish watching you squirm as you face the consequences of your actions.
Today I will meditate, listen to good music, cook a good meal or get take out barbeque, get junk off my desk, wash clothes, clean house, take the dog for a walk, hug the people in my house, take a long hot shower, go for a drive, start on all the stuff I've been putting off because I just couldn't deal with it right now, and do some art. Life goes on. Just a little easier.
This is the kind of headline I like waking up to.
And don’t you come back no more.
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya Bish!
Did he really get a helicopter?

They should have made his dumb ass walk
His exit playlist sounded like a high school pep rally. He left with as little dignity as he entered with. Good riddance.
Melania was actually smiling before they got on Marine One. So excited to file those divorce papers.
I get a COVID vaccine and a new president today!  Everything is coming up Millhouse!
Good fuck’n riddance
What a fucking joke of a presidency.
Truly the end of an error.
Change the fucking locks you guys
That nightmare is finally over.
I woke up, hours ahead of schedule, to see this happening. It's slight, and brief, but it's truly waking up in a better world.
 He promised that the economy will record “incredible numbers” after he leaves office, and urged his supporters to “remember us” if there is a dramatic recovery under President-elect Biden.   


So, just to be clear, if we have a downturn, this is another broken promise from Trump and we can blame that on him too? Is he dense?? Oh wait... wait...never mind.
> He promised that the economy will record “incredible numbers” after he leaves office, 

Already trying to take credit for Biden's successes
I seriously got goosebumps watching Marine One fly away with him for the last time, I really couldn't help but smile. You love to see it!
Thank you God!!!! Now smite him
I greatly enjoyed watching air force one fly away to the dying strains of ‘my way’. It truly is a great weight off to have him gone, can’t wait for (fingers crossed) many many consequences falling on his and his family’s heads going forward!
We survived.
These four years have been the longest decade of my life.
I know Trump has Scottish roots, so I speak for Scotland when I say:

*We Don’t Claim Him.*
Good riddance. Traitor.
His face is so orange today it looks like he spent the morning bobbing for Cheetos.
“I will be watching. I will be listening....We will see you soon.” 

This guy doesn’t realize he is the villain of the movie. He’s Freddie Krueger threatening to reappear again. 

Until then, good riddance.
Na na na na

Na na na na

Oh, Hell yeah!

Goodbye!
 Donald Trump Has Just Left the White House—This Time, for *the* Good *of the Nation.*

FIFY
I started uncontrollably ugly-crying/laughing watching the video of him and Melania leaving. Its like, I feel absolutely shell shocked after the last four years. What the fuck was any of that?!
Did they film him as he rode away crying just like they did all of the people who were fired on The Apprentice?
I legit did not think I was going to survive the Trump presidency.  I intend to hold Biden’s feet to the fire and demand a lot, but it just hasn’t set in yet that it’s gonna be better.  I’m so used to just dreading waking up and looking at the news to see the new travesty.
\*Toilet flushing sound\*
>for good

This has a double meaning in this case
Ok, it’s official now: Not my President!! 🎇🎉🥳
Classless when he campaigned. Classless when he won. Classless when he arrived, and classless when he left.

At least I guess he was consistent.
Fuck Trump and fuck Republicans
Man, I was really hoping to tweet "You're fired" to him today, but him not having twitter at all is good enough. 

Still though...

Trump, you're fired.
That was a pretty shitty episode of The Apprentice
Apparently as T**** was leaving the White House, a microphone picked up "Good riddance to that old dump."

I didn't even know buildings could talk.

This shows how important it is to vote in your local races. A narrative well worth pushing in it's own right.
>**"We need to make Election Day a holiday," Northam had said in his State of the Commonwealth speech earlier this year.**  
>  
>**"We can do it by ending the Lee-Jackson holiday that Virginia holds ... It commemorates a lost cause. It's time to move on."**

Agreed. I don't care if it's part of a racist "heritage and culture" they are always talking about.
Why is Election Day not a national holiday?? Oh right, because voter suppression.
Virgina is on a roll these days, thanks to all the voters who came out and made a difference.
Conservative Virginians are losing their damn minds right now. They hate Northam with a passion. It’s almost funny to see themselves getting all worked up on my local county FB page (almost, after reading a few it’s just fucking depressing how insane these people are). They’re all in on their conspiracy theories, and claiming that Northam is taking advantage of the pandemic crisis to get his “liberal, baby killing agenda” passed. The very same pandemic crisis that they denounced and called a hoax and fake news when Northam called for a state wide stay at home order.
Amazing what happens when you vote out all the Republicans. Protection of voting rights? Not making people go to the polls in PPE? You paying attention Wisconsin voters.. you can have all these rights too...
This guy is not fucking around. 


He should write a guide after this titled “how to unfuck your state in one term.
Also removed the requirement that voters show a photo ID prior to casting a ballot. 

>	"Voting is a fundamental right, and these new laws strengthen our democracy by making it easier to cast a ballot, not harder," Northam said in a statement. "No matter who you are or where you live in Virginia, your voice deserves to be heard. I'm proud to sign these bills into law."

We need more states doing this.
> "We can do it by ending the Lee-Jackson holiday that Virginia holds ... It commemorates a lost cause. It's time to move on."

Confederates were traitors.  They fought against the United States.  Against.  That fact isn't even debatable.  Confederates waged a war against the United States.
It’s been an awesome week to be a Virginian. We got expanded abortion rights, decriminalized cannabis, and now this. For a state that was red not too long ago, I’m proud of us. Please remember how truly important your local elections are. Fuck the president, I know the choices are both terrible. I’m still voting against Trump but I understand why people don’t want to participate. But there’s no reason to not vote in local elections. It helps so much, even if the progression is slow.
If Joe Biden gets elected and Democrats take the Senate, I want an all out Leftward legislative and judicial blitzkrieg like Virginia is having right now

I want McConnel to turn over in his shell and just struggle helplessly on his back
Virginia’s Blue Wave just keeps on giving.
Whenever someone tries to tell you both sides are the same, this is one of the examples you point to. You have one party trying to get as many people voting as possible while a cornerstone for the other party is voter suppression through myriad ways. And then between those two parties, one is trying to secure our elections through legislation while the other party fights against this legislation, actually invites foreign interference in our elections and very actively suppresses investigations and notifications to the public of acts of interference that have occurred. They cannot, in good faith, continue to argue that both sides are the same
[removed]
Open and fair elections? RIP GOP!
Support the United States Postal Service! It is being threatened right now.
[removed]
This should be nationwide
I keep thinking these are the onion posts.  Virginia is absolutely crushing it lately.
The majority of Americans want this. It's stupid that this is not the case in every single state.
This is how voting changes not from an executive order or federal action but at the state level. Change happens from the ground up, not top down.
Watch, the GOP will make up some bullshit about how giving people the day off to vote would hurt the economy or some shit like that.
Who's next? 

How quickly will there be 50 state voting holidays?

Bets that there won't be 50 and all states where Election Day is not a holiday are Trump states and gerrymander GOP states, or that the these are the last to enact holidays if there are 50?
Hey "Never Bidens", are you paying attention? 

Help elect Biden and flip the Senate and shit can get done and Liberal  and competent Judges will be confirmed.
Wait for it ladies and gentlemen, the Republican onslaught of “expanding early voting and making an election isn’t fair.... it’s not how we’ve done things before and why are we changing our great nations traditions?!” Ugh
This election is about more than Medicare for All.

Small changes is better than no change.

Vote Blue, folks.
This should happen throughout the country but nope the gop is too damn scared of it.
Man, Virginia is on a fucking roll as of late.  A glimmer of what could be, but probably won't.
A governor doing his civic duty is such a rarity these days.
Virginia is blue, baby! Great work everyone who helped get here!
The way to one-up disenfranchisement. Make voting convenient.
How positively un-American.


I hope others follow suit.
The reason why Virginia has been on such a fucking roll this year is that in November we finally took control of both chambers of our legislature for the first time in like 20 years. State and local elections matter so fucking much guys, please vote and get everyone you can to vote.
After 25 years of republican bullshit, Virginia's on a real liberal bender...

LGBTQ rights, voting rights, abortion rights, restricting gun ownership.

Good for them.
[deleted]
Wow. So a more Americans can have the opportunity to vote??

How unamerican....
Making voting difficult is what totalitarian criminals do. Why isn't every Dem governor making election days state holidays?
Good riddance.
Virginian born and raised. Live here my whole life and I can't wait for this whole legacy of the south to crumble.

I hope all the monuments to generals and Davis and others are torn down or moved to the battlefields.
I've lived around Richmond for most of my life and often visit the battlefields. They are nice for walks and reflection. The history and meaning of those places, the death, struggle, pain, suffering, commradery, and sorrow is something that every American should experience. But I am often disappointed in my fellow countrymen that the fields and woods are often empty, long forgotten and discarded. Sacrifices made and blood spilled not honor, not mourned, not remembered.

But what is always at the forefront of people's mind, the "history," is those stupid fucking statues on monument avenue. Those great leaders up on their horses. Those same men that sold lies to my ignorant ancestors, who were denied schooling, reading, writing, voting, and instead were told to work the land for mere penitence of their worth. They used them as cannon fodder and told them lies about the Yankees coming for their rights. Those men should be torn down or moved to the battlefields. Maybe then people would go and see and feel and hear those battles of brothers against one another. 

But, I think not unfortunately.
They are really just buying into the old story of lost cause and the grand old south. Much like my family has done. Even with the knowledge that the landed gentry class manipulated  our ancestors to fight a battle that would continue to hold them down, they still believe in "states rights" , "war of nothern agression"  and whatever other crap they call it.
My family has been dirt floor poor white trash for ever until the last 50 years when we made it to the middle class and they still want to celebrate those men that help keep us down for so long. I hang my head in shame, but I celebrate these new laws that will tear down this legacy that has put a stain on the south.
Republicans: Noooo you can't making voting easier!
And with that, Virginia's elections just became more free.

And Virginia turns blue.
I’m from Virginia and this makes me proud!!!
Wow that seems like a really fucking common sense idea
Every other state needs to ducking do this
And Trump will burn him on Twitter
Virginia has been killing it lately. I wish Georgia wasn't run by a fucking moron.
Yo is it me or is Virginia kinda winning lately? Bravo well done from a Californian. Looking forward to the rest of the states to follow suit!
Remember when people reasonably wanted him to resign because he wore blackface in his college yearbook? And then he didn't, kind of like a Republican. Well, it was a probably net positive to eat a little shit. Remember that when certain posters are shitting on Biden for being imperfect.
This is what happens when you flip a state Blue.
"What is best in life, governor?"

"It is to drive my Republican enemies before me and hear der wailing of der pundits."
Fair and accessible voting is how the GOP dies. And they know it.
This guy protected election day, abortion rights and admonished Confederate "heroes" all in the same day. Damn.
It SHOULD be a national holiday. We already get an extra day every election year so nothing is being lost.
Nice work, Virginia!! Keep this up, America, and you'll become a democracy!
He also signed legislation decriminalizing marijuana and paving the path to legalization by 2022! Great time to be a Virginian.
Donald Trump is a criminal.
Congrats on Virginia!
This guy is just killing it. I wish all of our leaders were like him.
This should've been in place a long time ago, but, at least in this case, it's better late than never!
These need to be more than holidays.  They need to be quarantine level of essential personnel only holidays.  Give people nothing to do but go vote.  If we can do it for two months then we can do it for one day every 2 years.  But good on Virginia for at least going this far.  I moved to NC from there and I just hope we do it down here, too.
Using his brain noodle. Nice. Thanks, Virginia.
Crazy idea but we should be doing everything in our power to make sure as many Americans as possible vote.
Wait till the Republicans try and kill the USPS. They love them some voter suppression.
Is this the Democrat version of putting in, "the fix?"  


Not that this isn't awesome - it's incredible. And it probably hamstrings the GOP's efforts in Virginia for good, as well.
Grrr Republicans MAD! “DONT LET PEOPLE VOTE THEN WE LOSE “
I couldn't give a fuck about which side is doing what, but this is solid, pro-democracy change. Enfranchising as many of your citizens as possible to vote is at the core of a strong democracy.  


\*Clap\* - Well down Virginia.
I'm very happy for them until the supreme court tells them it's illegal somehow.
It should come as no surprise that Northam is a Democrat.
Can someone tell me the conservative viewpoint on why this is a bad thing? 

Do they not want americans exercising their rights?
This is awesome and I think every statewide election should be a holiday as well as possibly getting rid of Columbus Day and replacing it with a national holiday on federal elections.
Man what is up with Virginia of all places leading the charge lately?  I’ve seen tons of stuff in the last 6 mos that was progressive, sound governance.
Excellent work. The fact that election day is not already a national holiday makes zero goddamned sense. I say this as someone who leans republican - Id rather lose an honest election than “win” one where people can barely afford to show up, if they show up at all. Would love to see mail in and online voting expand too. An engaged citizenry is crucial for the success of any democracy.

Virginia has been killing it lately.
I really want to see a reporter asking Trump about this. I really want to hear his response.
Despite his flaws, he’s made me proud of my state.
Trump to Virginia governor. "Nice state ya got here, be a shame if something were to happen to it".
I seriously never, in my wildest dreams, could’ve possibly imagined that Virginia would be a bastion of progressive policy. This is, indeed, bizzaro land.
Conservatives will run on repealing this mark my words
Honestly I don’t see why it isn’t a National Holiday or at least allow mail in voting.
Election day shouldn't be a holiday, because voting should not take place on a single day. We should have a voting *week* to give people ample time to vote AND have voting by mail an option alongside it.
Meanwhile here in Wisconsin we try killing you if you dare to vote.
Here in Brazil all elections happen on Sundays, people that work that day get some free time and essential workers like police officers and firefighters are allowed to cut the line.

And drinking is prohibited because we’re supposed to vote in our right minds.
This man is a God damned stud.
Viginia has been on fire lately
WOW!  Props to you for working towards a better democracy!  Hope other governors fall in suit!
The Virginia GOP has 0% chance of ever winning another election.
Yesterday they pass that awesome trans/gay rights bill and now this? Virginia throwing down the gauntlet lately. I love it.
Sounds good to me, make it a national holiday. No reason this can't be a bipartisan effort.
Where all my fellow Virginians at? Holla!
Just 49 states to go
Ah Virginia, the North of the South.
Finally. If only the federal government would just make it a federal holiday across the board. Unfortunately, our esteemed president doesn’t want to make it easier to vote. Easier to get guns and ammo, but harder to vote. Makes total sense.
Every state should do this
Republicans hate this one weird trick...
I'm so glad he didn't listen to the idiots who said he should resign over blackface. People who are more interested in the *appearance* of being woke than actually making the world a better place. Performative wokeness is a scourge.
Know how I know the governor of Virginia isn't a republican...?
It has to kinda suck to be a republican trying to explain why this is bad besides "when everyone can vote republicans lose". Though I'm sure the fox and oan propaganda mills are churning something as we speak.
National Election day should be a public holiday. That way if mail in voting isnt an option you can go stand in line and vote. Get rid of Columbus Day maybe. It's not like Columbus actually discovered anything. Why celebrate that idiot.
have republicans started suing yet?
VERY proud Virginian that sat in 2hrs of traffic during rush hour (which is terrible here) to vote here. <3 this week has been amazing despite all the chaos in the world.
49 other governors, your fucking turn!
About time!
