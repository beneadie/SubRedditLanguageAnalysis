Upvote the Net Neutrality Megathread as much as we down voted EA.
I don't post too often so I hope I did this right. I usually just lurk around and here lately it's all been people bashing EA (deservedly). I don't game really anymore but they want to charge us more for gaming, Reddit, Google, ECT. Fuck that shit. So go to r/Videos and check it out.

Edit: Just saw a post similar to this on the thread. Sorry u/Davidjhyatt, didn't check before I posted.

Upvote but PLEASE call the representatives! That site really makes things easier!
It's EA's lucky day. Someone's being more evil than they are.
As people living in a foreign country (Mexico in my case), is there anything we can do to help?
Upvoting on Reddit isn't going to stop corporate paid shills at the FCC from selling us out to their sponsors.

What's next, we going to pray it away?

Front page is filled with this shit, so it must be working lol
WE CAN STILL FIGHT!! White house petition for Net Neutrality!!!

https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality
Every single post I see on the front page (and about 4 pages deep into /r/all) is a link to battleforthenet.com or something else about net neutrality

I think that this has been achieved. If not all focused on one post, then for sure spread across the hundreds of posts about this subject on reddit over the past 24 hours. 
The thing is, EA and lootboxes affected the whole world. Basically anyone who plays videogames.

This net neutrality spam only affects the US.
We all dead now
This feels like a weird "Berniesque" attempt to save something when we all know it's just gonna be some stupid miserable thing that we get at the end.
Anyone have a direct link?
Fuck Nassau county leadership for having their phones turned off and mailboxes full
#TOTALLY GRASSROOTS 
honestly at this point it's much more than the EA thing lolol
I feel you guys. Would help out but since I don't live in America for the matter I'm not even American. But I really hope you guys win this. 
For all non Americans who want to help I’ve been directed to this URL:

Upvoting on Reddit, calling Congressmen's voicemail isn't going to achieve shit. Money talks. Reddit needs to come together and bribe Ajit Pai more than what Verizon is bribing him and ask him to restore Net Neutrality forever.
WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE A LAZY REDDITOR WHO TRIES TO HELP WITH JUST UPVOTES:

Here are 2 petitions to sign, one international and one exclusively US.

International: https://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home

US: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality

Text "resist" to 504-09. It's a bot that will send a formal email, fax, and letter to your representatives. It also finds your representatives for you. All you have to do is text it and it holds your hand the whole way.

WAY too many people are simply upvoting and hoping that'll be enough, this is the closest level of convenience to upvoting you can find WHILE actually making a difference.

This effects us all. DO. YOUR. PART.

These are the emails of the 5 people on the FCC roster. These are the five people deciding the future of the internet.

Not so crazy idea: If the FCC kills Net Neutrality, Twitter should then delete President Trump's account.
Strike now. Do not hesitate, show no mercy.
just pose as an fcc supporter, it’ll get even more downvotes
Where do I sign up?
That's not a crazy idea.
So if you haven't already, there's a bot you can text, that helps you write an email or a fax, free of charge, to your senator, or governor. Text "resist" to "504-09" and it'll ask you some questions, then you're onto writing. From another thread a few weeks ago, someone posted this message, and it think it's a great one to send.

"Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.

Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture.

Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all."

I'd love to credit the user, but have lost the comment, but please, go send some faxes, show your politicians you want net neutrality to stay.
In order to save the internet, one of these 3 men have to change their mind and vote in favor of net neutrality. Tweet at them directly and let them know what you think:

The three men plan to vote to repeal net neutrality. The two women plan to vote to keep net neutrality.
To defeat the net neutrality repeal, one of those three men has to change their vote. Pass it on!
[Here is a White House petition to save net neutrality](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality)
Upvoted! Hope it helps! Would hate to see the internet become even less free.
This will never happen. People love to hate and feel superior to things, and that EA nonsense was a rare righteous indignation circle jerk.
ISPs dont have to follow this, or? So you could pick an ISP that doesnt discriminate against indy sites
No
What will it accomplish?
I hope net neutrality gets destroyed just because of how it took over the front page of all. Seriously, we get it, and not everyone is American or cares 
Something doesn't smell right...

First false information in a formula:

"these big companies support net neutrality, so it's bad", then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN.

https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/

VERIZON, ATT, COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN.

There is a reason. You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.

There is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.
Yeah, upvotes, that'll show them
I've got a better idea, let's invite this Ajit Pai character for an AMA and then we all downvote him into oblivion, which as we all know is how real change is affected on the inner'net.
What if..... we all called a congressman of the opposite party we like and tell them that we will consider reevaluating our opinion of the party if they help keep net neutrality alive? Democratic redditors call Republican politicians. Republican redditors call Democratic politicians. We all send the same message: We want sane politicians and their votes are indicators.
The Trump administration wants to kill the open internet as we know it, and create paid fast lanes for content. This is completely against the idea of the free exchange of information, and will put the US in line with countries like China who control the dissemination of information to the public.
[battleforthenet.com](http://www.battleforthenet.com) has created an easy way to make your voice heard. 

**Text "resist" to 504-09.** It will draft and fax a custom letter to your local representative. It doesn't get any simpler than this.
It will ask you a few questions that you will need to answer to make the letter valid, and it will even send you a copy of the letter for your records. I wrote something to the effect of this: "Net neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the internet. Control over the internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. Please stand with the public by protecting net neutrality once and for all. I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan."

Or even better, call your member of congress and let them know what you think: **Please call: 424-363-4877**.

You will be connected to the offices of your lawmakers -- just introduce yourself, be polite, and say:

"I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan."
Please text "Resist" to 504-09. Resistbot will contact all your officials (House, Senate, Governor)for you with your message and confirm delivery.
If you would like to, you can use the below to send to your representatives.

"The open internet allows people of all nationalities, religions and beliefs to bypass traditional media gatekeepers and access a wealth of knowledge and community otherwise none existent in today's world. Without Net Neutrality, ISPs can and will limit and/or block speech, the pursuit of knowledge and self-betterment. Without Net Neutrality, people of all nationalities, religions and beliefs would lose a vital platform that should be a right in this modern time. If America truly wants to put its citizens first then its government should not allow the perversion of net neutrality. Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all."

We could just recreate the internet if it really comes down to it, and instead of having large servers and instead of ISP’s controlling the web, it could be run by the users. Just food for thought. Also, let me know if I’m out of the loop and there is something like this.

Since you started it, I'll bite. Would you rather a multitude of competing private entities have the ability to play favorites with internet traffic, but a massive financial incentive NOT to do so, or would you rather the federal government, with no competition, to have that same ability, but with a massive financial and political incentive TO do so? https://youtu.be/0cLWgTIsMLM

PornHub should create a second website, TheHub, for all nonporn material and become a YouTube competitor.


Edit:

As user u/Atleastotried pm'd me, they had almost this identical idea two days ago! As I said in a comment below, my idea was inspired by a Facebook discussion regarding YouTube and child abusers; but the world's a crazy place and it doesn't take much for two random people to come to similar conclusions. See u/Atleastotried s comments here-

[deleted]
/u/Katie_Pornhub might be able to pass the message along.
At this point I just want any real company to become a YouTube competitor.

Be it PornHub, Amazon, or McDonalds, just for the love of god someone present some real competition to the Catastorphic Flaming Pile of Garbage known as "Youtube"
In the year 2100, the largest corporation in the world is HubCorp. It's largest divisions include PharmHub, NanoHub, OilHub, SteelHub, PornHub, SuperHub, EliteHub, TheHub, MSNHub (joint venture with Microsoft Corporation), and SpaceHub.
The first viable YouTube competitor wins in my opinion.  I would love to never YouTube again.
NormHub
That’s a great idea since I heard a bunch of gun channels decided to move to pornhub because of new policies over at YouTube 
[deleted]
The problem is, PornHub has a lot more content freedom because all of their ads are 'mature', so the ad providers don't care as much about the actual videos. A company trying to sell me dick pills doesn't care if they're advertised next to a gun video. If they wanted a more 'family friendly' site, then they'd probably have to get ads from the same pool as YouTube, and the cycle would just continue. 
Wasn't TheHub the name for a children's television network? My Little Pony used to/may still air on it.
That'd be good for literally everyone. YouTube wouldn't stand a chance if some of the big content creators moved over to it. Especially since they wouldn't get demonetized randomly 
People keep saying this, but how would it ever catch on? Just the association with porn would stop a huge amount of their potential market from using it
The internet needs this so bad.
"When you're done with your rub-a-dub-dub, make sure to stop by The Hub!"
I get the popularity for this meme - especially in the wake of recent issues with YouTube. Yet I would like to point out that the entire business model of Youtube and PornHub is ad-revenue based and *something* tells me there's a pretty big divide between the advertisers of both.

Even if the site was an entirely different one - simply being run/owned by the same company that operates PornHub would put a huge stigma on it.

I'd also point towards Voat when everyone got mad at Reddit a year or two ago as an example of how the community you attract is important. Voat was a good idea in principle that quickly turned into a cesspool.
Or just 'Hub'.
YouTube's unforgivable sin was blocking playing videos from lock screen without a subscription. 
First they cancel small content creators partnerships now they start banning gun channels. YouTube has gone to shit
Why does everybody hate YouTube?
[deleted]
Great idea, until TheHub also grows too big and starts to realize they need to make money - the cycle repeats and before you know it we're all on Dailymotion.
IIRC isn't like a massive portion of pornhub's content stolen, whether from camgirls or other indie sex workers? 

If they tried to operate on that same model with non-sexual content, I don't think it'd fly anywhere near as far.
YouHub*
This doesn't belong in /r/CrazyIdeas, this is a sane idea.
That’s a huge risk... look at voat and tell me that it’s any better than reddit.
Leave it to YouTube to drive content creators to PornHub in order to *stop* getting fucked.
One one hand, it's interesting that all this business is moving to Pornhub. On the other hand, the owner of Pornhub sucks and I can't stand the thought of him getting even a single nickel of my money
I like the idea. I think twitch might actually have a shot at competing too. They already are really. They just need to expand the type of videos they have beyond gaming.
Youtube NEEDS competition with their stupid censorship


10/10 would convert
And then be able to search through real categories like Geography, Space, oceanography! Honestly I can't believe youtube doesn't let you search terms inside a certain category.  
I had the same thought last night, it would be a reddit killer 
Drop the "The". Just _Hub_.
Honestly, that would be the next logical business move for the company.  The climate is ripe for competition. Linus is doing something similar with floatplane. 

What I think they could do is have a platform that allows people to post videos that would break youtubes ever changing rules. Nudity could be allowed, but not straight up porn (thats for the sister site).  Gun videos should be allowed, as long as they aren’t showing violence towards people. 

Just keep it as a level platform. People assume responsibility for what they post. Oh, and don’t fucking deploy an algorithm. Just let that shit naturally work out. 



Everything else would be somewhat minor challenges. 
	•	have a solid mobile application with download videos available (for pro users)
	•	have a solid web application 
	•	have a very solid and clean app on
	⁃	roku
	⁃	appletv 
	⁃	amazon fire stick 
	•	Offer a premium service for income that supports 4k videos & supports a few different features. 
	•	Don’t do tiered with your premium service, just straight up you pay $5/mo you get everything. 
	•	Offset the cost by requiring the content posters to pay a fee / video 
	⁃	I know, controversial, but this can be a small amount (like $1/video) or a flat subscription fee for them ($20 / mo) to host unlimited videos at 4k. 
	•	be the first to get the HDR standard 
	⁃	video engineer here: this will be the big leap. 

Pornhub do have a more wholesome comment section than YouTube 
I did not lose a leg in vietnam so you kids could use thehub for storing video.
pornhub isn't even the top porn site..
A mix of 1300 people and Russian bots think this idea may be just crazy enough to work.
You already have it, welcome to dailymotion.com
It would only be worth it if there was significantly less censorship and demonetization than on standard YouTube.

That said, if they pull it off, fuck Google's bullshit. 
I too have been on reddit in the past week
[deleted]
That's actually a good idea. 
YouTube has honestly gone batshit crazy with demonitizing and ads. Some fucking video of a kid doing some stupid challenge where you walk around with a swastika on your forehead and ask for Jews is fine, but a video with swearing demonitized. It sucks and it hurts the creators I love who don't have swastikas
Shut down the /r/conspiracy sub. Give no explanation.

What are you talking about? Theres never been an /r/conspiracy...
This post is clearly a cover for actual plan to shut down r/conspiracy, which is surely being put into motion.
[deleted]
Better yet, pick a frequent poster on there and literally censor the shit out of their account. Delete many of their r/conspiracy posts, ban them from the subreddit and others. Then sit back and watch the fun their new throwaway causes in a hasty ruckus in response to their "censorship".
I need 25 comment karma so I can post on r/cats

Edit: Bless you, reddit! I'll be at r/cats if you need me.

Edit 2: I was wrong. There is work yet to be done. 

Edit 3: Huzzah! I was right. Profile hadn't updated. 
That's mean.  Funny though, Admins, get to it.
Better yet, pretend it never existed and delete any comments referring to it for trolling. 
[deleted]
Its just a distraction from the real conspiracy.
The real conspiracy here is this seemingly joke suggestion actually is orchestrated by Central Intelligence as a warning to the sub who recently came across some very sensitive information. 
It’s really a shame. That sub used to be a great place to go and read some crazy theories. Now it’s just another t_d clone. 
Tell them it's shut for safety reasons due to a swamp gas leak and that FEMA will take over temporary control when it returns.
Sadly r/conspiracy has become a Trump supporter safe haven, and they're super touchy about calling people fucking idiots or implying 90% of the sub has PPD. 
r/conspiracy is a cess pool for Russian Trolls. They are very active there and at T_D. 


Bury r/conspiracy in the fake basement of a pizza shop
Then bring it back and delete just one single random thread as if it were the cause for the shutdown..
It's the shadow government, maaaaaan!
That would be a great April Fool's joke.
[deleted]
It's already been shut down in a way. Even the mods have been taken over by Russian shills it seems, it's like the second Donald since 2016.
The shitstorm of them trying to figure out what they believe caused them to get shut down. Thinking they got some far fetched conspiracy theory right.... that would be hilarious 
I used to love that sub, until these pizzagate idiots flooded it.
/r/darknetmarkets tried that for April fools, it didn't end well... 
Hillary Clinton absolutely did not steal the DNC nomination from Bernie Sanders like /r/conspiracy suggested well before Wikileaks dropped their emails.  Ban them now!
There is no /r/conspiracy. You saw swamp gas reflecting light from Venus & confused it for a sub reddit.
r/conspiracy : where the less evidence you have, the more likely it is that it's true 
Have you seen that place over the last year? It should be shut down.
Then act like it was never there to begin with - "What conspiracy subreddit, what the heck are you talking about?"
Then delete all comments relating to explanations for it
Better yet, shut down /r/conspiracy because its a piece of shit filled with some of the worst people

/r/isrconspiracyracist
Shut down the /r/conspiracy sub. Replace it with a link to a stream that just repeats the first few thousand numbers of pi. Give no explanation. 
Better yet, shut down all of Reddit except for /r/conspiracy. 
/u/spez?
Nice try CIA, we know your plans
In several years though, in the meantime scattering tiny breadcrumbs leading back to this post.
You know what's funny? The main "conspiracy theories" of the past 45 years that the "crazies" have been talking about, because of the freedom of information act, almost all end up not only being true but actually CRAZIER than thought. But keep making fun of the free thinkers. Keep "thinking" in your box. Keep alienating anyone that has an original thought or questions the official narrative. Keep doing so and live in your blind slumber till death do you part. 
/r/conspiracy isn't even a conspiracy sub anymore. It's a dumping ground for Russian troll bots.
I don't think anyone would need an explanation: /r/conspiracy is a fucking plague.
They would blame us at tmor
It is so ridiculous. I subscribed to them thinking this would be interesting and fun. Not an hour later I unsubscribed and was disappointed/angry. They are delusional they believe anything. 

In addition I find it funny that the same people who want to privatize everything because the government is so terrible at running things are the same ones who believe the government can concoct these outlandish conspiracies and get away with it. 
That's just what *they* want you to do.
This would be a funny April Fools prank.
Better yet, send actual black helicopters to arrest and disappear everyone who posts in that lunatic shithole, and leave them there.
Roseanne tried this already 
ICARUS HAS FOUND YOU
I've always theorised that the best way to kill a conspiracy theorist would be to intercept their water supply and inject some chemical. Nobody would ever believe them...
its a fun subreddit, you guys gotta stop shitting on it and making it so partisian
*Dons tinfoil hat*

This post was engineered by the Government in order to get r/conspiracy shut down in a nonsensical manner.

omg so crzy XD
Epic first post, bro.

And it only took 7 years to hit Submit.

Thanks for the wonderful idea, though.
Keep it open, but subreddit has one link: an article about the benefits of water fluoridation.
That subreddit was no great shakes before, but I've NEVER seen one decline so fast as that one did when it became yet another Trump shithole. 
The fact that your username is over 7 years old and this is your first post is an /r/conspiracy in itself. . . .
That’s metal as fuck. Do it.
Please don't, we'd spend the next 10 years hearing about Hillary Clinton and George Soros secretly controlling Reddit.
Repost 
This is the first post in a while to get a good, solid chuckle out of me. Take your dirty upvote. 
Delete all the posts from your profile. Give no explanation.
I've sometimes wondered what would happen if someone spread the rumour that all the conspiracy theories of the world are true, but they're purposely made to sound as outrageous as people so people would never believe them. And all the conspiracy theorist are in on it.  
The TRUE conspiracy of /r/conspiracy is that it is a FALSE conspiracy created by conspiracy theorist to hide the REAL /r/conspiracy in plain sight so SHEEPLE like you to talk about all the conspiracy theorist and conspiracies on /r/conspiracy, but it is really a FALSE conspiracy and FALSE /r/conspiracy the REAL /r/conspiracy does not exist and by talking about /r/conspiracy soon everyone will become part of the TRUE conspiracy. 
This is my favorite type of evil genius.  
As far as I'm concerned it's been shut down for nearly two years, so we made this in its absence /r/conspiracyII
Why did you delete your post history OP. What's there to hide? 
Replace it with cat pics
no i like my conspiracies 
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Pretty much the same.
Obviously, this post is just priming us for when the One World Government shuts down /r/conspiracy so that we all just laugh about it.
Yeah maybe a couple years ago when they actually dealt in conspiracies. Now they’re just another shitty alt right sub. 
But where will all the great “BUH DUH LIBRULS ARE COMING TO TAKE MUH GUNS AND PIZZA = KIDS!” crazies go?
A porn video where a woman orders a pizza, pays with money. Then She has a plumber come, fix her faucet, get paid with money, then leaves. After many such psych-outs, she finally goes to bed and has sex with her loving husband.

And then the husband gets up early to take care of the kids and make breakfast? There's bound to be a market for this.
You could make dozens of dollars on this idea
[relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxb7b0jGZvc)
"Oh my, Mr. Pizza Man... I'm out of cash... If only there was some... other way?

I'll pay with Credit."
I feel like some porn company might very well take up this idea... but then make the husband her brother.

\> pays with money

Holy shit
Have her doing those things while hes at work. Home alone, making herself pretty. Then throwing herself at the husband when hes finally home. Then they eat the pizza.
WholesomePorn? 
I can't jerk off to this! *throws arms up in air and storms off*
Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here. 

 He fixes the cable? 

 Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.
this makes me uncomfortable. porn is not marketed at people who can get or maintain loving relationships, it needs to have depictions of heartless sex where people use each other for their genitals, otherwise i just get sad instead of getting a boner.
[deleted]
I write porn scripts. I'm happy to write this up so it's good but the company I work for definitely wouldn't green light it. Could probably get one of the artists to do an image set for it, though.
the plumber has to be Ron Jeremy
Let's make it even more of a curve ball by having him appear in scenes and they make comments at eachother that makes it seem they disdain eachother. 
Yes! And with lots and lots of innuendo and double entendre!
To keep it relevant to today's porn market, her handsome brother/step brother Jamie needs to show up too and ask her to help him with a problem with his pants, but it turns out he just needs help fixing a stuck zipper on his other pair of jeans.
X
[This sounds like normaling](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U5qutHb0BUE)
> Then she has a plumber come, fix her faucet

The plumber doesn't "fix her faucet", the plumber **cleans out her pipes**. 

If you're going to use the cliché, do it right! 
They need a porn site where 9/10 videos are of girls turning you down. That way when you get one it feels legit.
Plot twist, the plumber, the pizzaboy and her husband are all the same person.
I just want to fap. Why am I wasting time watch story?
that was the same guy that made and delivered the pizza and fixed the plumbing.  Everyone said he was a great guy.
Between this and showerthoughts I'm convinced most the people on this site are actually retarded
time stamp plz
Why not? I'd watch it - that's what the fast forward button on the remote is for. 
The game has changed.
I get the idea, but it would be pretty fucking boring 
/r/madlads
Consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation. 
even crazier, the husband and wife talk about having a baby, and choose to have sex with the means of starting/expanding the family.
id skip to the banging anyway so whatever
And it's an awesome 11 minutes of missionary 
I'm so flaccid right now
/r/WholesomePorn ?
to borrow from the South Park boys, "Maybe you can help me *buff my floors*.. if you.. know what I mean."
What the fuck is next? Their babysitter comes over to watch over the kids, the husband and wife wishing her good luck before going off to work?
 Maybe even the babysitter declines the request of her boyfriend, who says he wants to come over and fuck her in the ass, as she has great respect for her employers and the kids she's sitting?  
  
You people are fucking sickening.
You sick fuck.
Other than a hardcore reality fetishist, who do you think would sit through the first 3/4 of your film?

Seems like a pretty niche market.
This shit hit too close to home, bruh.
This made me laugh and then snort briefly through my nostrils.
That's a lot of fast forwarding. 
My wife has a master's degree from a prestigious school in " Women's Studies" so to irk her I came up with an idea of "To Light the Fire, You Need to Burn the Bra!" porno.

Amelia Earhart: has hot sex while flying across the Pacific and the cumshot is right in both eyes causing a crash on a deserted island.

Helen Keller: Anne Sullivan becomes Andrew Sullivan "Yes Helen water! Yes, yes Helen, this is cock!"

Susan B Anthony: "Yeah! You want to vote, do ya? Dirty Susan Bs better get on those knees.."



Mind blowing... Lol.
I would pay to watch it. Especially if the plumber takes home the leftover pizza
Unrealistic, no one is in the mood after a whole pizza and getting fucked by a Plumbers bill.
Twist: The pizza guy and plumber are banging her husband when she gets to her bedroom.
Who was playing video games up until that point.

The sex lasts 2 minutes and then she thinks longingly about the plumber from earlier.
/r/WholesomePorn 
This is more of a /r/stupidideas 
Rule 42?
That sounds fucking hilarious, need to watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkq4ipN-FTU
I am kinda surprised that there isn't a niche where wifes actually want to have sex with their husbands. I know that'd do it for me...

>skips to right near the end for the money shot 

>works backwards from there to the sex.

>ignores entire plot as usual
So it's like that ["Life Without Porn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7p39EyfQfI) video, except the ending is a little different.
Is it OK if I only watch the last five minutes?
Lets be real we would all skip to the action part

Thats why porn acting sucks in the first place cuz nobody watches it 

I have to admit though it is a crazy idea 
It's probably out there somewhere. But you gotta do them all. Hubby leaves for work in the morning. Then do plumber, mailman delivering a "big package", then the she gets her pizza with "extra sausage", then a run in with the neighbors son who is visiting from college, then she goes for a walk an encounters some black guys hanging out, they all just go normally which is the joke. Then hubby comes home they bang and it ends with them lying in bed and saying "I love you".
r/wholesomememes
Meh. I wouldn't last past that first scene, so the plumber scene would be lost on me.
It should end with the plumber, pizza man, and whatever other service employee she paid that day paying her to have sex.
http://i.imgur.com/vqMOTbo.gif
Slut
you can commision porn now, that duck guy did it a while ago.
Jesus fuck OP, you have some dark twisted mind you sick fuck. Next you'll tell me you like to have sex with your wife in missionary. 
There is an untapped market space of wholesome totally normal run of the mill porn just waiting to just get filled, *if you what I mean.* 
Pervert.
Come on down to Real Fake Porn!
The word "loving" is a boner killer in OP.
Jesus Christ, what kind of sick fetish is this? What kind of depraved bastard comes up with this shit?
See this is where you fucked up

>After many such psych-outs, she finally goes to bed and has sex with her loving 

Wife 
That's my fetish
Don't forget about the cable. 
i dont know man, thats way over the top
[I'll just leave this here](https://www.xvideos.com/video17816271/veronica_has_a_great_ass) 

Has the same premise at first, then take a left turn. 
Then the husband pays her with money.
Make it her wife instead of her husband and I'll buy a copy on bluray. 
"I'm sure you can imagine what happens next."

"He fixes the cable?"
You're nuts 
Anal sex, I presume. 
Plot twist, every single guy is played by Danny D. 
I don't know, I know this is r/CrazyIdeas but slow down.
They have to be played by the iconic cheesy pornstars like Danny D and Johnny Sins. 
It's too obviously a fantasy. That would never happen in real life /s.
This is called nycegidephelia, a condition where one obsessively romanticizes his self image as a nycegi in hopes that one day he will be that loving husband. I don't think it's curable.
Better: she orders a pizza and has a plumber come. The pizza guy and the plumber fuck. She is not involved 
So the husband has to pay for all of the work and have sex with his wife?
Love this!!!

All films have a climax...  think about it.
Just under the covers missionary too, with complete eye contact
I definitely made this movie a few years back: https://youtu.be/5oXZzGbM_B4
Not gonna lie, got a semi rn
That sounds like a wholesome relationship, unlike what porn portrays.  When are we going to realize that it's not normal human nature to watch other people have sex? 
Surprise ! Everyone's in the bed 
...as well as his friends, the pizza delivery guy, the plumber and a few others we saw earlier

Stop this Madness
then the plumber comes back and fucks her in the ass while she is asleep
I'm so hard!!! 
Someone fire this man
This would be like the Splash Mountain of pornographic films.
So....when am I supposed to jerk off? 
You know, that just might work
What if she gets into bed with her husband tells him she has a headache, rolls over and goes to sleep?  So, the video is really just some guy sad jerking it.The end. 
Sounds great, especially if directed by a woman and female gaze-y. (Source: am lady.)

They make love in the missionary position, saying "I love you" several times

Uh no ma'sm. That's just regular. Well, see ya later

That is very sexist to the woman
I am soooooo gonna out crazy your crazy OP
That's boring.
As a former pornstar I think this idea is AWESOME! 

Actually I'm gonna steal your idea and make this video, hope that's ok! 
ITT: People mistakes lust for love. You fuck someone out of lust ( may or may not be in combo with other things such as need). You don't fuck someone out of love.

You love your kids, you would not want to fuck them would you?
But does the husband then pay her with money?  I feel like that's how this should go.
The only problem with this I will have finished waaaay before it gets to the sex lol
"I can't fuck my husband - I'd be cheating on my plumber and pizza guy"

Ideally fix the faucet first so that the pizza doesn't get too cold. 
Jake and Amir came up with this idea years ago. Someone even registered the domain for www.fuckmefinally.com
Don't forget about her going outside to admire her lemon trees.
put a kid in the video and it'll be a real fantasy.  at least based on what I hear from my friends with wives post baby.

But when does he fix the cable?
Nice and all, but most people are just skipping to the sex anyway.

Every time someone shows up it's accompanied by HEAVY funk. I'm talking a bass guitar getting slapped fast and loose by some kind of mad, delirious, funky priest channelling the unstoppable force of Bootsy Collins. Really ups the psych factor.
I'm trying to nut not watch a soap opera. 
Maybe they could have sex in the kitchen while making salad? 🤔
"Loving"? Clearly, you don't porn.
Came and fix her faucet ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
10/10 Porno plot
TIL /r/WholesomePorn existed. Mostly because I typed it jokingly, but then hovered over it in the preview window and it actually came up with stuff.

So your pitch has a place.
As long as all the deliverers and plumbers and what not are super hot chicks dressed as hot as ever... I guess I'd be okay with it.
If i know anything about porn and reddit, give it 24 hours and someone will post a link to a porn scene doing the very thing 
This idea is just wonderful.  Really, this should get done

Sounds like a plot by M. Knight Shyamalan
Every year, the richest person in America is declared the "Winner of Capitalism." They get a badge. Then all of their wealth is donated to charity and they have to start over at $0.

We'll call the award ceremony the Blue Shell awards.
Aim to always be second richest
[deleted]
This just turns into a competition to hide how much money they have. 
Didn’t like to prestige in the game..surely I wouldn’t irl.
but after they are redistributed they automatically get a Go Fund Me and all our thoughts and prayers. So its actually a pretty good deal. 
It would result in them exploiting the loopholes to make themselves appear less wealthy.
r/LateStageCapitalism is leaking
[deleted]
Ah yes. I’m sure penalizing the rich won’t incentivize them to hide they’re money away. They would never do that to the government or the poor. /s
This is hilarious. I suspect that in your alternate universe state sponsored shell companies and other loopholes would hide wealth and the middle class would be declared the winner of capitalism every year through a generalized tie, but that kinda already happens.

Edit: spelling
Sounds like a great way to get people to hide all of their money offshore and to kill companies. 
Am i taking this too seriously?
A lot of the wealthiest people have only a perceived wealth. For instance, Jeff Bezos is now the richest many in the world, but only because he holds a giant stake in Amazon. 

A lot of people tend to think these people just have all this cash on hand, whilst their wealth is heavily diversified and not really just sitting in a bank. 
How about we let people keep their own property regardless of how much property they have? 
It’s so weird that jimmy kimmel conveniently said this last night
This is... awful
That's so incredibly stupid I'm surprised it got upvoted even in this sub.
subReddit checks out
"Donated"
PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY THAN ME ARE BAD!
r/StupidIdeas
> They get a badge. Then all of their wealth is donated to charity and they have to start over at $0

What a fancy way of saying "they get all of their assets seized by the state and told to go fuck themselves."

But we're still totally against government overreach, right? We're totally not piece of shit commies, right?
$0 isn't really fair. But how about this? Take all the money and then give them a credit card with no limit and they're "retired."

How much could they really spend compared to what they have? We could fund a universal basic income off the interest.
They’ll just hide their money in off shore accounts. The “loser” will be a middle class white guy.

Curious to why you have to punish wealth generation?
Yeah that sounds fun. Work your ass off and then it all disappears.  What an incentive. 
How about we round up the poor and gas em! Less people = less global warming c'mon my commie friends dont you like planer earth? Are you really greedy enough to choose your meager life over the planet?
This is complete bullshit.  It never ceases to amaze me how gullible people are
I too saw Jimmy Kimmel's monologue last night...but yeah, cool idea.
Be gone, commie scum.
This is a great way to get rid of everyone earning over like $20k from your country - everyone else with a brain cell will just move somewhere else.
Markets collapse. Civil services stop. Food and water shortages. Lawlessness. 3rd world nation within 6mo.   Normal people with families resent the revolutionary types who ushered in these policies and retaliate. But yea we stuck it to capitalism!
This is what socialists actually believe would work.
thats not how capitalism works.
It's a great idea till said Democrat with the idea makes money and comes in first and then absolutely will be the same as any said "rich republican" 
So socialism? You’re right, that’s a crazy bad idea. 
So the goal is to come in second?
 By the numbers, investments do more good than charity. Let them keep their money and some product somewhere will get better and cheaper.
The ultimate prestige mode
They had a thing in Roman or some other ancient civilization, where they voted every year on the most influential person in the city, and he was then banished.  Probably already mentioned in this thread, but I'm too drunk to find it.
Prestige for the capitalism game. I like it.
Or we become socialists/communists. This way everyone gets to start and stay at $0, technological progress is halted, and a quarter of our population dies due to the corrupt and incompetent dictator that inevitably takes over...
How mentally ill do you have to be for this to remotely even sound like a good idea?? 
[deleted]
That sounds like communism
If people will prestige in CoD they might do this
So second place is the real winner.
Interesting.  The race to be second would be entertaining.
Nobody would be American anymore. All the capitalists in the running would change their citizenship to something else while still participating in America's markets.
Bunch of conservatives yelling they don’t pay enough in taxes, could be entertaining 
Honestly, their social connections, class, education, and personal skillset that enabled them to become the richest person already prepare them to make fucktons of money the nxt year, even restarting from a soup kitchen startup economic tier.
"For it was said the last shall be first and the first shall be last."

If Jesus was an economic advisor...

All people would  sell all they own every year and give the rest to charity. All debts would be forgiven.

The result? 
And just like in socialism there will be no incentive to make money since tbe government just takes it all away 
\> A *genuinely crazy* idea in r/CrazyIdeas?  Fuck outta here with that!

\- r/CrazyIdeas, probably.
This is not entirely different from ancient Greek [ostracism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism).
Because we don't have enough problems with rich people hiding their money...
[deleted]
Right? Because if being successful is easy they'll have no problem doing it a second time
That's not crazy. That's just stupid.
Except the very wealthy are already poor on paper. That's why you hire an estate planning attorney. Can't lose what you don't personally own. The goal is control, not ownership. 
This would be great cause then'd you have a bunch of rich people donating or buying things in order to not be the richest. 
The sad part, $0 is ahead of a lot of people.  
It's like playing new game +.
ITT: teenagers living in a fantasy world that doesnt exist
When it gets close to the end of the year the richest people start giving stuff away so they don’t have to give it all away 
Orrrr instead of transferring it somewhere or spending it all, they donate to a good cause to try and be 2nd. Gotta believe they would try and do something useful/kind with it. Idk if someone already said this or not!!
Wow what a terrible fucking idea. 
they'd have it all back again in 5 or 10 years. people who don't understand money will never understand that people who do understand it don't get what they have just by luck
Sounds like a bad idea 
Thats more in tune with socialism and the BERNIECANSTILLWIN!!!!!REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE folks....
This is completely delusional, does the person even get to choose who he gives his money to or is it just taken and distributed evenly?, whoever came up with this is  a communist cuck.
Real life isn't reddit. The reason I work hard at my business is to leave something greater for my kids than my parents left for me. 

If everyone had that approach to life rather than expecting hand outs, there would be no poverty in a few years time.

An employee of mine who makes nowhere close to what I make has an iphone x and I'm still using my iphone 6. 

People are poor because of poor choices more than anything, being born into poverty should be even more motivation to make better choices than ones parents did.
Big bucks no whammies no whammies STOP
One of the dumbest ideas I’ve ever heard, sound more like the winner of socialism. 
you have either been banned or modded at r/latestagecapitalism


probably banned though
This isn't capitalism, this is socialism.
Real life prestige mode. What kind of badge do they get when they prestige?
America isn't capitalist. 
Jeff Bezos is worth over $104 billion

That's roughly 1 month in the iraq war. or something like that.
I’d stop evading my taxes
Most every rich person who was not born wealthy has hit zero many times before any money actually stuck. 
That is a pretty good way to fix the overpopulation of America
And if they can bootstrap their way up from their cardboard box, they get a medal
Good thing Bill Gates being rich brings more good than him just donating everything to charity. He knows what he's doing and he's fixing the world.
Taxation is theft.
The real life implementation of this would be they win and then get everyone else's money as the prize.
Yeah fuck that 
lmao classic reddit liberal bullshit.
Found the Marxist!
the winner will be the guy with all the guns in that scenario.... 
hey watch this become a movie in a few years and then everyone freaks out when it comes to light that the idea was taken from a reddit post haha
This reads like a r/writingprompts!   

Every year, the richest person in America is declared the "Winner of Capitalism." They get a badge. Then all of their wealth is donated to charity and they have to start over at $0. You have won 7 consecutive years, people are starting to question where do you get the money
Just imagine the reverse hunger games that this would start, where all the rich people are trying to be rich, but not too rich, and are just waiting for that one deal that will make Harry Richman the richest, and therefore, ruin him.

"Here, Richman. A contract for $200 million courtesy of Uncle Sam!"

"...You bastard."
I just imagine people at the top spending like crazy to get below each other in wealth. Pockets just spilling money.
Quick, someone remind me which indigenous north american tribe does this. I think its the Tlingit. 
I mean if they're really as special as they claim they'll be fine.
The richest will twist it so that one of the lower class people wins.
Introducing prestige mode into capitalism? Its like a play right out of EA's handbook.
I feel like every year at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, there would be an insane amount of charitable donations and bank withdrawals.  
Edit: 11:59 p.m. on December 31st 
We need to come up with a good reward for anyone who manages to win capitalism twice
Every ten years the ancient Greeks would vote on who should be ostracized and exiled from the community for being too powerful or influential. Some of these guys would actually keep on doing quite well and come back with an army to invade their city 
That would redistribute the wealth REAL fast
Then his company goes under, the thousands upon thousands of people he employed are redundant but at least they have a dollar or two from the donation.
good story but too close to reality and you get to be president and lie about your wealth 
I patted Bezos’ bald spot back in 2000, and now he is the richest man in the world.  Coincidence?  Probably.
You got this from Jimmy kimmel.
This sounds like the the Supernova rule for a game called [Cosmic Wimpout](http://cosmicwimpout.com/p/7/How-To-Play), which is a pretty fun dice game.

You scored too many points, so you automatically lose.
Yeah cause the richest person in the world aint gonna be able to use that rep to get billions in start up money. 
As a whole we would **all** be better off without **anyone** being stolen from.
They should prestige there money into top end assets like in cod
make it a hundy, and you're on!
Or just make a law where the richest person in the world is fair game for hunters.  Then you sit back and let nature take its course.
Fuck.  If only I was named Charity 
You'd have to take all the money, spread it around evenly and start everyone off on an equal footing the next year to be fair. Otherwise the person who comes in second is already ahead.
But ... but ... the Gates foundation ... they are, like, curing cancer, man.
How about every week, as long as we're in /r/CrazyIdeas?
logical version: You can only pass down 50 million of inheritance when you die. All the excess wealth is used to fund helpful government programs or portioned out on everyone's tax returns. 
The winner gets to live for free, anything they want. But no inheritance allowed.
Every year, the richest person donates 3/4 of there yearly gross income for a 62/ 38 split fro taxable income over the next 4 years.
If I won capitalism I would choose not to prestige it 
This is the best one I read yet
This could actually work.   He would almost Force the trickle down economics to be true and the richest people would be hiring lawyers to do the other richest people in the country because they lied about where their wealth was. I think this system would keep everybody honest.
"Oh yea, well I'm a 5th prestige hyper capitalist, so goml, nerd."
BETTER DEAD THAN RED, SINCE 1991, YOU COMMIES!
What Black Mirror episode is this?
I think that might be called "Communism".
Looking at you Jeff Pesos
It's not hard to obscure your wealth, so this would just result in some poor sod who's actually the 50th richest American gets all his money taken away because he wasn't as good at hiding it as the top 49. Also it's literally stealing.
And a fifth bust on Mount Rushmore if you do it twice.
I always like games that reset after a round.
So like taxes?
>and they have to start over at $0.

And they are allowed zero connections to the other rich buddies they kept around themselves, otherwise it would be way too easy.
Quite frankly, the stupidest idea I have ever read about. Sit down.
Well at least you posted this to the appropriate subreddit 
So you mean socialism?
well the #1 and #3 richest guys in the US (Bill Gates and Warren Buffet) are already donating almost all of  their money to charity when they die, so... 

EDIT: [158 of the Richest people in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge) have signed the giving Pledge actually. Including but not limited to:

* Larry Ellison

* Michael Bloomberg

* Mark Zuckerburg

* Elon Musk

* Tim Cook

* David Rockefeller

* George Lucas

* Bill and Melinda Gates

* Warren Buffet
I think that is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
Challenge accepted
Announce the cutoff date and watch the rich people leave one by one until the winner is the richest person who can't afford to move. Then, all the jobs they took with them will be in other countries and America becomes a third world country overnight.

The richest people in the country already give the most to charity by a long-shot as it is, not to mention being the employers of millions. I think this class envy has got to stop already.
It’s called Prestige. And you actually get a medal. 
That's great motivation to be the second richest person in America!
Prestige mode 
Forever live and maintain mediocrity.
Since Donald Trump apparently has a serious problem distinguishing "fake" news from real news, The Onion should write a satire piece about how great he is and see if they can get him to retweet it.
That's the only thing I can think of that is more ridiculous than linking to Breitbart after calling out CNN for being "fake".

This happened with former FIFA VP Jack Warner

https://youtu.be/qr6ar3xJL_Q?t=4m25s
With fascist subtext to see how much of a following it gets
I think that's the best crazy idea I've seen. 

Or maybe it's just that I'd so enjoy it if it happened. 
Isn't this the origin of Machiavelli's "The Prince?"
Bonus points if you can get him to pull an LL Bean... "onion is the best newspaper in the world. Everyone should order a subscription!"

reddit has the exact same problem hth
I've got a crazy idea! Maybe just one sub can abstain from trump posts 
[deleted]
Here's a crazy one: perhaps we can stop this bullshit "fake news" narrative that only exists to smear/discredit opposing viewpoints before even having to consider despite said "fake news" actually being credible, fact-based reporting. I don't think many people have ever thought an idea that bizarre!
I really hate the passive aggressive political crap that this sub gets. 
I'm having a problem distinguishing "fake" news from "real" news. And so are Buzzfeed and CNN, according to the New York Times. 
98% chance of hillary winning
Well, he was calling CNN out for running that rumor BuzzFeed started.  I can't think of anything more fake than an unsubstantiated, unverified, error-filled "report" of dubious origin.  It'd be like Fox running an unverified story they found on 4chan about how Obama allegedly eats babies.
I thought it would be hilarious if SNL portrayed him as a rational honest being.  
Remember when colbert was considered right wing by some? This could actually work. If I went to Facebook, which I dont...I'd see many shares if such a thing happened and it would be glorious.
No. To be real about it. Him calling CNN seems nothing more than a ploy to divide and distort what is 'fake news'. He knows his supporters will consider CNN fake news from then on, and the other side will fight it. Then before you know it, every outlet is fake news and everything he says is true and correct.
Onion is not fake news, it's parody and satire. CNN, Buzzfeed, Huff Post, have all embarassed themselves incredibly over the last year during this election cycle. I don't call them fake news but it's actually alarming how little actual journalism there is. It's all about pushing their narrative, and whether you're a liberal or a trumpett, you have to be able to see that.
[deleted]
Well, as funny as that would be, it appears that Trump is 3 steps ahead of all his naysayers since the beginning of his campaign. So he'd retweet out the article saying that the Onion is a funny news site and how their purposefully misleading news is still more accurate than CNN. 

He'd get more Onions views for a funny publication (which it deserves) and further embarrass CNN. 



I really just want to use reddit without a bunch of God damn people making political "jokes." If I wanted to see this id go r/politics
Why is Reddit defending CNN?

This is Reddit.  We hate the Mainstream Media. 
CNN is propaganda just like the rest of the 24 hour media. Get a clue and grow up.
[Here’s a screenshot of CNN not being fake news.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0226/7001/articles/CNN-Says-It_s-ILLEGAL-For-Public-To-Read-WikiLeaks-Emails-_VIDEO.jpg?v=1476700427)
CNN is fake
Why is this posted in r/CrazyIdeas? This is actually an amazing idea. 
....Holy shit. I like this idea. This is like...4chan level trolling that doesn't involve bodily fluids. 
I see /r/politics has resorted to brigading other subs with their Trump hate-spam since their own sub lost all credility.
CNN is blatantly fake. They even said you couldn't read the Wikileaks emails but they could. Which is complete bullshit.

Corporate media is self-serving. 
Another sub gets filtered :(
Oh yeah why would he not think CNN amd Buzzfeed are reliable sources of information right?
Woah dude. That was such a crazy idea. Calm the fuck down 
Has every sub gone full potato? 
Or maybe it is you with the discernment problem, OP.
Is anyone else seriously alarmed by how this guy treats news about himself? He lies to his supporters calling any negative news about him as fake (and they seem to buy it) and the people who are against him seem to be so entrenched in this "I told you so" mentality that just makes both sides too proud to have a discussion.

I'm pretty scared for the country and modern media. Sure MSM isn't the greatest, but it's always easier to say it'd be better if it was different. The grass is always greener.

Edit: this was a pretty controversial comment, I was just trying to get people to be constructive in their criticism
He would buy that s**t in less than a second.
Trump is the target of fake news you poor dumbass.
CNN runs constant unproven Russian stories and establishment propaganda. It is fake. As is Fox. As is MSNBC.
3 more days cupcakes
Trump and most of his supporters can tell the difference just fine, it's the libtards and propaganda outlets like CNN that have a problem.

Edit: in this sub I bask in the warmth of your downvotes, keep them coming :-)
Yea, then watch as the onion gets invited to white house press conferences, gets to ask the first question, and becomes actual news because the satire they make up starts becoming the reality of the Trump presidency.
I know this is humor, but do people honestly think the election was covered fairly on CNN?  Time Warner own CNN.  They also donated over $400,000 to her campaign.  *this* is why fake news (or biased/bullshit news) is a problem.  Mind you, it's bad when any news source lies, liberal leaning or not.

oddly enough, comedy sites are often more truthful than CNN.  go figure!
I am not a supporter of Trump, but CNN has lied multiple times and mislead it's readers based on it's own political bias.
Uh oh, looks like /r/politics is leaking into other sub reddits again
[removed]
its not difficult at all. anything from the MSM is fake
Wow liberals are literally seeping into every subreddit. Time to block this useless subreddit and pass on the word. 
Sorta like how CNN and Buzzfeed have been reporting 4Chan tweets?
Lmao American public has a serious problem distinguishing fake and real news.
YES! Somebody make this happen because it would be hilarious!
OH BOY DAS A GUD ONE
From what I know of his targeted demographic, this is exactly part of the reason he won anyway. 
Brilliant.
Well now that you posted this idea it won't happen. Shoulda contacted The Onion instead of making this thread.
DO IT!
Please, onion, pick this up...
Ya but see now you aren't differentiating between fake news and satire. 
CNN is fake though
CNN has reported illegitimate information. 
CNN is pretty untrustable
CNN said it was illegal to read the Wikileak emails and the only way it was allowed to be dispersed was through the media. Fake news.
Meanwhile people still believe he got hookers to piss on him on Obamas old bed after watching japanime.
I think it's pretty rich for Trump to call anything fake. Trump is fake. 
The liberals are the ones who can't tell the difference between real and fake news. The liberal media puts out fake stories about Trump 24/7 and they're all too stupid tinnitus realize it.
ITT: Trump supports getting triggered more than the people they mock when they say triggered.
Most people do...

I don't think there is a person alive who can distinguish fake news and real news all the time, even with video evidence stories still get twisted to match rhetoric to push an agenda. 

Also.....

Breitbart is an openly conservative new source

CNN tells people they are non-partisan even after they are caught colluding with a presidential campaign.

 


CNN is fake news. Apparently you have a hard time distinguishing exaggeration from normal speech.
Every once in a while this sub gets me nodding my head in agreement. 
/r/amazingideas

I love this idea. I seriously do.
Does *every* sub need to put anti-trump shit on the front page now??

Can't we keep politics in the politics subs so we can just filter them out. This site is becoming unuseable.

It's literally anti-trump shit, weird porn, and occasional funny posts... admins fucked it up trying to censor shit they didn't like.
[deleted]
CNN is fake news.
Does this belong here? I mean it's not a crazy idea - it's a great idea. Just saying. 
That's what CNN gets for running with a fake buzzfeed article. 
"According to fake news sites funded by Soros, Trump has a problem with distinguishing the fake news of our opposition from the real news which only we procure and only Soros funded organizations can determine." 

Very convincing post, comrade.
It's simple to tell the difference.  If the news agency reported Hillary had a 99% chance to win the election, its fake news.
And you OP are a grade A sheep. 
There's literally nothing crazy about this idea. 
Pretty sure donald trump has been accurate when calling out fake news. 
Obama should resign on the 19th, making Biden the 45th President and fucking up the Trump memorabilia
And then Biden should resign that afternoon, making Paul Ryan the President and forcing him to resign as Speaker, just for the bantz.
This might be a crazy idea as well, but wouldn't this just lead to the sale of more Trump memorabilia? 
I would like to hire you to come up with more shenanigans. 
Or he could just launch all the nukes, leaving Trump with a tough clean-up job on day one,  as a social experiment. 
  Biden immediately declares marshall law, arrests the Donald and invades Canada. 
I'm actually getting political spam emails that seem to be seriously suggesting stuff that is this level of ridiculous. I got one trying to petition someone to just not inaugurate new GOP senators so they can never actually take office and never actually do anything.

It's as crazy as this!
Then Biden could award Obama the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
To be clear, Biden resigning wouldn't make Paul Ryan "President" by title. He'd be more like "Acting-President".
 You're in the wrong place.  This is /r/Crazyideas.  /R/fuckingbrilliantideas is over that way.
If anything it would make this kind of memorabilia even more collectible.
This is a fun thread to read 5 years later.
How in the....
5 years later...
Preface: I am not a Trump supporter, nor even an American citizen

but why does this sub have so many anti-Trump posts?

Before the election, politics were almost never even mentioned in this sub.
How does this thread feel about Trump being president? I mean he had the craziest fucking idea and executed it. He became president.
Man, talk about Petty. 

Edit: showing respect.
Coming back in 2022... ***gulp***
Peaceful transfer of power 
Joe Biden should drink 22 liters of water and give Donald's desk a complimentary golden soaking. 
Or maybe close Guantanamo.
Uh oh, looks like /r/politics is leaking into other sub reddits again 
The intel community needs to spread the word that Trump has secret plans to have Putin assassinated forcing Putin to release all of the dirt on the perverted treasonous Cheeto.

I'd settle for Obama peeing on the stage the night before

Biden immediately resigns, making Paul Ryan next in line, forcing him to resign from Congress because you can't hold jobs on both branches. And I'm pretty sure the 25th and the order of succession law doesn't allow you to say "no thanks". 
I want this to become an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia titled "The gang become president of the united states." 

The episode would revolve around trying to screw up Trumps inauguration, not for political reasons, but for the lulz. So through a series of epic twists, somehow charlie becomes president. Then he falls under the pressure within a day, and gives the job to frank. Dennis then tells charlie he can't just give the presidency to frank. Somehow Frank is the new president much to Dennis's dismay. Then Frank crumbles and gives it to Dee. Again Dennis bitches. Dee is now Americas first female president. She crumbles within a day, and gives it to Mac. More bitching from Dennis. Mac then gives it to Dennis. Dennis then  brags about how much he's going to show the others how much he's going to president the shit out of the country. He walks into the white house, and one of the mcpoyles are his cheif administrative staff. A woman in her 90s, who immediately sexually molests him. He resigns within 5 minutes. 

On their walk home, they pass the waitress. Charlie tries impressing her saying he was once the president of the united states, to which she just says "no you weren't charlie, shut up...." 
Im not american, but is this actually possible? What would be the consequences of them actually doing this(other than america seeming even more dumb internationally)?
Trump would just send all of his memorabilia back to China so they could update it and ship it back.
I'm detecting high levels of saltiness in this sector.
In the past 12 months, I wonder how many times I've heard this, it's quite amusing.
This was an andy levy tweet a little over a year ago
If Obama seriously did this, can you imagine the chaos it would cause?  I mean, Presidential briefings are a huge job, and this time, the briefers would be forced to go 2 times in 2 days.  You can say Biden knows plenty and that it's unlikely that any kind of constitutional crisis would happen in that day, but lately who knows?
Nice and petty, just up Obama's alley.
How fucking petty and obsessed can you people be?
Crazy idea: keep politically polarizing bullshit off this sub. 
I LOVE this idea!


Edit: sp
Its really cool that you liked someone else's idea so much from a couple of days ago, that you thought it would be a good idea to copy it for internet points! Congratulations!

/r/im14andthisisfunny/
Yep, sounds like a bitch move. Just like a drone strike on a school in Syria or exiling patriots. Status quo for Obama. 
Leaving a legacy of childish, petty and immature for coming generations of democrats to follow in the footsteps of....... Yea the world certainly needs that.......
Honestly in reality this move would just be another childish sore loser move that would just hurt his own legacy a lot more. 
Serious question, if Biden became president for a day before Trump takes office, would Biden be allowed to serve for 2 terms (8years) if he became president in 2020, or would he only be allowed 1 term (4 years)? 
Laughed audibly at this. Why stop there? Go down the chain of command. See how high we can get in one day. 
Im curious how many chromosomes the average purchaser of Donald Trump memorabilia has. 

Voting for him was one thing, but who would buy memorabilia before he even gets in office?
Well, with a moderate chance of Trump being impeached on day 1 over Russian ties, there is an off chance that a 1 day Biden presidency would deprive Trump of the historic title of shortest presidency. 
To Disney - Don’t release any trailers or details for Star Wars episode 9, just have blank posters that say Star Wars episode 9 on posters and have 30 second long silent commercials that only say Star Wars episode 9, nothing else.

Hype would be Ridiculous 
Skip the 9, make it roman numeral X, and watch the fights over whether it's Star Wars X, or Star Wars 10.
Also just have the whole movie be Jar Jar Binks delivering a 3 hour monologue.
I've long held the belief that Star Wars is the only film franchise that could release in theaters without a single dollar spent on marketing and that move would generate so much hype (money) anyway.
Black screen; and a burst of sound happens, its clearly a light saber, now lighting the screen is a date, 12-something-19, in star wars font. Whoosh the sound of the light saber turning off. And it's all over.

Dear Disney, message me and we can talk royalties or job offers
I'm surprised nobody is doing the 30 second long 'static' commercial already.

We dvr everything these days, and skip the commercials. Seems like a good pay off to put up a cheap ad, still get your brand out there (chances are your dvr skips in 15-30 second blocks), and you save a fortune on production costs. 
This is not a crazy idea. This is marketing as usual. 

You know what crazy is? Make a trailer spiling all the important plot points. And make those plot points never occurred in the movie.
Then show a cute new animal for one second
it's true they really don't need to put a bunch of money into advertising. the captive audience that's ready to eat their content up already exists, you don't have to convince anyone. you aren't capturing new star wars fans by now. Disney this is a legit good business move, you should listen to OP> 
But then they wouldn't be able to sell plush toys and figurines of the new characters months before release...
But [we already know what it is going to be called](http://theinfosphere.org/images/a/a9/Yoda%27s_bar_mitzvah.PNG).

[(Bonus Image)](https://amenvamen.com/amenvamen/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jewish-Yoda.jpg?x72931)
I successfully avoided all marketing except posters for episode 7 and 8. No previews, no teasers, no articles. 10/10 would recommend. 
i can't find the trailer on youtube, but I swear there was a trailer in the the uk for the Matrix that just said "no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself". It worked, I wanted to see it so so much.
And we'll still see hundreds of you tubers giving their analysis of these trailers. 
Ahh.. Just make the whole thing an old school  animation mixed with live actors musical like Song of South or Pete's Dragons.  
IT BROKE NEW GROUND!
I abstained from all Ep. 8 trailers and commercials. Best decision 
The movie felt more magical and I had no idea what was going to happen 
Make it rated R and just basically be John Wick with lightsabers
gabbo, Gabbo, GABBO!
Or they could just reuse return of the Jedi commericals,  I'm sure they will be similar enough.
I still want Harrison Ford to play young Ham Solo
Out of nowhere, they should release a 15 second Star Wars tv spot. Instead of the expected silence (like the past trailers), this would contain nothing but screaming and red flashes [like the End of Evangelion trailer](https://youtu.be/hsfPgtKstfc). Nobody will understand what the hell the final Star Wars movie will be like.
Gabbo

Gabbo 

GABBO
I always thought PlayStation should have commercials where they just display their logo and play the sound. Just keep people aware.
I would actually like to see this, no expectations at all, save the coolest moments for the actual movie.
Also, make a good film.
[deleted]
But what about this: No hype. At all. Just one day, boom - There it is in the theaters.
Directed by David lynch
The most annoying thing about going to see Star Wars was that they aired several commercials for places that sell Star Wars merchandise right before the trailers. One of them used Rey's speech as a narration over a group of people roleplaying as different characters of the movie, which I thought was a dick move.
I want this. I always find myself wishing the movies, games, and albums dropped with no info or without warning. We know way too much about these movies from news, behind the scenes photos and trailers. I miss being a kid and knowing nothing about the movie until I saw it.
While this is 99% not likely, it, and maybe Infinity War, are guaranteed to be a commercial success even with this type of minimal advertising.

On a personal level I'm so sick of being practically shown the entire movie as a summary, and a massive hint towards the spoiler, within the 9 trailers shown leading up to movies these days. And it sucks too, some trailers are sooo good, I remember having my mind blown when I saw the Batman Begins trailer for the first time.
Or better, do basically what you said but have it be a messege about a charity or something instead of nothing.  Maybe have EP 9 in the bottom corner.  Maybe they explain some new tech that will benefit the environment or something else inspiring.  "A messege of inspiration brought to you by the upcoming release of star wars episode 9."
The background music can be a super slow version with elongated notes in a lower octave...Like someone invited Hans Zimmer to redux it
Well, you can tell by the font and the color scheme that it closely resembles, thematically at least, Attack of the Clones.  This is an obvious allusion to Kylo and Rey having an affair an conceiving twins.  This is because Star Wars doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.
people will still bitch that it didn't live up to their standards since it didn't include some scene they mentally wrote while showering.

"Kylo didn't block 3 sabers at once using his tri-blade! **THE FRANCHISE IS DEAD. IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE U ARE RETARD**
In fact, maybe don't make episode 9 at all. 
They literally can't fail with marketing at this point. The past two movies have been so hilariously terrible and just shatter box office records anyways. No one gives a shit if the movies are even kind of good, they just want more star wars.
I never watch trailers. Today's trailers are 3 minute spoilers fests.
Better yet, don't release the film either if it's as shite as the last one.
To Disney- Stop. Just fucking **STOP**
Guinness did something like this, it's one of their most famous ads. 

https://youtu.be/882_58HfuAw
Sure... 30 secs of silence gets people hyped. 
That's really not such a crazy idea. I remember the ad campaign for The Matrix was just black with green text that said "What is the Matrix?"
I wholeheartedly agree. Advertising for a movie six months in advance is getting ridiculous. Everyone will see Star Wars regardless of any advertising. 
I don't know if any of you remember this or not....but this is how it was for Jurassic Park back before it's release. In most places the trailer was nothing more than a teaser of a T-Rex roaring. The hype was crazy and that's what made every part of the movie brand new.
I’d like it if they had someone with an ominous deep voice similar to radio ads in the 80s.  Like the one for the original Dawn of the Dead.

Just saying stuff like “the epic adventure continues.  Don’t miss Star Wars: Episode 9 in theaters.  Don’t be the last one to talk about it.  Don’t be left out...”

Nothing but the logo with a crawl and lightsaber noises, tie fighter engines and blaster fire going on in the background 

Then continue the movie just like that.
Just have a good guy double bladed lightsaber ignite across the screen. That’s all I’d need. 
Honestly how many people are on the fence about seeing star wars? You know you are either seeing it or not way before you see a trailer. I like this idea
Twin Peaks the return did this. However, I don’t think even previews would have prepared audiences for Lynch’s insane 18 part trip he took us on in The Return. Star Wars could definitely pull this off. The amount of anticipation would create unbearable excitement for fans...don’t know if this would lower or raise expectations tho
This is one of the only series that can get away with this too 
this should be for every movie
I stopped watching promos about two years ago and I have totally enjoyed the surprise and anticipation in movies again.
Then you can't release merchandise in advance of the movie. Can't see them going for it. 
Perfect, that way the trailer will be just as interesting as the movie.
People would still make assumptions ...


But I hope they bring the mirror of erised back.
Its pretty obvious that they are going to use the Dragon Balls to bring back Yoda and Obi-Wan to create a new jedi order.
Honestly I only saw the teaser for episode 7, and didn't see anything for episode 8. It made the whole thing that much more exciting.
Ahh.. Just make the whole thing an old school animation mixed with live actors musical like Song of South or Pete's Dragons.

Maybe toss in a few actual aliens instead of just tossing out some 'diversity' character. 
In before the "Well, that's certainly better than whatever they can come up with given how terrible TFA and TLJ were. These are very dark times for Star Wars. Fire Kathleen Kennedy." comments.

I've seen many people who hated TLJ say that they're not interested in IX anymore. When pushed with "But you're still gonna watch it", some say, "Yeah, on dvd when it comes out."

Some people had a truly terrible experience with TLJ.

I'm very glad I'm no tone of them. :D :P

I've always thought an interesting way to advertise a movie would be to just give people the sounds from the movie without ever showing a single image.

In any case, I actually think the most likely thing we're gonna see is them advertising the heck out of the Knights of Ren. If JJ doesn't bring them into the story with full force, he doesn't know what he's doing.
Here is why a brand like Star Wars stears away from that kind of advertising: Usually there are 3 kinds of traditional campaines a company can run for publicity, in media one is usually tossed aside leaving an awarness campaine and a branding campain. What you are recommending is an awarness campain, where the point is to be secretive and build crazy hype about a product many people don't know about yet. Since star wars is very established they will most likely go with the branding campain where the simply "rebrand" star wars for this movie, this way is much better for also allowing other companies to use the movie as a way to promote their products for which Disney makes alot of money. In short, the awarness campain you are suggesting would build alot of hype with the known fanbase, but we already know all of them are going to see the movie regardless, so the people they need to convince are the ones who kinda like star wars but could care less, and that is where the branding campain comes in handy.                                         



But of course this is r/crazyideas so maybe they should do it?
I managed to not see one trailer for 8, I think that helped me like the film more than people I've talked to about it. I would be all for them not showing anything about 9. 

But really fuck with people. Red background with just IX in a light shade of white with a black silhouette ~~Jar-Jar~~.  Rey.
already a better movie than episode 8
Considering I missed EVERY bit of info leading up to TLJ, no trailers, no spoiler, no ads, no facebook posts or friend's talking...

You'll still be disappointed. 
Or just don't release it at all, these movies are trash.
This is honestly how I wish these things went to an extent. Just the barest idea of what a movie is like. Just enough to know I want to see it. I never look up trailers anymore. I like to go in as blind as possible. 
eon8
This would honestly be so good
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What is the point?
Husband and I have stopped watching movie trailers altogether. We’ll watch the preview trailers while going to see other movies but we do our absolute best to abstain from anything more than that. There is SO much information about new movies that come out; you see half the movie or cuts of the best scenes before you actually see it. I don’t use social media though and he rarely does so it’s easier for us. 
It'd be the highest grossing movie Disney ever put out.
I still remember when a trailer or teaser came out that somebody from Disney tweeted that people should not see it because it contained spoilers of the movie...

I also don't know when teasers were allowed to be over 2 minutes long. Leave something for the movie. Thank you very much
And the movie would still dissapoint everyone LUL
Make it a black background and we got a deal! 
So.. the matrix
> blank poster with Star Wars logo

And below that, "Who will die this time?"

Then, after a couple of weeks, new posters appear. The top half is blank with the SW logo as before, the bottom half features the face of one of the characters who's still alive along with that character's name followed by a question mark, e.g. "Chewbacca?"
How would we know if we wanted to see it or not?
Honestly with movies this hyped they might as well. Everyone who's going to see it basically already knows they are going to see it. Trailers just cause people to take movies away with their imagination and it doesn't always work out. If you didn't know anything about a movie and you still thought it sucked, then that movie was pretty damn bad
The only thing "crazy" about this idea is that the ads are 30 seconds and not 10.

I think its a good idea

The movie better be damn good.
This is the kind of crazy ideas that I signed up for. This isn’t just some bullshit idea like ‘make everyone on earth my slave’. It’s a legitimate idea that could actually work. But it could also flop catastrophically and taking that chance would really be crazy
I feel the same about a Quentin Tarantino
Star Trek!
You can tell a lot of people in here don’t work in marketing. 


But how would the rabid fan base know what to cosplay as? How would the 400 trailer reaction videos that spawn every few minutes have enough content to sustain their thought-provoking channels? 
See this is why they hire marketing people.
People would die. 
That is how the original Matrix was advertised
GABBO!

*GABBO!!*

#*GABBO!!!*
Could be said for basically any movie trailer now.

I didn't enjoy Prometheus much when I did finally go see it, but I do remember seeing a teaser trailer that was just that loud noise and a few shots of the ship and I was so impressed, and excited to see it.
People will still bitch about it
Are most of the products we buy actually that awesome? Or are we all just buying a bunch of hot-air hype?
Why would the posters say “on posters”?
yeah, this is why Reddit doesnt run studio marketing.
Therefore no one would have any pre expectations of the film!  no crazy angry nerds!
This was my experience for 8. Saw nothing. Read nothing. Went in completely blind and it was awesome
Well at least I won't go in with high expectations
This isn't crazy. I haven't watched trailers since the first iron Man. They give away way to damn much.
I suggested this for Episode 7. Nobody listened.
That would get me about as excited as I am currently for episode 9, which is not at all. 

If they wanted some cool hype around episode 9 they should have made a good episode 8. 
With the way the series is going the could also just release a poster that's literally a picture of a pile of shit and it would convey the same message. 
I think that trailers are pretty easy to avoid if you don't want to be spoiled. From a marketing perspective, having big moments in your trailers actually boosts box office sales. 

I've heard that it was of the reasons why Bladerunner 2049 didn't do so well despite being a good movie. They avoided spoiling any big moments in their trailers at the cost of hype.

Most people actually like the draw of knowing what leads up to the big hype moments. If you don't you should simply avoid trailers, honestly.

A muted marketing campaign is an incredibly terrible idea from every angle.
Lol
Thats how I wish all trailers were
Please dont?
/r/im14andthisisdeep
Crazy idea Disney, pay ridiculous amounts of money for advertising as usual, but don’t actually advertise anything because some fuckboi thinks he’s smarter than your entire marketing team. 
Edit: Pepper costs xtra bitch
It would work for people who WANT to my hyped but in honestly, the large majority of the general public need to be hyped to go and see it. That means trailers, press, posters, etc.
An app that lets you invite an anonymous person to act as a neutral third party when having an argument
> That person could join conference-room style. Then at the end of the argument each party can rate him.

**edit:** wow that blew up! Let’s make this a real thing!

**edit 2:** it is now in beta, check out /r/ArbiterApp :D
"You're both wrong shut the fuck up"
I can see it now... universal 2.5 star ratings
Make this and I'll buy it.
Haha, this idea is actually amazing. 
Call it Arbiter.

Giving random people on the internet a position of authority... /r/WhatCouldGoWrong? 
This is a brilliant idea dude. Skype style or you can type it out.
[deleted]
You'll just get 14yo trolls chiming in with bullshit not resolving anything.
Each party to the argument has to put up their CC. The loser of the argument pays 1 dollar to the judge.
I like this idea so long as the argument isn’t about religion, sports or politics considering it’s nearly impossible for anyone to remain completely neutral on those topics
Only allow the votes/ratings 3-5 days after the decision was made. It gives time for the initial rage to wear off and, hopefully, let cooler minds prevail.
This app will be turned into a sex thing. I guarantee it.

One time my coworker and I were having an argument, a friendly argument, but it was escalating. We decided to bring a third person into the talk for this exact purpose, thinking it was a great idea. 

What did the third person do? Took out a pen and started keeping scores while not saying a word. This just Made us cracked up laughing so the argument was ended
mediator requested
This is the best idea I’ve ever heard. We need a subreddit for people to post their requests. Pm me the name of the subreddit when there is one, I’ll be looking ! Or if someone wants to develop the idea to make it an Alexa skill, I’ll work with that. She could give pros and cons to a problem you propose 
1. This idea is great
2. Definitely should be called "mediator" or "moderator" or something like that.
awesome idea for an app
and the name for it should be “third party “

It sounds exhausting but incredibly helpful of the third person.
Umm this is fucking brilliant, please make this app, I need it! However, Im just gonna throw it out there that if there was an option to pay that "anonymous person" to fucking say I'M right, I would almost never not use it.
I do this every other day with my room mates, They argue over stupid shit and i have to talk them through it and translate what they mean when they start screaming at each other.
Most of the time they are saying the same thing but interrupting the others sentence.
Holy shit this sounds incredible 
The person who loses rates them 0, winner rates them 10.

Edit: spelling 
It should invite three people instead in case that one person is a retard, the other two can outvote them. 
And put it on blockchain? 
Who says that anonymous person would be neutral though
Yeah I would like to receive an invitation to mediate an *argument* between two druglords 
You can do that now with uber and just have an argument in someones car. 
A mechanism by which a third party can butt into an argument and add their own judgments and commentary? They have that already; it’s called “the Internet”, and it was largely agreed to have been a dreadful mistake.
This is actually a good idea. If I had the know-how I'd definitely make the app.
Was this really organic? I think it's a great idea, but it's a little suspect that you are an Android dev...
There's a seriously underrated app that involved random people around the world calling you to wake you up. Guess caters more for the extroverts though.
E: its called Wakie 
First question on third party application;  was Shaggy caught red-handed?
Is cheesecake cake? Is water wet? Which religion is true?
That's it were asking the next person. Best 2 out of 3. 
there's a podcast called judge john Hodgman which has a premise almost identical to this. Two people bring their trivial problem to the "judge" and he decides who's right.
I actually think this is a good idea OP. 
Damn, I'd use this when arguing with my wall of bricks mom
I could have used this for SIX YEARS!! 
mistakes were made...
Too many trolls and online voting never works well (see many examples including thedonald subreddit, gushing granny Mountain Dew flavor, etc.)

Reminds me of the idea of the "Fair Witness" in Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land

http://shardsofconsciousness.com/how-to-be-a-fair-witness
This sounds like an idea Todd would come up with in BoJack Horseman.

I can hear him now. "Oh MAN.  You both make really good points."
Huge flaw in this idea : being a complete stranger doesn't make you Neutral.
RemindMe 1 year "is it real"
I feel like, like reddit, it can attract trolls. Ratings might not help if the winner rates em high and the loser low

I give this idea a 5/7.

They won't be neutral, they'll agree with whoever is closest to agreeing with them.
Look up an app called Medusa!! Very similar idea of being anonymous in a group setting in chat/messenger!! Apple and android pretty sure btw 
Well I'm pretty sure she's bat shit crazy but I'd like a second opinion...
Alright, alright- Jim makes a good point, you’re argument is mostly made on conjecture Susan. If you keep shouting out numbers without sourcing where they came from you’re just being a dick. 

Jim, stop shouting over Susan because it doesn’t make what your saying true, it’s just wrong but louder. 

Now that that’s settled, EVeRYone GIve Me YOu’Re GODdAmN WaLLets!
With a premium feature to rig the neutral third party, with EA style micro transactions 
I’d buy it!
I would pay to use this for sure. Trouble is getting the other person to agree to use it too in the heat of BATTLE 

Edit: ...heat of an argument is what I meant 
Okay I'm as amused as everyone else, but there's a few reasons this is a shitty idea for anything but casual disagreements:

1.	Many arguments stem from a difference in values and perspective, not factual disagreements. Adding a third party is not a neutral voice, but rather an *additional* set of values and perspectives to reconcile. You're mistaking uninvolved for neutrality.         Helping people resolve interpersonal disagreements is typically done best with someone *specifically trained* to help people better see and discus the underlying issues/value conflicts (i.e. therapists and other mediators). Being able to do this without inserting your own values and bullshit is a skill that random people on the internet are very unlikely to have.
2.	You're gonna get a few select people that have those skills. The vast majority of other people will very likely not help or actively make the situation worse unintentionally. That's not even including trolls.
3.	The best way to deal with relationship issues is to try to view it as the two of you vs an issue, that you work together to resolve. Your system inherently frames it adversarially.
4.	This is related to the first thing, but there's often not one objective truth to these things. Presenting it as if there is or as if conflict can be resolved with someone else giving you and answer is naive.
5.	Even when one party is 100% correct, conflict is resolved through emotional labor, not some rando on the internet telling you you're wrong.
Medi-Eight
---This is Fantastic!
Damn, such an app would be perfect for trolling, like  
Q: "We broke up, how will we decide who gets the puppy?"  
A: "Cut it in two equal sized halves and each of you gets one."  
  
Q: "Roomie gave me cash for a pizza half, he ate the whole one and left nothing for me. I'm hungry, what can i do?"  
A: "Make him puke out your half or wait for his bowel movement and eat that."
This is great. 
So r/legaladvice where both parties are present? This is a great idea

Also it'd naturally be the royal third party, which would bring the outcome closer to true justice, because it'd be a majority opinion 
So, essentially modifying teletherapy couple's counseling to an app, with the understanding that not all of the duos arguing are couples? 
Y'all should just argue with your partner less
Can we please have an app like this? World peace would be found.
Thought that was reddit? 

Must be doing it wrong, explains the down votes....
You should try Omegle 
openbazaar does this for disputes in purchases, it's called arbitration, and arbiters get paid to settle disputes..
This is the app that brings world peace. 
So you want to digitize arbitration contracts
I'd actually love to side with random strangers, the possibilities are endless
Naturally, the winning party would rate the arbiter positively & the other one negatively. So add one more anonymous person to the argument to rate the arbiter.
Can some bot somewhere on here alert me if someone actually makes this?!?
I would stir so much shit.
If most people weren't incapable of actually being neutral this wouldn't be such a crazy idea.
Judge Dreddit
I would love to be the 3rd party negotiator lol I’d probably spend a couple hours a day on it tbh
It’ll need a mute button for the mediator
 They have online counselors via app it whatever... does that count? 
Why not just make an “Argument Solvers” sub? 
I remember back when Omegle wasn't all fuck ads and bots, there was a mode where you could ask a question and watch two people chat about it. That or chat with a random person about someone's question. It was pretty cool.
Just text a random number.  Someone did this to me regarding how to pronounce gif.
Haha a judge Judy app 
This would force the arguers to posit their views carefully, which would be a boon to society as a whole.

Therefore it will not work
Some people might get killed in a couple of these arguments 
Brilliant. And records the argument 
Call it ChribbaX
What if they already have a bias?
Minimum mediator age 30. By then you start to have enough life experience to give advice and help.
Man, imagine if Bill Burr could be that neutral party.
Must rate the Arbitr before they give their ruling
Mediatr
There used to be a website that did this, back in the Web 2.0 days. The main difference being that both parties put up their arguments and counterarguments, and then users voted -- not just a single arbitrator. It was actually pretty fun and had an active community.
A+ Idea OP. Could really be on to something
I feel like this is a sly way of saying 'couples therapy'...
Judge Judy app!
What if that person was wrong as well though? :/
And then the third person joins the argument and they have to bring a fourth person in
You know, we really don't need an app, just make a subreddit! Reddit is the perfect format for something like this
Seems this would lead to less petty arguments.
If the argument isn't worth using the app, it's probably not worth having in the first place.
Umm... marriage counseling? 
Bro. This is the 3rd time in a row. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to do this for you.

Knock it off and find someone else if this is how you want to be. Also if you think I'm doing that on Monday you are out of your mind crazy because I'm not even gonna show up, 
That's called counselling.
Now I have to yell at two people? And what if that guy calls another? This is just too much violence.
so much trolling potential. I love it.
What if the third party believes all parties are wrong? And the third party gets into an argument with both? 
Then people discover the reason why "moderates" get hated like the messenger that's killed.
Doesn't matter, she still right.
!remindme when someone makes this app.
My girlfriend and I would kindly love a third opinion about our quarrel.  
this is actually amazing. 
The world needs this!
Nah mate.  Jury of 12 from your area.  Structured like a trial, followed by deliberation where the parties can't participate, only watch and listen.
You mean wikipedia?
I like the idea, but it may leave you open to a sign gle person jury bias, make it a panel of 20 deciding who's right, that should eliminate possible bias, and don't make then "nearby" users, the farther the better, sicit won't be a friend or family 
Troll amplifier ... Unless you have some sort of credit or credibility the arbitrators can build up.
I like being that person. Someone make this please

Dude, I think the idea is great, and I'm almost crazy enough to code it. The problem is that I know how much time it takes to build a decent app, and I got a kid coming in 2.5 months.

Still, the idea is awesome and there's already a group of people who would use it. I'm gonna start playing around tonight. Does anybody want to work on an Android version? I know iOS, but I got nothing on Android.
The main problem I can see with this is that the third party would have to volunteer for that role, and the kind of people who would be attracted to that kind of thing are... probably not the people you want deciding who's right and who's wrong.  It'll be mostly know-it-alls who think they're so great that they should be making decisions for *everybody*, and would use the app as a way to boost their own ego.

Edit: As someone else mentioned, it'll also be an absolute disaster when a troll volunteers to be the third party.  Man, trolls would *love* this app.
Hey, is there a copy right on this idea? I know a bit of code, id be down.
This is actually genius. 
Define impartiality, show me how you might determine it in people, and this could work.
Who argues that much to need that?  If you do, dump the toxic relationships.  There ARE apps for that. 
That job would have to pay a lot because listening to people bicker as a job would lead to suicide. 
Giving a random person power? Doesn't sound good
I do this with my friends. We call it Petty Court. I, the honorable Judge Buddy, use reinactments, spontaneous witness accounts, and equal talking time to help conclude a balanced and agreeable solution. 
Pretty good idea, don’t ya think, honeys.5?

I can't believe this didn't already exist.

They have arbiters and moderators for actual, live discussion or arguments you can hire (like that episode of It's Always Sunny but hopefully less crazy). It makes sense that there would be an online tool for the same purpose, possibly with a monetary fee for the arbiter/moderator.
This is not a crazy idea at all. One step closer to replacing the courts.  Which in turn is one step closer to replacing the state.  Which in turn will eliminate most of the worlds violence.
I want to be a mediator!
Unless that person had patience it would just be a bunch of "OMG WILL BOTH OF YOU STOP TALKING"

1-4-105.Pronunciation of state name.

Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.

And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history and the early usage of the American immigrants.

Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final “s” silent, the “a” in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of “a” in “man” and the sounding of the terminal “s” is an innovation to be discouraged.

I never understood this.  People get really upset when you pronounce the 'S' at the end of Illinois.  It's understood by most that it's silent due to its French-Indian roots.  But I hear more people saying you should pronounce the same 'S' at the end of Arkansas than agreeing with its actual pronunciation.  Even though it comes from similar French Indian roots as Illinois.  

Anyway, just something I haven't understood.  Seems Kansas should be pronounced Kan-saw.
Nah, it's just as shitty as /r/esist

As a former /r/kansian, I love this. I actually read that there was an archaic law that forbid the name of the state to be pronounced "AR-Kansas" but I don't remember where and for all I know it was bullshit. 

Also, did you know Arkansas has a town called Fifty-Six and it's mayor didn't pay the water bill a few years ago, and thus got it shut off for the entire town. There's also a few towns out in the sticks that have names like Negro Hill, some even using the N-word, and they refuse to change. Of course, these are all towns with several dozens of people, but still.
If it helps, I've just created the /r/Rkansaw subreddit
Goddammit, hasn't Missouri taken enough?!
I found out Arkansas was a state before Kansas. Why is Kansas not pronounced *kin-saw*? If Arkansas came after Kansas I can see why it would be pronounced the way it is. But it is not, and it is strange. It's almost as infuriating as *House-ton* county Georgia, (spelled houston, like the city in Texas). 
I want you to know that I read this, scrolled past it, thought about it for 5 minutes then scrolled back up specifically to upvote this. You are fucking brilliant!
What's up with Arkansas being on reddits radar lately? 
So I can say "Ar - slash - kansaw"?

I live in a little Town called Mtn View Arkansas and it's really nice. I've lived all iver the country including several years in Alaska. I went to college I. Russellville, AR which is an amazing college town which is not too big and not too small.

Now the Delta region of Arkansas is awful, flat, and shod be avoided. But the mountains and nicer cities are good. 
Oh and I should clarifyrify I love this State as a great place to settle and raise kids. I started partying and having fun at a young age, so I got a lot of that out of my system early​. 

As I mentioned in my last post we live In a beautiful small town, but it's. Very conservative, and they don't even sell booze here. The college town are great though

[Well, it's not Arkansas' fault, really...](https://youtu.be/8Ybj2BBnbS4?t=48s)
I'm from Kansas and I'll approve
Make r/Kansas great again
It's not your Kansas, and it's not my Kansas.  It's Arkansas.  
Honestly forgot Arkansas was a state til I saw this post 
Kansas is way less white trash than Arkansas. Way less. 
Being from Arkansas, I approve.
I've never understood why we pronounce it Arkansaw instead of like it's spelled.
